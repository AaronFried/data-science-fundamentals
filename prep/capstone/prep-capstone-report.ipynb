    "As online communities have gained traction in the 'real world', journalists have worked to understand and explain them. So far, their attempts have come up short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical method is to cover an online community the same way you'd cover a mass political movement. Understandably so — both can consist of millions of people, united by some common thread and therefore all doing something together. A rally and an online community, however, are profoundly different. The rally is a simple creature: everyone attending supports some stated mission, and they show that support in a singular way — marching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online communities, however, present a massively more complex problem. Rather than marching as one behind the banner of a cause, online communities are decentralized and spontaneous. As a 'member' — if that label even applies — you are individual with your own voice. You attend if and when you please, engage in whichever way you see fit, and are not required to march in anyone's parade.\n",

Peterson's message is interpreted by the left-leaning journalist as reactionary against modern third-wave (for those of you counting at home) feminism. They then see that it attracts white men. They infer that, since it is a reactionary movement of white men, that these men are struggling back against the social gains of other classes — and are therefore angry.\n",
