    "# Hunting Jordan Peterson's angry mob\n",
    "\n",
    "As online communities have gained traction in the 'real world', journalists have worked to understand and explain them. So far, their attempts have come up short. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the critical news coverage of Jordan Peterson's rise to international fame — he's been called the world's most influential public intellectual. \n",
    "\n",
    "But opinion about him are polarized. Peterson's detractors see him as a dangerously regressive influence, perpetuating bigotry and provoking violence. In stark contrast, his supporters are a devoted online community. With over 1 million subscribers on his YouTube channel — which primarily features his university lectures — Peterson's viewers eagerly support his work. As of this writing, he has nearly 9,500 patrons on Patreon (each of these people is happily donating at least $1 per month).\n",
    "\n",
    "What explains the divide?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Peterson stepped into the culture war, sparking a global political controversy that launched him into mainstream media coverage. After Canada's parliament passed Bill C-16, which added transgender people as a protected class under Canada's human rights code, [Peterson argued](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQD8oW-mqWpKumeqglQCe6VZ) that the new law compelled people to use certain pronouns — a violation of free speech. Between this and his sharp criticisms of identity politics, Peterson raised the ire of the political left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, criticism followed the spotlight.  [Many](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/19/cathy-newman-the-internet-is-being-written-by-men-with-an-agenda) [mainstream](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/cathy-newman-abuse-channel-4-jordan-peterson-metoo-backlash-latest-a8170031.html) [articles](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/is-jordan-peterson-the-stupid-mans-smart-person/) [have](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/19/jordan-peterson-and-fascist-mysticism/) [categorized](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/02/jordan-peterson-enlightenment-nietzsche-alt-right) Dr. Peterson as a backwards misogynist, backed by an online horde of _angry white men_ who spit vitriol at anyone who dares to debate him.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of Peterson's audience, this contradicts my observations. While Tweets and YouTube comments are rarely high-brow, his audience seems normal (or better) to me. I also attended one of his lectures in New York and saw a curious and eager group of mostly young professionals — not screaming skinheads nor embittered incels. My impressions, however, could have been clouded by my biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the journalists above know something I don't. Perhaps they're more biased than we realize. If we simply rely on our gut reactions to a handful of comments, however, we'll never be able to grasp what online communities of millions think. We need high resolution tools to understand this question, not emotional heuristics. We're going to use solid data to analyze the claims of these journalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out our analysis, we'll scrape the comments from a few dozen YouTube videos — some involving Jordan Peterson, others without the controversial professor; some on intellectual topics, others from pop culture. Then, we'll perform semantic analysis on the comments. We can test polarity, which shows whether the tone is positive or negative, and mood, which (as you may expect) tells us which moods are expressed by a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, we will be able to prove (or falsify) the claim that Jordan Peterson's audience is abnormally negative and angry towards those who disagree with him. Let's start by pulling in our datasets.\n",

    "- The tone of a video's comments depends more on the video's genre and type than the specific YouTuber's audience.\n",
    "- Peterson's commenters were consistent in tone with our other intellectual genre videos, and their subtypes: lectures and debates.\n",
    "- Audience mood can vary more within an audience, but on an overall basis, Jordan Peterson's audience does not have an overrepresentation of anger.\n",
    "- Specifically among debates, Jordan Peterson's audience actually has less negative moods than a general debate audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this brings us to our conclusion: Jordan Peterson's audience is neither abnormally negative nor abnormally angry towards people who disagree with him. The journalists who wrote with such certitude in the articles linked above were incorrect. But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Peterson's detractors are primarily political commentators — they're trained in analyzing mass political movements, and they are applying the same framework to interpret an online community. At a glance, these two groupings might seem similar: both can consist of millions of people, united by some common thread and therefore all doing something together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rally and an online community, however, are profoundly different. The rally is a simple creature: everyone attending supports some stated mission, and they show that support in a singular way — marching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online communities, however, present a massively more complex problem. Rather than marching as one behind the banner of a cause, online communities are decentralized and spontaneous. As a 'member' — if that label even applies — you are individual with your own voice. You attend if and when you please, engage in whichever way you see fit, and are not required to march in anyone's parade. The fractious diversity and subtle detail of the views in such a community cannot be reduced to a political platform — that model is far too low-resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound that with the leftist political lens Peterson's detractors view the world through: a standard Marxist interpretation of Peterson's message would classify it as reactionary against the advances of modern 'intersectional' feminism. They then see that Peterson attracts white men. They infer that, since it is a reactionary movement of white men, that these men are struggling back against the social gains of other classes — and are therefore angry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, they see angry comments on YouTube and Twitter, their ideological suppositions are confirmed, their blogs are drafted, and then their hot takes are broadcast to the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we know that we don't need to settle for hot takes about our online communities. As millions of people rapidly filter into these new social units, journalists need an interpretive framework to understand how masses of individuals interact on the internet. Let this be the first small step in that direction."
