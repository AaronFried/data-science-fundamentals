I have heard most ideas and points he makes by now after all the content that is out there that I've watched, but I still get goosebumps every once in awhile when he drops some knowledge or points something out that should be obvious to everyone.

That demonology is Psychology. the hierarchy of Demons are the classified aspects of the Human mind... and as many of us know.. enlightenment is found on the other side of darkness. one must challenge their shadow.. their demons in order to understand themselves fully.. which means. embracing and fundamentally understanding your own capacity for evil, deceptiveness, and wickedness. each of these demons has a job, a function. a group of negative acts which he/she oversee's and pushes into the human construct and the act of ""summoning and learning to control"" each of these demons or ""potential aspects of the human condition"" affords a set of positive rewards.. in the same way that if one is impatient... accepting one is impatient.. harnessing this ""demon"" results in one becoming more patient and lax..and as a result more in control of themselves...demonology is quite literally.. psychology in its early yet partially more advanced form."

UgzZYRBaKSAB46nvrld4AaABAg,Personable Person,1533318244794,"I love how Peterson really explains some of his views on Christianity here, particularly when talking about the self-authoring programme.
As an atheist, I used to think he was pretty slimy on the topic of Christianity, redefining words and undermining his opponent, but that's not really what he's doing.
He just thinks in very abstract terms.
He doesn't take the Bible as literally as even ""moderate"" Christians do. I think that's a mistake a lot of his detractors make when on the topic of his religion.
It's like, well yeah, heaven and hell are real when you think about it like JP does. They're not literal places where you'll be tortured for eternity or live in eternal happiness. They're more like a state of being. Hell is the absolute worst position you could be in in your life. Heaven is the absolute best. If you follow modern Christian doctrine you'll reach Heaven (the absolute best position in you could be in), and if you do the opposite, you'll fall to Hell (the absolute worst position you could be in). Or at least, that's how Jordan Peterson conceptualises it."

UgyTX9VBqkCkmI3krUN4AaABAg,Sashka Viskovatov,1532713444822,"Actually Dr. Peterson remembered it right, it was zyclone B, not A, which was used to kill Jews. 

It was kinda funny to notice that Joe approaches the topic of meaning of life completely differently by just saying that everyone has his own, makes it sound like it's so complicated that he didn't even try to get into it. It's totally true on the one hand, but on the other Dr. Peterson makes the topic seemingly simple, like he just assumes that it will manifest itself when you try to make things right, have your own life in order as much as you can. To be honest I don't know which one is closer to the truth. 

I guess the most important what Dr. Peterson mentions is that society is a tyrant but that's not all what it is. The hierarchy has been here forever ant that's what we're adapted to. If you take it away..."

UgwFFQ5uTpODUEx9_EN4AaABAg,Andre Lamothe,1532713444848,None of this i would have even given  a second thought if it weren't for these long form discussions.  This guys heart is in everything he talks about and you can see that he always tries his hardest to give educated answers and if he can't he admits he can't or that he doesnt have enough information but still gives a  very honest opinion on everything  There is no reason for anyone to think  he is racist or against trans gender . If they were using the same format but instead of trans people they used rich people  as they're vessel to get this bill  passed in Canada would anyone say he's against baseball players no  i think  more people would be behind him

I really like your conversational style of interviewing, but I would also like to see people who have radical different views of the political landscape hash out their differences in a controlled format. Sometimes I feel like both Petersons claims, and Seders, gets to og unchallenged when they only talk amongst their peers and within the borders of their own monologues. I know the Youtube community and your fanbase would love such an episode. Sincerly, a devoted fan."

UgzBkhHh7YO14jT4HFd4AaABAg,SixSixSix,1532454253272,"I really like Jordan a lot, and this is a fantastic interview, BUT : 
I have to very STRONGLY disagree with JP's sentiments at about 2:33:55 , about people complaining about ""the richest 1%"" -- ie. his screwed-up generalisation about who these people are and what their motives are : 
They are in no way all  super-far-left ideologues chanting slogans and trying to get the benefits of being rich and poor : that is a total bullshit blanket-categorisation and characterization, and I'm disgusted that he made it : 

There is completely legitimate concern among many people (I would say any reasonable and intelligent person who also has concerns beyond their immediate surroundings) about who holds all the money and power in America within the 1% of America itself -- (excluding global concerns). 

(These people also have nothing to do with the type of ridiculous person he describes who believe all human interaction is based on power-play.)

He should look at the true wealth distribution curve within America 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjQm83F0MhQ

There are some absolutely disgusting individuals and companies who hold all this wealth, and in some cases their actions and behaviour are horrific almost beyond comprehension -- 
Bankers, banking cartels , owners of intertwined multi-nationals --- 

JP's defense of this form of wealth-distribution is indefensible. 
He should check himself there.

I am in no way a communist, but I think there is a very sensible argument for a cap on how much money any one individual can or should have : Like, does an individual really need more than $1 billion , or $10 billion? 
I'd make a vote for $10 billion dollars on an individual's wealth and asset holdings."

UgxjV3Pl2CBeHRtFsuB4AaABAg,Lolerez,1532454253366,"Modern marxism has taken the previous version of marxism where previously, the oppressor and the oppressed was based on economic standing. The oppressor was the capitalist or the bourgeois who would oppress the proletariat through economic means. Marxism considered those who worked for someone to be a slave to the economic system of capitalism, and owning the means of production under one common identity was the way to achieve equal economic outcome. However, Modern marxism has focused on having equal social outcome through a socioeconomic standpoint, where you social standing can directly correlate with your economic status. Modern marxism has replaced the rich bourgeois with the cis white male and the proletariat with various minority groups. Just as the rich were robbed to achieve equal outcome, decreasing the social heirachy for white people (specifically straight white men), and puttting various minority groups at a inherent and systematic advantage, they have achieved what is a equallity of outcome for the previously disenfranchised minority groups, hoping to achieve socioeconomic equality."

He of course has a right to his opinion and orientation etc, in the same way I do. What bothers me about him though is the absolute authority he speaks with as if his word is fact and truth; yes he's a smart guy, but theres many just as intelligent and educated as him supporting a postmodernist perspective. He's scathing against it to the point where he's giving an audience that probably aren't well read in it an unbelievably biased and skewed view of Derrida, whilst also dismissing and oversimplifying Foucault. Yes this is one take on it, but I'd say please don't take his word by itself, read into it yourself and form your own opinion rather than just going along with Petersons demonisation of 'french intellectuals'."

If you are a female of the species, your main BIOLOGICAL function is to breed.  That's why 1) people give human females such a hard time for literally bearing more trouble into the world, and 2) women need to be on the front lines to help people change their attitudes to stop breeding.

So after spending 4 days reading/watching more on Peterson. LISTENING to his full thought process not just the sentence people use to create click bait off of to serve their brand of victim profiteering or social media activism...

I find the man measured, thoughtful, diverse in his pallet of info he is consuming and referencing and by and large in line with many of my own sensibilities in wondering why...why are we being forced to give deference to certain groups/causes over others and why is it okay to build policy on non-scientific or ambiguously gathered data fueled by a reactionary sense of moral accountability to do the right thing not because it is right, but because it is trendy or that lobby has the finance/PR that could effect positioning in certain environments.   

I hate that someone I respect like Bomani had to be the one to try to have me attacked, but it was another wake up call that those that look like you and even share your sensibilities will still be okay with things you know are wrong...you can't blindly follow your perceived group...group think is almost always a setup for failure."

I think he is really missing the point of what goals people like Dawkins and Harris are pursuing. Jordan likes to redefine religion and god in a completely different way, but he fails to adequetely acknowledge what most religious people actually believe. Harris and Dawkins are targeting the fundamentalists who try to force religion into scientific domain. They are speaking about the toxic, devisive and dangerous ideas that religion brews.

Dawkins and Harris both have acknowledged that there is beauty, poetry and wisdom in religious texts. Sam has devoted an incredible amount of time to spirituality. He has lot of the same goals Jordan has. The only difference is thst he refuses to subscribe to a particular doctrine because there is no good reason to think any of them is anymore true than the other even in the metaphorical sense that Jordan subscribes to.

This goes to the heart of my problem with Peterson. He acknowledges that all the religions, contain great valuable truths in the metaphorical sense and so do lot's of other forms of literature like fiction as does Harris. So why does he subscribe to a one single doctrine as if it was more valuable than the others.

The advantage of a secular moral doctrine is that you have infinite sources to draw from and they are open to skepticism, discussion and revision and religions in their most toxic form have none of that, which makes them so destructive. Jordan clearly acts as he has more of a secular moral system, but insists on clinging to this diluted form of Christianity."

He speaks the absolute truth and people bring weapons of malice to shut him up. They can't handle the truth, and rather than engaging in a civil discourse they resolve to irrational fits.

This is the reason I generally hate evolutionary biology arguments, because they're doing the same thing that the post modern idiots are doing, framing arguments to suite their needs. It's natural for there to be a hierarchy, so please don't fight it. His argument would be better served to just admit that all of these ideas are competing hierarchies. Also, his story of fighting the dragon and getting the Virgin, didn't seem like there was much choice for her... look, I agree with him that we need to have discussions, rational one at that, but let's not pretend that he gets paid to speak and lecture.

The only reason he's hailed as someone revolutionary rather than just a sensible bloke is because our society has become so saturated with bullshit, stupid politics and denial of critical thinking.

These people on campuses who spend all their time harassing or attacking visiting speakers are fucking morons. They are not fit to study at a university, because they are incapable of absorbing or even reflecting on any views other than their own."

By all means live your life.. identify as a fruit cake if you want. But as a parent I'll be damned if my children won't know the truth about this massive lie of genders and race and political parties the state of the laws in this country or I should say color of law. As parents it's our jobs to teach our children. And that's where the failure begins. It's undisputable. The same way you wouldn't let your kid eat cake for every meal or or not to just run across the intersections without looking. This is all to do with parents enveloped in themselves and indirectly hanging their children out to dry. I struggle everyday in a battle with my X who happens to be my children's Mother. She has this dippity-do she's the boss, that they're her children not our children type attitude. but then does nothing for them other than a roof over their head and food on the table. That's not a parent. Parent is not letting your kid run the streets and not know who they're running with. To not know the family of who they're running with. Do not teach them why things are wrong and just say because I said.. Just teaching them to be polite and well-mannered is not enough . your child should be the main focus of your life. And the kids main focus should be directed towards things that will help them in life to have  a pleasant reality not how to hide from and avoid life and be miserable in your reality. Nothing is free. Everything takes work. Children do not just grow up good productive people. Good food good conversations good debates good physical activities good hygiene kids need to be challenged they should be stimulated not suppress and told no to everything that they want to try because you want to drink a beer and relax and bothered. The only way to end Arrested Development is to force your children to deal with life not hide from it. Confrontation is always a good thing. How else do you learn to stick up for yourself and deal with people in general. I'm not saying violence. Mistakes are very good thing. But not if you're not educated on why things are a mistake this topic hits home because it's my greatest fear for my children to end up in this confused surreal world without the right tools. Spirituality it's super important. Not religious but spiritual. But when I express any of this to my children's Mother she thinks I'm a nut period and tells me nobody cares about the books I read. And herein lies the problem. What if I wasn't here to balance out her thinking. Here's an example for you my daughter tells me at 10 years old that she don't need nobody. Well my daughter doesn't realize and what enrages me inside, is that she doesn't realize mommy's living off Welfare child support and other men. Which is the problem. She doesn't understand Welfare and child support destroy family. Why can't you get help if the father lives in the house. Why can't you get help unless you bring up a child support case against the father. Why do the courts mainly side with women in any context really. So needless to say I said a few words to my daughter to point out where her mistake was. Point is parenting from beginning to end of all the problems going on in society today has to do with parenting or lack of it. Nobody should be spending enough time to influence your child against what you know is right. And to take it a step further if somebody is in your child's ear you need to confront that person and make them stop. And if it's a school typesetting you need to start showing your child the facts lead by example show how morally bankrupt all these people are but mainly focus on your children and be a real parent."

Which I don't know what confuses me more, the fact that he nearly ruined his life, and ability to partake in his hobby long term for a short term session with said hobby, or the fact that it was Destiny, which anyone that has played it knows it isn't exactly a prize chicken by any stretch of the imagination.

Like, I didn't realize that's how much I made. I better go look for the 5k I'm missing out on. College students are making even less than that. So it doesn't take a genius to figure out why people are complaining about the income inequality in this country. Since just because you're an american, instead of some 3rd world country, doesn't guarantee you 34k+ a year. Also you have to figure that the cost of living in this country is dramatically higher than it takes to live in the other countries.

Just because you can live like a king in Mexico on 25k a year doesn't mean it's very fun to do the same in the US. That's like the only thing I disagree with in all the podcasts I saw this guy on."

Im totally speculating but one might think that a postmodern neo-marxist's ideal of a european society would be one where everyone's consciousness is uploaded into some sort of Super computer or AI and eroding the concept of the individual seems to be something that would be necessary in order to justify doing such a thing. I think the reason that this is such an important topic is not only that this is an attack on free speech but another attack on people's right to their own individual Identity.

Think about it.  He isn't superhuman in any way, but he's considered to be the leader of the avengers.  Why is that?  It's because he is the ideal human being in every sense of the word.  That goes deeper than physical ability.  When he took the magic potion in the war, he was told it would push every aspect of his being to its peak human level.  That doesn't just mean physical aspects.

Dr. Erskine tells Steve Rogers that this potion will accentuate the aspects of his morality as well as his physical ability, and that's why he chose him for the experiment.

So what does the story of captain america tell us about what we ought to aspire to achieve as people?  Well, look at what Dr. Peterson says here and connect it to captain america.

Captain America is considered to be the leader of the Avengers, not Tony Stark.  Why?  Captain America is at the peak level of understanding between good and evil.  He was a war hero, he witnessed his monster and controlled it.  He was a good man, and that's why he was chosen for to become what he is.  He is the leader of the Avengers because at the points of total chaos and evil, he is the one who always speaks the truth, he is the one who people look to for moral guidance.  This is the kind of aspiration that Peterson wants us to achieve when we consider our own demons."

This may already be beyond a tide that will turn soon, but there is hope that we turned away from dynastic radical leftist indoctrination (despite its imperfections). It is up to the PEOPLE, not the GOVERNMENT, to now find a rational & compassionate way forward ALL humans together. ""We are not Doom, but we must each clean our own Room."" Despite the cynicism of Joe Rogan (just beyond healthy skepticism) the chaos is here, and hopefully Joe will be too when the dust settles. We will need that healthy skepticism when he does realize the dire nature of our current situation (all peoples of all walks). The President does not rule alone, but the President does not need to be undermined to ineffectiveness. We The People Chose This Chaos, This Fight. The America we fight for is not one to be decided by the unassimilated outsider. Despite the moving and shaking that this country creates, this country stands firm, even as the world around it crumbles in its social and physical structure. My thoughts as of right now. To help: separate the myth from the action. A ""sh1tp0ster"" is part of the archetype, not evidence that an archetype is not playing out, but evidence of the archetype itself."

It's a shame that competent people appearently doesn't want to confront this guy in discussion, as he clearly seems to have an unprecise understanding of postmodernism and marxism. Postmodernism is, by definition, anti-ideological. It is a reaction to the modern notion of scientific progress as inherently good. Marxist social science on the other hand is fundamentally a modern way analyzing and understanding social and material structures.

A philosopher such as Michel Foucault simply point at the fact that our understanding of the world around us is socially constructed. He also pointed at the fact that this construct resulted in certain structures of power. However, he stressed that his theories were anti-ideological, and he was certianly not a marxist. He pointed out that postmodernism should be used as a analytical tool, not a ideological one."

(google Vivian Amberville - The Weaver of Odds by Louise Blackwick).

Vivian Amberville follows the story of an orphaned girl whose imagination holds the power to ""reshape the fabric of reality"". What's interesting about this story is that Vivian's ability to manifest her thoughts into things (to Weave into the fabric of reality) is moulded very much by Chaos and Imagination, which make her a rather conflicted hero. Chaos and Order exist within her, and she is very much possessed by the Jungian ""Shadow"".

I think it would be a huge justice to society, to Jordan, and to the societal ""middle,"" where I stand. I don't believe that the Right or, especially, the alt right have any place in my America, but neither do I agree with the extremist left.

So the teachers started picking teams and of course I started getting picked towards the end then. Even when i was 10 or whatever the age a 6th grader is I knew what they were doing, but I didn't understand the negative affect it has on kids subconsciously. I mean i didn't care, but it gets this idea in their heads that everyone should be mediated by some higher power because even if you're better at something you shouldn't be treated like it... fuck that shit, of course you should be treated like you're better at something if you are. Look at Elon Musk. I want him to make fuckin rocket ships and send our species to Mars, and I am someone who thinks there needs to be a progressive tax up to 80% for people who make over 10million dollars a year(who really needs more than 2mill a year. really?) unless say you get a deduction for charity or innovative purposes. In short, we need productive people to be rewarded but we can easily use a bit of redistribution(higher taxes on rich) of wealth to make sure we take care of the people in our society who want to be productive but are just dealt a bad hand."

Listening to this kind of conversation is such a pleasure...it almost gives a person a kind of high in a way, or a kind of revelational feeling. Peterson's treatment of archaic/archetypal aspects and the way he just puts them to such logic is always fun to hear. The Snake, the Dragon, the Hero, God, Evil...Honestly the way he breaks down religious ideas makes religion make sense.

And that’s their problem, or one of them at least, they ‘hate speech’. 
They’d rather do anything other than listen to what you have to say because, well, they apparently already have all the answers to western societies’ problems and they hate - vehemently hate - what it is you have to say.
They hate it so much because it directly challenges their ideologies. It makes them uncomfortable having their world view articulately challenged and it’s deeply uncomfortable realising the possibility that your ideology is wrong and you’ve wasted a large portion or all of your life.
Ideologies are dangerous and have proved dangerous and chaotic whenever they attained power and that power has corrupted them into tyrannical Stasi, Gestapo et al. Every. Single. Time. 

Ideologues are zealots and I’ve never liked zealots. I prefer to deal with reasonable people. I don’t care what your beliefs are, I only want to know what you actually know.

Then perhaps we can work together on a solution, based on objective reasoning instead of emotions and closed minds.

UgwVktvaErOmvVcGP6d4AaABAg,agentssith,1516815992235,"@26:00, I have to call Peterson out here. Not to overcriticize, as it is so important to have people like him out there in public view. But I have to take this to task. He mentioned at the beginning his questioning of some of the male allies at McMaster as being creepy or having ulterior motives. I consider this a passive kind of behavior, or perhaps opportunistic. Perhaps it is even 'creepy' though I have a distaste for that term. It is easily as bad as throwing around the term slutty toward women, haphazardly. So my problem is this. These are post-modernists, mostly females, actually driving, initiating this kind of backlash or using trans people as an excuse to trot out their ideology. Why are they not considered 'creepy' for doing so? Why is Peterson so comfortable using this kind of terminology in describing men, but not women? Does he fear he doesn't possess sufficient charisma to popularize that? Because I am pretty sure he does. He has come under fire for rightly saying that a man has no physical recourse to deal with women, but his philosophy is ultimately a dead end to me, because it is so one-sided in this way. Couple post-modern thought with the fact that women tend to wholly sub-contract out to the male dominance hierarchy, and this is where the problem lies. Why do men need a meta message of encouragement and acceptance of responsibility? Seems to me women need this much more than men do. As do they need their own hierarchy instead of farming out to the male one that they can't decide (using that very post modernism) if they like or want to abide by or not. Women tend also to be hypo-agentic as well. Women don't sort their lives out, not cerebrally anyway (Peterson unconsciously, almost mystically, pedestalizes women in this way IMO). What isn't controlled by their bilogical crypsis/ hypergamy is farmed out to male dominance hierarchy (rather dubiously I might add). We have fuck all reason to keep talking about this the way we are. JBP is a traditionalist, and he can't justify any more reason to think meta about men and ask them to man up any more than women. For whatever reason he avoids the latter, but this needs the most work. How about we chart new territory here?"

The fact that Jordan thinks postmodernism is even a unified field shows how little he fuckn knows. That's what you get when you read Stephen Hicks' book on post modernism but have never even read and of the continental philosophy apart from Nietzsche. The irony of it all is that Jordan Peterson IS a post modernist while proceeding to be the most verbal hater of it. I guess that explains his nietzschean ressentiment towards the field ""post modernism."" Or the fact that he calls every other discipline corrupt (even english lit!! OH NOOO NOT ENGLISH LITERATURE I HEAR THE SCREAM) even though psychology is perhaps the most corrupt field of the 20th century.

The only thing of consequence is the ""like"" of people on virtual spaces where no one represents their real identity. They carry that comment culture identity over from the virtual spaces to reality and think that they are right without debate - as it has already been decided via discussion between their own group. Feminist and gender ideologies do not create parties, they are rarely have their own body of representatives. These radical liberal ideas just simply seep into wherever they can find traction, and those that want to make political power out of it just pick it up as a means to an end. In Europe a lot of places already have gender neutral kindergartens, and I am not so sure they were based on democratic will of the people. 

The only place where there is a genuine show of power from the gender ideology are the universities, which is quite troubling considering those are the people that will be considered the elite of the future. Which means US has a high chance of falling into a revolution not dissimilar to the Soviet revolution if the gender ideology wins, or, of course a far right uprising is just as likely as a reaction - but of course Peterson has already discussed this on an other episode."

》I was talking about this line of good and evil that runs down peoples hearts 
It's a terrible fault line, and it can be shocking to see that it's the case

So it's much more convenient for people, 
to divide the world into the righteous and the damned
And then to persecute the damned, well it's convenient too, because whatever resentment and hatred and bitterness you have in your heart, and you have plenty of that generally speaking, if you're a social justice type, because you regard yourself as oppressed. And that's a great starting point for resentment and hatred; to be a victim.

We know that one of the precursors to genocide, and I'm not saying at all that we are near that stade, but one of the precursors in a pregenocidal stade is the acceptance of victim status by the eventual perpetrators, 
cause the idea is like ""well we are innocent, we're being persecuted, and those people are going to get us"" so eventually that becomes ""Well we'll get them first"".

So you have a target for all you resentment and your hatred 
And it's a justifiable moral target 
So all the part of yourself that you don't recognise as contributing to what ever problem you think now pollutes the world;
you can ignore all that; 
YOU'RE on the side of the GOOD. There's no moral effort required.

And then you have someone to conveniently hate, and hint, 
and hurt 
And all the while you can look at yourself in the mirror and say :

""I'M on the side of the GOOD"""

Those are the things that’s weighing on your consciousness.
You know, “I should really do this”, but you don’t. 

So I had this idea long time ago because the world is a pretty dreadful place. 
I thought, well, what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew they should do? 
The questions is: 
How much are we contributing to the fact that life is an existential catastrophy and tragedy
How much is our own corruption contributing to that? 
The things you leave undone because your angry, resentful, lazy. 
You consult your consciousness – it says – “well that place over there could use a little work”. 
It’s the same as working on yourself and so you clean that up because you can. 
Then things are a little bit clearer around you. 
And you are a little better off because you practise a bit and, so you get a little stronger.
And something else manifests itself and says “maybe you could take a crack at fixing me to?” 
So, you decide to do that. 
Its humbling because you are not exceeding your domain of competence. 
Don’t be fixing up the economy, 18 year olds. 
You don’t know anything about the economy. It’s a massive complex machine beyond anyone’s understanding and you mess it at you peril. 
So, can you even clean up your own room?
You should think about that 
You should really thing about that. 

if you can’t even clean up your room, who the hell are you to give advice to the world?

I think some of the issues Peterson is trying to work out in the last year due to his situational surprise role were worked out by Ken Wilber, particularly the dignities and horrors of post modernism. It’s so nice to have another voice synthesizing and integrating different perspectives but also differentiating and dissolving the ideologies that serve to cloud and divide. The narcissistic half truths that people solely identify with so violently can be tricky to spot and even harder to witness, especially in ourselves. Peterson’s ability to passionately jam out truths in the moment with such accurate recall was something that Wilber excelled at in the 90s and early 00s."

1:44:30 - This is super important and every young person, in college or not, should really listen and reflect on this because it is everywhere.  Young people with no real world experience (you know who you are so be honest and leave your ego out of it), stop pretending like you know how to solve the world's problems.  Most of you can't even clean your own room and somehow you think you know how to fix the economy or the government or world hunger. I myself am in my late 20's and have been guilty of this. If this young internet generation would take this to heart there would be so much less hate and ignorance thrown around everywhere.  Just listen, read and learn from your experiences and then once you have some real world experience you can take a leading part in the discussion. Until then stop pretending like you know more than everyone else and especially stop spreading so much hate."

Ugwsz5tHLgvRaxvGUAF4AaABAg,Mario Basara,1514137657550,"He touched upon males in feminist movements as being unable to compete with competent males. I think the same goes for the females. Their approach to world and problems makes them undesirable to males and females since panic and confrontation with other social members are traits that are undesirable to adult competent people (same goes in reverse), and that puts them on lower levels of competition when it comes to other females. As Jordan said, females use males to climb the ladder, but if no male or female wants them on their side, that disables your abilty to compete and climb the social ladder. That causes the females that dont do well on the competitive scene to further use their undesirable traits and isolate themselves, while the males that cant compete with other males join them because thats the only way for them to feel accepted and get any mating rights with females. Other females are above their social ladder and choose competent males for relationships since that gives both of the partners a better chance at growing and advancing. Very interesting.

He contradicts himself endlessly. He is completely on the defensive, and just name-calls his critics rather than justifying any of his stances. And again the comment section is full of praise from the SQWs (Status Quo Warriors). Hey JP,  the reason nearly every professional academic criticizes you is not because they are all PoMo neo-Marxists, it's because you are an intellectual flat-earther, and don't understand modern critique, or the history of social movements, or how civilization is just trying to be more civil. Sorry dude, history changes things, society progresses. SQWs such as you and your followers can cling to your dinosaur culture, but the rest of us are moving on. And no one tries to debate you? are you serious? You just go on shows where the host head nods the whole time and says ya, totes, you're so right, everyone's crazy.

You can't as a man decide you wanna be a woman and then go beat the shit out of women in the UFC with your masculine physique. Also, it's not an option to be both genders or neither.

It makes no sense to protest what this man has to say. ""I have ZERO issue with trans individuals"" ....well you're homophobic...wtf. It's like the issue is becoming LESS about actual HUMAN RIGHTS and MORE about a fundamental misunderstanding as to what actually falls into the category of human rights. Someone referring to a person with the correct pronoun is not a fucking human rights issue. I refer to trans individuals with their preferred pro-noun. Not because it's a human rights issue, but because I respect them. You shouldn't be able to force someone to respect another person. I understand forcing someone not to discriminate, but the line between respect and discrimination is being blurred.

Did I just miss it or did you actually get a bit side tracked when the question of conspiracy and individuals behind this post modern movement was raised? Jordan spoke about it's history again but didn't bring up the possibility of a contemporary force at the top levels of this philosophy. I think it is probably unlikely that such individuals would be easily identifiable due to the gutlessness and cowardice that seems to be associated with it's higher level disciples, but the fact that this movement has gained so much momentum suggests that it is indeed being resourced by some very wealthy individuals and or companies. It has to be, otherwise it surely would have lost momentum and any force long ago due to the fact that it is so lacking in any cohesiveness and that it's followers are all so self absorbed that it seems impossible for it to have gotten this far?"

Ugzmz8rZT-P3Dw9gxDR4AaABAg,JustPast12,1511545700458,Nothing can last longer than truth. It will outlive any ideaology. When u can connect our behavior from the beginning of time until now then how can you plot a new course with no ties to that bridge. You can try to cut that cord but it will find its way back because it's at the core of human nature. That truth is a air bubble that will pop up no matter how far under water you push it. And the chaos is or could be the space between the bubbles furthest depth and the surface it will eventually come up to. So the deeper it goes and longer it stays there then the more people we will lose to the chaos. So maybe at its core religion is the not one path but our only path. Because it is the truth of our being. Like when the substitute teacher came to class when we were kids we got off on the chaos of no order. We knew order will be restored when the regular teacher came back but for a brief time we enjoyed going nuts. So when people say why do we need religion why not just be a good person I think that's like removing the teacher all together and forever and letting the kids invent what's order. So if u leave it at that then we can go 100 years or 10000 years and see where that gets us. And if enough time passes that truth will make its way back to the surface because that's all we know. Hard to put into words but I feel like I lm understanding what he's saying even if it's just the tip of the iceberg.

Judging by the comments it holds similar power with thousands of others, and that is pretty fuckin cool"
UgzBE89czjUEXqE5aKZ4AaABAg,RC Sutton,1511545711075,"He uses the words of Nietzshe as an authority in the matter of religion and literature of the christian faith. Unfortunately there is no such thing as an authority in regards to science and the understanding of human nature as we know it. He cherry picks the words of those he holds to be enlightened in regards to truth. What about Einstein, Hawking, Newton, and many other great minds. What about their understanding of the texts and the ethics they bring. Einstein said ""The word God is for me, nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change this."". That quote says exactly what Peterson is saying, but without the the confusing talking points (such as truth or functionality). Buddhism has some of the same teachings as christianity, does that mean that there is a gestalt mind. Not at all. Does it give evidence to a higher being (God). Not at all. Catholic saying ""the rational mind will fall in love with its own creations"" is held as truth or a better word fact. It isnt, nor does the statement include the complexities of the human intellect, it is a blanket statement of preditction (un-scientific and un-tested) that holds no truth. He talks about the actions of the Nazi regime 1939-1945, and forgets that Hitler was a religious fundamentalist of the christian faith (read Mein Kampf), same with those of the Spanish inquisition. Can you name a government run by secular (or those lacking religion) rationalists or intellectuals that have subjagated its people or murdered them? (if so, they probably committed the atrocities because they could rather than because they were rational) No, and stalin and Mao were both religious radicals in their intent to enact something they believed rather than what they knew to be fact (recklessness). So I like peterson, but this idea that there is more meaning to the literature of the christian faith, is naive and he is clearly reaching for reasons to justify his beliefs that contradict his rational mind. These arguments about the importance of religious text need to be convincing to the skeptics, and so far this is the least convincing argument with more semantics than explanation. whats the point in his semantics if the end result of his meanderings over biblical meanings leads to no emerging truth. He even meanders over the meaning of the word truth and breaks it into deeper meaning for no reason (truth= Wisdom + Fact bs). Truth is what you believe whether it be fact or fiction, fact is fact whether you believe it to be true or not. I will not discredit the guy, becuase he definitely knows how to create an argument that leads to critical thought, but the critical thought is the positive output of his arguments, not his emerging truth. Its like pointing to something that we do not yet understand giving it an explanation based on speculation, and convincing everyone that you hold some sort of deep understanding by simply knowing that indeed we know nothing of the subject. His conversation with Sam Harris was similar, it was semantics and giving words extra meaning without getting to the point. You can discuss the interpretations of a ancient text all you want, but there will always be no real need for the bible and its primitive parables that were relative only to the cultures at that time. Religion is a form of control, and his focus should be on why the people in the bible created such teachings. Sure it is something that is part of western culture, look at eastern culture, it is rich in ancient culture and religion, should we give their religious text extra meaning and possibly see it as some ancient wisdom? which one should we follow? both? or none? Maybe the things that it discusses is simple humanity and its many states? Either way, its something that we have figured out, we can get this knowledge from history rather than a collection of fairytales given to us from the immaginations of ancient desert dwellers (religion is a part of history, not history itself). His argument against any contradiction to his claim would be that the contradiction is post modernist in order to cop out of any actual explanation as to why the contradiction is rational. He is creating a complex argument over something that is pretty easy to understand. Did religion play a part in our culture? yes. Is religion useful in the future of our growing civilization? No. Its actually divisive in nature, and how is that beneficial to the human race? I do not disagree with all his arguments, just the one about the importance of the bible and religion."

The immense amount thinking I have always done about the nature of being human and existence of life has been sharpened and honed by him and my knowledge has increased 100 fold.

UgzFIlK3ztRWNeMJ3Q14AaABAg,James Farrell,1508867340266,"Seems to me he too easily discredits Marxist philosophy. He talks about Marx as if he was a cult. He equates Marx with social justice warriors. I don't understand that. And what's this hatred towards the post-modernists? Rorty's Ironism makes sense. He takes an easy target and runs with it. Would be good to see this truth merchant talk to someone who could give him a hard time. Identity politics is a problem, but that's exact;y why Marx and Rorty should be taken seriously. Has he even read Marx? I doubt it. I enjoy listening to him, but it's just a sermon without criticism. Talking about 'the other', wasn't Marxist philosophy based on mutual recognition and demystification of hierarchies? There are no heroes, and dominant males are pre-selected in many ways. It's like listening to someone that pretends to be curious, yet is very much stuck in the mud. Joe could at least play devil's advocate. He shit posts here, too. When is there not a state of chaos, and please tell me what is the 'truth'. He sounds like a man on acid that almost has a point but runs into nonsense. Back to Marx and class war, it was getting close to truth, but Rorty was truer when he said language or meaning just keeps changing. If his trans thing is a main point, it's weak, as we already know it daft. Tell us something we don't know."

Ugzaxq-o_dydSZg8UZN4AaABAg,Rois GlasSco,1508867345215,"It's more like 30% deadwood from a synaptic point of view. If it was 95% deadwood we would never develop a mind, or what Peterson calls a hierarchy, a word which originally referred to the high priest with his subservient classes and therefore a concept he may be misusing, since the brain and therefore society doesn't tend to exactly form itself in that way, even if it looks that way on the outside - although we certainly prioritise and categorise things. The story towards the end was told wrong - it's an Arabic tale of the scorpion and the turtle, not the frog (which he has decided represents trans people as opposed to simply adaptable people, which is a totally different thing). The turtle is attacked while swimming because of the nature of the scorpion to attack, but the turtle survives because it has a shell - very important difference. I don't want to say anything insulting about this guy but at certain points in the conversation the attraction between these two is almost homo-erotic, which is ironic given Peterson's outdated use of Freud. In particular I raised an eyebrow when I heard him theorising about why Joe is a great warrior intellectual and presumably he's playing the role of the priest or prophet, or mother perhaps if you want to go Oedipal. They are literally gazing into one another having mind sex at this point, in a velvet curtain lined boudoir, whispering compliments at each other. Freud is very useful in two areas that I'm aware of: Interpreting art (and he included religion in that category) i.e. works of the unconscious, and the behaviour of young children (possibly adults that have strong childish dendencies). When you listen to the videos he uploads about how he fell in love with his wife when he was seven years old and had this idyllic childhood in Alberta, it's not really surprising that he seems to want to understand the whole of society as smothering mother and kindly father figures, trying to tame the evil penis snake and save Hogwarts from the bearded lady frog. I can recall several of my professors had similar internal struggles when trying to relate to students that had very different lifestyles to them and subsequently they constantly bemoan the lack of quality thinkers 'these days' etc. despite the fact that results at some colleges are going up in serious and difficult subjects that cannot be faked by pretending to be Derrida inspired social critics. The truth is, its the interference of pseudo-hierarchies in the setting of curriculum that leads to some subjects developing redundant off-shoots, the abandonment of big generic departments that allow options within one course, rather than a business driven model of specialisation, that leads to students wondering why they should be bothered - certain courses have guaranteed job routes after study, the rest know that they are headed for another boring job unrelated to their interests, leading them to seek refuge in the manufactured anger of group-think identities. It's not their bedrooms they can't organise, it's the economy, on a local and wider level - and the phoney social democrat parties they join tell them it's just over the horizon, one more election away. To describe these self-harming individuals as closet Nazis just because they blow a horn and wear a stupid Marx T-shirt confirms to me that north americans have no idea what Fascism or Democracy is, practically speaking. The main problem that I see with Derrida for instance, apart from the fact that he's a wannabe Sartre with no real program, he's not easy to read because he is trying to deconstruct and redefine the use of language, but providing no assistance to the reader as to how they should read it, like trying to teach a child a new language with sounds that cannot be replicated and have no clear meaning. It's not language, it's more like interior decor made of words. It's like someone took the most difficult parts of Satre then fed them through google-translate and called it literature. A poor man's Burroughs. He pointed out valid problems with the academic system in some of his original criticisms and as an Algerian immigrant from a Jewish family in a country with a long history of antisemitism, understandably wasn't too keen on the idea of a dominant 'Western' philosophy - well some have tried to precisely define what that would be, like Harold Bloom and there efforts are laughable at times, despite the fact they continue to have great authority behind the scenes. The majority of higher education people I've come across are conservatives, not neo-marxists and they resist any kind of serious reform to the structure which decides what is curriculum and whats's not, so the fact that there are some pointless mental souffle subjects in there is ultimately irrelevant. Campus protests are like the educational equivelant of the welfare state - designed by centre-right liberals and phony social democrats to shut people up in terms of the economy.  People like Derrida and occupy protest movements blather on about democracy but provide no real method for achieving it. I'm not intimidated by unenforceable bullshit laws about pronouns, as badly written as they may be. I'm worried about what identity politics will morph into when the economies become even more elitist. Peterson's appeal to individual reflection cannot change the economy, just like prayer and reflection didn't save people from famine in the middle ages. Which is a shame, because he is probably quite a good therapist and good to talk to, like Terence McKenna without the drugs - he reminds me of my grandmother. Sorry, I mean Alpha male compassionate encouraging father archetype. He definitely needs to keep rereading Jung because I don't recognise his ideas on gender here - and actual cross-dresser would probably have a better idea of the use of gender as a symbol. Perhaps then Peterson might be able to draw his dragon like HR Giger and face it instead theorising about why it's frightening."

18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasionswith all kinds of prayers and requests.With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.""

He knows women marry up and across dominance heirarchies and men marry down and across generally speaking I don't know why he hasn't connected that to why men are more drawn to listening to things about responsibility and truth.

Those that ""Praise Kek"" do not wish for Trump to fail... we want him to prevail. Those that wish to MAGA are pro-Kek. ""Kek Wills It"" is said when truly great things happen in the world.

Kek is nothing more than a collective created symbol of great happenings. We channel our energies into Kek and the meme magic becomes too strong. Many people get woke.

Knowing Hillary is one that is very evil and powerful, she's clued in on secret facts of the universe. Hillary attacking ""Pepe the Frog"" as a racist symbol and with the left attacking Kekistan, it shows that they fear positive energies being channeled.

Why do we do anything? Service to others - but we rarely see it that way. 

Not one person is capable of doing everything. Individually we're essentially weak, stupid, and incapable compared to our collective abilities. That's why we need each other. We compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses and as a result we are better off. 

Money is just the medium of exchange. Without an actual thing/service to purchase, money is useless.

If automation and AI can continue some of the services we do for each other so that most of our basic needs are met, then we've accomplished something great. We've essentially created a self-sustaining system for ourselves.

On the other hand, lions in zoos become incapable of hunting in the wild. They lose their hunting skills, intuition, and become lazy.

Depending on the choices we make, we can either become less capable, like zoo lions, or collectively better ourselves significantly."

""And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""-John 8:32-

Whether you're a person of faith, or purely secular, that verse resonates.. Also Dr. Peterson spoke the truth when he said that we each of us see ourselves often through a veil of self deception. That's a very difficult thing to overcome, brutal honesty, self criticism is extremely hard to get right. So often this is when you depend on the honesty of friends, loved ones to keep you centered.. grounded on both feet.

I worked a manual job for 30 years after my Discharge.. and often alone, each of us in our own place away from the others, a lot of time to think.. I had several moments I'd call Epiphanies.. life changing moments of self revelation.. a couple in service, when I discovered just how mortal I was, how easy it is to be alive one minute, and very dead the next. I was lucky.. not a superhero, just stone cold lucky..

Then injuries,.. broken spine in 91.. crushed four vertebrae from a fall onto concrete at work.. then again 04,.. . hit by an SUV in a parking lot at work.. crushed 7 vertebrae that time, 8 discs. I can walk, and at first I seemed to heal alright, but as the years go by.. the arthritis, bone growth deteriorating discs, arterial disease.. walking now is short and difficult as all Hell.. pain, rapidly escalating pain that never goes away completely..

so.. a glimpse of mortality, your own.. and long hours in the night where you discover just how much you can endure.. discovering how to find that place where you can compartmentalize the pain.. lock it away.. separate, always there, but not in control of you anymore..

It's kind of like what Dr. Peterson said.. burning away the debris.. the dead wood..

I'd compare it to being dipped in acid, in the end you only have your own limits, see them clearly. No banter, no smack talk, you see inside yourself what you really don't like. The things you'd change.

Then you start to work on it, a forever a work in progress.. remaking your own internal self to reflect how you want to be.. not what you see now.. what you should be.

I know.. a long winded bastard.. TL;DR.. 

just saying what the Dr. said really reaches me on a personal level.. some I discovered myself.. the rest he gifted me.. 

Thanks Dr. Peterson.. Thank You."

The changes most commonly beneficial to SJW and another parties  I observed are definitely in the realm of the internet considering restricting free speech and advancing mass scale monitoring on people's privacy disguised as a ""Security"" case. 
The other parties of course being corporations that don't want authentic reviews on their products and governments justifying spy work on the masses. SJWs are getting powerful support by mainstream everything. Even Michio Kaku to an extent is leftist with his ""Type 1 society"" bullshit.

UgzELgRQxOLxXmWhXDZ4AaABAg,Phillip Adams,1503597023713,"Thank God that there is a brilliant guy in Toronto with the balls to say these things. I wanted to add that in many cultures from all over the world and of different time periods, the men are almost always leading. In one Indian culture the ""shaman"" explains that women are energetically configured to be more changing and able to be swayed. Kind of like how they have powerful cycles that really effect their lives. Men see what women are experimenting with or looking around at, and help them set a fixed course. Thus the necessity of MEN AND WOMEN as a sacred union. In Kabbalah, demons or shadow forces are said to take whatever God has created and corrupt it because they do not have that ""light"" so all they can do is mess with the purest form of creation. Im sure thats not perfect but it's something pretty close to what they teach. So we could look at all of this stuff as a perversion of the principle of natural gender that has definitely already caused some death and chaos. Powerful J Peterson."

UgxLUo7ZhDp1pla4rU94AaABAg,AminCad,1503597075235,"At 2:35:00 Joe Rogan promotes universal basic income, aka universal welfare. He's a very intelligent and thoughtful guy, so I thought I'd share why this is a bad idea, in the hopes that him and his supporters could see this:

1. First of all, it rests on a misunderstanding of how cheap automation affects the value of labour. What actually happens is that those things that are easily automated become commodified, and this in turn increases the amount spent on those things that are hardest to produce, because they are not automatable.  

That's why automation has increased wages over the last 200 years.

There were far more things that humans could do that machines could not 200 years ago, relative to today, yet wages are growing faster today. 

2. Large-scale social programs are massively expensive. The only way to fund them is to impose a tax on private transactions, like a tax on sales or income. Taxing income requires a law demanding that a person disclose personal information on all of their private income to the government. Anyone who refuses to surrender their privacy and disclose this extremely personal information faces the potential punishment of being thrown in prison, where they are kept in a small enclosure, and where they often develop mental illness, and suffer from physical and sexual abuse. This is overt mass-surveillance enforced through threats of incarceration.

Then, once a person has disclosed this personal information under threat of imprisonment, a tax on income requires demanding that people hand over a share of this currency that they've received in private trade. This tax debt is unlike other types of debt. It's a debt obligation that a person assumes without their consent."

UgwrhJeaxyH6A_2qFP94AaABAg,zedooncadhz,1503597075260,"I was with a three year old the other day and they didnt really understand what the difference between a boy and a girl was.  They just said someone with long hair was a girl. Kids dont really understand, its true society teaches them, because kids dont know fucking anything and so they have to learn everything. But it's a fact that there are two genders. Humans are sexually dimorphic meaning men and women are physically different to each other. Not teaching a child that there are men and women is just purposefully disorientating for them. The world's already confusing enough. Just teach them acceptance and let them get on with life. 
This idea of ""gender assignment"" is autonomous, it happens without a direct concerted effort of any kind of organisation in order for its effect to be achieved. The fact there has to be a direct concerted effort of a group of people to change how people think should probably be a sign that something is wrong. 
In Germany you see lots and lots of women with short hair who wear practical clothing and either don't flaunt any curves or just generally look healthy without having a particularly hour glass physique. I see that as a gender neutral society. They've gone in the direction that the extreme left seem to bang on about and demand but without going completely fucking over board. Everyone's just human beings. That's all we need to achieve. If we can all see each other as human beings rather than fuck objects or symbols of hate or obstacles but human beings that almost certainly have most the same feelings as each other but have just gone down different paths in life but also have fundamental differences then we'll be fine. It just seems fucking impossible for everyone to do that though. Other people end up becoming ""the others"" depending on their belief. It's so tribal and primitive to need to create an enemy just so that you can belong to a tribe. Notice in life that weak people gravitate towards hateful gangs because an easy way to create a tribal bond is to share a common enemy."

Academics often cannot reduce their self inflation to the point of realizing that they have been taken in on all levels and are only biting at the wind of change and deception. He is obviously not a Christian but maybe believes in the god of the collective conciousness. He has probably been taken in by the usual evolutionary blather coupled with the ""Origin of Conciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" and is reflexively deriving his morality from Western Civilization's historical affair with true Christianity.

The exclusion of transcendant morality makes it impossible to draw the line of good and evil through the individual human heart, leaving only humanity itself to be divided - hence demonisation, purges, gulags and mass executions.
This is where the protesters' cold fish eye looks come from - the protesters no longer see opponents as human beings, but as evil itself that must be silenced and eliminated; they are using the blunt force of law as their weapon to that end for the moment, sharper tools will follow."

Then it turns out he's selling some sort of self-help bollocks, and that was it.  At that point he came off as some sort of charlatan or con-man, or god knows what.

The way the Koreans are involved in this is that they are huge in the gaming and esports scene. The game this comes from is World of Warcraft. When an Alliance player sees something that a member of the opposing faction says (they're called ""Horde"") it get's jumbled up to look like giberish. This is so that players from opposing factions can't communicate and coordinate with one another. It just so happens that when a Horde player says ""lol"" the Alliance player sees ""kek"".

A lot of people wouldn't have done that...many people would have thought, ""Oh boy! Now we get to talk about ME! I got a free pass to talk all about why people love me and why I'm cool!"".

So instead they'd use silica beads to immobilize the zyklon, which wasn't a gas at room temperature, it was a volatile liquid (think acetone) so they could pump out the zyklon in small manageable but still deadly quantities, and then sweep up the beads, wearing some kind of gas gear, and do it all over again, without having to spend shitloads of money to kill of everyone and alert the bean counters. I think this explanation might be a way for the accountants and other people who were happy to look the other way to get off scott free with no guilt, but apparently there's some evidence behind this though I cannot provide it.

Not too long ago it used to be Christian values, and even after that it was Enlightenment values based on a blend of scientific truth and Christian values. Now, in the era of relativist humanism (postmodernism) what cause is worth dying for? It is interesting to note at this point that Fascism in various forms has been voted for by majorities, whereas ""Bolshevism"" (meaning majority in Russian) has never been willingly assumed by the people of a nation- it has always been forcibly asserted. Some majorities some of the time, in some places willingly opt for Fascism, no majority at any place or time has willingly opted for Communism.

UghsoLH6hrU1XXgCoAEC,HighFunk Aspy,1503597131589,"So what is the obstacle, considering all the ""metaphorical"" truths and congruency with the human condition, from making the jump from metaphorical interpretation of the logos in biblical narrative as just some transcendent organising principle invented by man upon which everything seems to supervene -  to a literal interpretation? 
From the way they're speaking t's like seeing the most incredible painting that surpasses everything else known, while understanding the effect it has on people/culture, appreciating all the relevant metaphorical meaning behind the symbolic representations - THEN pretending to each other that the painting is just the works of billions of ants crawling across a canvas in precisely the right way, after each individually steps across the just correct colour of paint, over the span of millions and millions of years and preferring THAT miracle - rather than attributing it to someone's mind of incomprehensible complexity, simply because of how difficult it is for us to imagine anything painting something this incredible. Difficulty to imagine something is not indicative of that something not being true or real - its just indicative of how limited our conceptual ability to imagine is. 

Boiling it down to a myth''s operation on human's psychology seems to be an incomplete explanation, given all the effects and the central importance to humanity it has had throughout history,as Peterson has stated. It's too simplistic a mechanism to explain all the effects it has had all on the world. 

That's like saying water boils in a kettle due to fire increasing the kinetic energy between molecules to the point where their intermolecular bonds break allowing it change phase from liquid to gas and thats it - while leaving out that somebody had to place the water in some container and place it on a sufficient source of heat with the intent for it to do so. The first half is a true but incomplete explanation - leaving out the most crucial aspect to the whole shebang: agency. Agency is only possible, terrestrially, with minds. 

If this logos is functionally apparent and metaphysically real, thus as a consequent, tangible in an indirect way right here and now; and manifests itself in the world through people resulting in western civilisation - why would one just assume that this logos is just an organising principle like E=MC^2 , which empties and voids it of any moral content and meaning by describing it that way?  
If some organising principle is able to be discerned in reality and is itself a cause of the ability to discern inherent within us AND is built into the patterns or regularities of the world and everything within it, able to exert actual effects on reality comprehensible to our  minds in such a way that it must communicate its own existence through language and stories - why not recognise or describe it as something closer to what we would, in human terms, call a MIND? 

A supernatural mind from which the order and moral structure of the universe is derivative. 

You don't need a story to communicate the meaning of a principle that is nothing more than a abstract functioning mechanistic description of some phenomena. You need a story and narrative to communicate things of much deeper metaphysical significance and THAT is something maybe either Peterson leaves out or has missed. 

And if this logos is more like a mind rather than simply an impersonal over-arching principle with immense utility, as its pervasiveness is evident in all aspects of reality, and that the world is already naturally manifesting its essence whether one believes in it or not - why is it unlikely that this logos actually manifests itself AS an actual human-being in Jesus Christ? 

Just because I find it impossible to imagine using my existing schemas based on limited knowledge and understanding of the universe?

What are the reasons to simply assume that this logos is not ""conscious"", for lack of better description, like us? But a type of consciousness that is so far beyond our own we can't even being to comprehend it and back away in fear and trepidation at any inkling that it might just be so? 

And why just this ""myth""? Why not any other ""myth""? Why was western civilisation not built on the mesopotamian god mentioned but on this ""myth"" of Christ instead if they are so similar? Where is the divine text of this many-eyed god who battles tiamet if it is equally valuable and why didn't people record, collate and disseminate it the same way they did the Bible? 
How did all the books written by different people throughout different time periods, even if compiled by a human committee, maintain such consistency with one another if the authors themselves had no contact at all with each other unless there was something else at play here? 

I can't take a chapter from John Grisham and mash it in with a chapter of JK Rowling and then a chapter from Sam Harris and another chapter from Deepack Chopra with my buddies and end up with anything other than a compilation of texts that have no relevance to one another in the least, let alone providing such significance or impact in the real world. 

So how did this book come to be the way that it is, have the impact that it has had - and why should one only take the metaphorical route? 

It seems like the ultimate pride, at least pride in the capacity of humans, to attribute it completely to just human imagination and invention purely for some moral function. 

Why is it so difficult for us people to even entertain the possibility that Christ literally is this logos manifest in flesh, who in taking on human-form was actually able to be perfect whilst nobody else could because nobody knew the logos as well as the logos knew itself, to be able to embody it completely in mind, speech and action - thus bridging the gap between man and God 
 - as it is claimed?  

Do we also discount the 100's of million if not in the billions of people in the last 2000 years who experience the supernatural and miracles as just crazy people with faulty neurological wirings or just somehow working in concert throughout millennia to just lie about it to play some trick on us? What gives me the right to disregard someone else's experience as less real than mine, just because I haven't had the same experience as they? 

That's like if I was born bind, and told you that the sky can't be blue because I can neither see it nor imagine it. 

So maybe this faith people speak of is not blind but making the conceptual leap from the metaphorical to the literal - in light of the fact that there is evidence for the literal in history and archaeology, along with little reason not to at least entertain the possibility, other than some a priori allegiance to naturalism - despite increasing unlikelihood that naturalism is true and its decreasing explanatory capacity as both science and philosophy begins to understand and discover the incredible depth and complexity of reality. For example, the impasses in philosophy of mind to reduce consciousness into the physical entirely  (Nagel, Jackson, Block Raffman) is a strong case as to why naturalism or materialism is an incomplete picture of the totality of being. 

What if the Christians were right about everything all along and its our own ego, our lack of conceptual ability and unwillingness or fear to contemplate the possibility that inhibits us from seeing the ultimate truth embodied within this book?"

UggrAw3mIizy3HgCoAEC,MrJohnny56789,1503597162187,"women wear high heels, makeup, lipstick ,to get male attention and be seen as attractive. Men get a good job, fancy clothes, and say the right things politically to be seen as attractive. A woman is a being, a man is a doing .Therefore, I don't think you should shame men who act like a feminist to get female attention. For one, they may be doing it merely to fit in and be 'on the right side', because they want to be the good guys, irrespective of pussy dropping their way or not. Secondly, all men have to 'change themselves' to become attractive.

That's actually the #1 most common advice towards men: if a woman doesn't like you, change yourself so you're a 'better person'. These men Peterson is calling 'creepy' are doing exactly what society is telling them to do; ""change yourself so you're acceptable"".

A man who chooses to be a bum doesn't get laid. A man who works a shitty job and has no 'ambition' doesnt get laid. Why? Because women want a man who is a 'doing', going somehwere or becoming something that is 'desirable'.

These men in these crowds are no different, and I think what's happening here is Peterson is shaming them because he sees the cult iotself with disgust, and therefore is highly disgusted with males who are disenfranchised and trying to become ""the good guy"" by any means necessary in order that women will like them.

You can call it pathetic, and it is, just as pathetic as men working themselves into the grave or working hard to get high powered jobs in order to be seen as sexually desirable. All those things are 'pathetic' too, if the only intent is to be liked. 

But that's what everyone does. Because if you're 'yourself', and you feel under attack by society or women don't like you, then you have to 'change yourself' to be a 'better man'.

Society tells us to do this and reinforces it constantly. And these men-turned-feminist are adhering to that. And you're basically kicking those males when they're down by calling them creeps. That's cool."

Odd that Peterson separated those two things, given that he seems to view Christianity as a truthful dogma. If the Western Enlightenment values (rationalism, empiricism, etc.) viable means of determining what is true and what's not (insofar as we can tell), it's hypocritical for Peterson to claim that his religion is truthful because he can see it as viable through a completely arbitrary method separate from rationalism, empiricism, etc. Religion is the only subject Peterson's thinking is flawed on."

That's exactly right,.It already exists now with people that are on welfare. There are lots of people that have the option to do things but don't know what it is they wanna do. People are going to do nothing while they search for their purpose. He is so right when he says men compete. Competing , self improvement is ingrained  into us and if what we're doing isn't fulfilling that , it depresses us. because we aren't following our biological, psychological narrative that gives us a sense of meaning and purpose in our life. So we search for a way to fill this narrative that is so important to us be it like rogan's friend doing that in a video game, competing , becoming the best. It's just trying to enact the story that we need because he feels he can't do it in the real world. All you have to do is look at the real world and you're dwarfed. What do I wanna do? What is important to me? how can i compete and succeed in this world doing something I wanna do if I don't know what I wanna do.

Do you really believe that the US Constitution protects the rights of people in Somalia or Iraq? For most of American history, Courts for two centuries have held that constitutional rights do not apply to foreigners (non US citizens) outside the United States. Even residents of U.S. territories beyond the mainland do not enjoy all of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution (but can expect to be protected by the most fundamental guarantees). Joe, you're a very smart guy. That's why it drives me crazy that you are so ignorant on the subject of immigration. Read the law yourself and take a look at Presidential Powers. Obama instituted a temporary travel ban on Iraq. *Have Ann Coulter on the show*, it will make you smarter and get great ratings. If you think Ann is Evil, keep an open mind and do some research of your own. The Ann Coulter of 2004 is not the Ann Coulter of 2017, she's grown and evolved over the years like everyone else. She's not evil, she's controversial. Don't listen to what other's say about her, go directly to her and find out for yourself. She's actually got some liberal views, it's just hard to see because they've moved the goalpost so far in terms of what it means to be liberal. This is the central issue of the 2016 election, it deserves your time and attention. Your audience deserves to hear an honest conversation about it. Educate yourself Joe and your audience on this issue. Grow a dick and have Ann on. It gets people mad at you, that's assurance that you're doing the right thing. In times of chaos the best thing you can do is tell the truth. What is that Joe? Does Ann Coulter have anything of value to add to the immigration debate? Should we write off the millions of immigrations voters as stupid or misinformed? Remember when Ann was denied the right to speak at Berkeley University? They had a pro-immigration speaker on before Ann for both sides of the debate, but Berkeley never got the other side. Why don't you set an example for liberals and let Ann have her say?
PS I believe your belief in globalization is rooted in your belief of evolution. So, ask yourself this... *Is it wise to force evolution?* If the world is not ready for it, what will be the consequences of forced evolution or globalization?  Is the world ready for that?

UggTgKKgUp5HwHgCoAEC,Overwelmdn underated,1503597279530,"1:29:44 male feminists aren't sneaky - they believe women should have equal rights. Anyone who believes they should get special privileges, however, is something else entirely.  I would call them ""trans symbiotes"" because they latch on to the other power hierarchy much like a parasite, but they provide value, so a symbiote is more accurate. 

I have marched for gay rights, and consider myself trans (a gender I invented called EvoMonkey), but what Peterson is facing has less to do with gender than it does with tribal human nature and identity politics driven by tactical atomization from the deep state, top down. 

I think Peterson should also expound upon geogrpahic hegemony over resources, and looking at what ""seizing resources"" means in modern terms... this is often in the form of political capital, or ""victim status"" which is equivalent to political capital; or even legislative power (Bill C-16).  Out-group aggression is about more than eliminating threats, but securing resources and competitive advantages over genetic stakeholders."
UgjS_YJYJHTSI3gCoAEC,Overwelmdn underated,1503597279535,"at 1:28:49 Prof Peterson says that ""telling the truth is the best way to climb the dominance hierarchy."" But that's not true at all, and he's overlooking deception as an evolutionarily stable strategy.  Just looking at the stratification of wealth, one can easily see greater degrees of information asymmetry and deception at the absolute highest levels of the hierarchy.. but this is nothing new - deception is a form of coercion, a form of mental violence.  Pick any of 1000 modern examples of liars seizing power.. Trump, Clinton.. oftentimes what makes the victor is who lies best and in what amounts and how well fortified against scrutiny, i.e. the INFORMATION DOMINANCE HIERARCHY."

Having given this careful consideration both prior to and subsequent to watching this interview, I find I don't need very many words to respond to his objection toward the methods of people like me, or, say, The Amazing Atheist. That is to say, I am an outspoken atheist of the sort who mocks both religion and its adherents.

If I were regularly faced by opponents of the caliber of Dr. Peterson, I would immediately change both my tone and my methods. I do have objections to theism that are nuanced and sophisticated and of the sort that presumably Dr. Peterson would welcome in any discussion. 

I just find that I rarely have to reveal my big guns, because the small calibers will work just fine against the sorts of idiots I'm regularly faced with. Indeed, these idiots are the entire problem and the very reason for my outspokenness, my methods, my arguments, and my manner.

I'd love to be faced with the likes of Aquinas on a regular basis, and to grapple with the deep subjects of life. But the vast majority of religious adherents do not fall into this category. They betray the base level of their thinking with every word that escapes their bloviating neckholes. And to a large extent, one could argue that it is not religion at all but this pious and happy ignorance that I am responding to."

Why men more than women? I'm in the 98.5 percentile for intelligence, smarter than almost everyone I meet, definitely smarter than every teacher I've had. In kindergarten I was board in reading group so I answered all the questions half way through the asking, the teacher got mad, did she move me to more advanced class? Put me in grade one? No, she put me with the ""slow"" kids. Punished me for being smart. School taught me to sit still and move at the speed of the slowest kid in class. Is it any wonder I have no motivation? Combine this with our mass produced, throw it away, buy new one, never fix anything culture and everything men do, explore, create, and fix, is gone.

You don't get Mozart without hothousing your kid with 2hrs of piano, 2hrs of sight reading, 2hrs of listening, everyday. Somehow society got the idea that tool pushers are dumb because they work for companies that are created and destroyed by bean counters who mistake money for morality and capitalism uses bank accounts to keep score rather then how many live to you improve by building that damn or water treatment plant to last 1000 years.

Society asks nothing of men and when they try to do more puts obstacles of indifference and derision in their way. The only people who rise to the top in that environment are those who are obsequious sheep or score high in psychopathy.

UgiNIJE8HvIzEHgCoAEC,Andrew Carroll,1503597292614,"It is completely wrong what happened to JP at that rally, but even so I have to assert that he fundamentally misunderstands Derrida. Yes, the forces of Postmodernism are - at the extreme - nihilistic (and maybe worse). That said, even though Derrida's position may have begun as Marxist,  after a major life crisis early in his youth, he noticably evolved each position he took at one juncture in his development during the next 'chapter' of his ideas, and this evolution involved incorporation of the former idea's other. Thus, yes, Derrida may have been a Postmodernist during the 1970s, but soon became - necessary to the basic insight that underpins ALL of his important writing, an insight that is ""not a concept"" - a 'metamodernist', in a sense: let us remember that Postmodernism finds traction as a set of concepts only in relation to Modernism. JP, please do not mistake the Derrida of the 1970s for the Derrida of the 1990s, for example - one could only have dreamt of the other, because Derrida's insight takes that which was previously 'unconscious' in  and other to the deciding concept, and shows that it exists within the concept. When the ""outside"" (as Derrida calls it) is incorporated into a concept, an evolution of the concept takes place which honours both the position of the concept and that of its other. Derrida's position was that this paradox can take place only at each moment of decision, and thus the synthesis could not hold 'forever', but only for the current situation which requires decision. Life happens, and deconstruction of an idea is already at work within the idea."

Kek is derived from the purposeful misspelling of a common acronym LEL, which is derived from LOL which means Laughing out Loud, so it is effectively two levels of deviation away from that original LOL acronym. Other well known deviations are LOLZ, LELZ, LULZ, LUL, LEWL, etc. 

Another example is the abbreviation of the word ""please"", shortened to PLZ, and further deviations like PLEZ, PLX (a misspelling of the acronym PLZ by accidentally hitting the X key rather than the Z key on the keyboard), then for some reason PLOX, or PL0X, all of which represent that same word, ""please"". 

So effectively, the country of Kekistan literally means LOListan, and has become a parody of itself in many ways, as seen in the Pepe the frog memes, and has now reached ultimate heights of the mainstream media, and often villified due to the imagery displayed by some internet shitlords who sit in their basement all day, fingers dusted with cheetos cheese, combining already relevant and well known memes with that of hatred and bigotry, such as Pepe the frog wearing a Nazi uniform, or the Kekistan flag, which resembles a Nazi flag. 

This imagery is mostly used to gain the attention of the media, not to further the message of hatred, but to point out the stupidity of the news media, that they could take something so out of context by adding their own assumptions about these memes that people will actually buy into those assumptions and try to desecrate the original intent of the memes."

UghzpJOa1V9tGHgCoAEC,thesoundofthings,1503597316606,"Actual postmodern philosophy scholar here. While I truly sympathize with Dr. Peterson’s views and abhor his ridiculous predicament, I must disagree with his characterization of the postmodern “agenda"" (if it can even be called that) and its relation to these vocal groups he faces. Dr. Peterson makes postmodernity sound so focused, as though there was some postmodern manifesto in Derrida’s desk drawer that demanded constant heckling, zero communication, and gender unicorns(?). There wasn’t. Peterson is wrongly identifying his opposition with postmodernity, and neglecting just how postmodern he is himself being in all this. What the gender activist are doing is not a direct functioning of postmodernity, but a bad interpretation of it. These groups have co-opted deconstructive methodology, the postmodern attempt to dissassemble underlying philosophical assumptions persisting in any ideological framework - as such, postmodern methodology is the place where “ideology"" got its bad rap (possibly inherited from Marxism, as well). It is important to note that deconstruction has always been just as much a self-reflexive as external-directed exercise. What that means is that whatever confidence one loses in hierarchical power dynamics, this is just as much the case when it comes to confidence in one’s own responsibility in relation to that power. So while deconstructive processes work really well at detecting locations of power (internal and external) in functional ideological assumptions, it doesn’t offer specifics about (re)constructive responses. How could it? Otherwise it’d just be advancing yet another ideological agenda which it cannot trust itself to formulate! Somehow, that task fell to the current inheritors of postmodernity (the post-postmoderns?). They have benefitted from the inheritance of a long-standing unfolding of intellectual liberation from rigidly codified religious and metaphysical agendas, in which actually persistent ideological “oppressions”, largely understood through binary relations (proletariate/bourgouisie, God/human, body/mind, self/world, man/women, self/other, power/powerless, sin/piety) existed as unexamined and unquestioned conventions. This was what postmodernity originally set out to deconstruct - haphazardly? yes. - ideologically? absolutely unquestionably not! Meanwhile, subsequent thinkers broke-off chunks of the deconstructive method that served their own ideologies - post-colonial, critical race, gender theory. Mind you, originally, these were not ill-intended; they were questioning long-standing presumptions and hegemonies. But the results have exceedingly lost sight of the emphasis on self-interpretation. There is a hypocritical situation built in to the process: the performance of the deconstructive process results in the universalization of individual interpretations. If I want to express my interpretation of history as a domination of chocolate over other, equally viable bean products, this can be produced as a universalizable unfolding. To postmoderns, it’s valid, but not because it is inherently “true” but because your right to understand your world with whatever interpretation is unquestionable. BUT, the individual does its interpretive reconstruction in a public forum (academic papers and books, creative writings and performances, etc.). These revisionist histories ruled the day as ways of reinterpreting the unfolding of history through a particular lens (race, colonization, gender performativity). Likewise, the persistent reductions that both sides profess, “it’s all post-modernity’s fault,” or, “it’s all a consequence of heterosexist normativity,” are actually perpetuating the bad side of the deconstructive method, but only Peterson exhibits the good, which is “you are entitled to your interpretation, and it is valid, but I cannot be made subject to it"" . . . The obvious problem is that these interpretations are being legislated for others. Hence, why I agree with Dr. Peterson. The opposition is unjustifiably reacting to the percieved threat of their right to self-interpret experiences, but this is pre-emptive of any real threat to their opportunity to do so, and with the aim to hypocritically legistlate interpretations for others. Like Peterson says, why does he have to give ground regarding what the words he uses have to mean according to someone else’s agenda? So, technically, Peterson is more postmodern than the gender activists because he conceeds the rights of others to self identify and interpret their realities, but refuses to allow their interpretations to be forceably legislated upon his own experience."

This is simply an opinion, an assertion, and what ""works for him"",  It does not actually logically follow from what came before it.

He said that the serpent isn't mentioned as Satan in the Bible and that the correlation is made up. That's not true and he should know this if teaching on Genesis. This comes from the book of Revelation.

Revelation 12:9
And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

Revelation 20:2
And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.

Snakes are also mentioned all over ancient near eastern texts as symbols of the ultimate evil."

Ugh3WApjsfYGGXgCoAEC,"Like it, Love it or Lose it?",1503597397935,"With respect to all perspectives... From a Christian point of view... Both the New Testament and Old Testament point to days like we're living in now. I use the term ""End Days"" with the understanding (in my faith and per scripture) that not even Jesus (the Son) knows the time of HIs return - only God, the Father does. One could argue that pretty much any generation could site examples to what is described in the Holy Bible as end days. And that's true. Compared to 'eternity' - all days prior to, are the 'end days'... I humbly submit, too, that even those who don't believe in God - much less Jesus Christ... you have to concede that both Timothy and Isaiah, way back when writing these scriptures - were pretty much on point. In any case - I appreciate the chance to express my opinion/faith... Thank You, love the podcast. 

Any translation says the same... No preference on this end, in regards to this posting..... 2 Timothy 3:2-4 - People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. (NIV) / Isaiah 5:20 - They say that what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right; that black is white and white is black; bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter. (The Living Bible)

As far as some kind of push towards various agendas, like gender issues, etc... It's hard as Christians, at times, to remember that people, in general, aren't the enemy at all... Sin and the powers that rule and serve evil are.... Ephesians 6:12 - For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. (NIV) -- God Bless"

I'm neither anxious, nor hurting, and I find life ultimately meaningless, because it is.  It is merely an intellectual conclusion, and nothing more.  My life has been good with no more ups and downs than anyone else.  Four heart attacks, a couple spinal surgeries, and an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nerves might be considered by some to have been rough, but I don't dwell on these things because I'm just a lot more resilient than most, but to imply the conclusion that life is meaningless means that person is hurting or anxious is dead wrong.  I made the statement initially some 30 years ago well before I had any of these minor obstacles to life that many people lucky enough to live into their 50's have had to deal with.  Never hurting or anxious at in that time, or since.  Now being pissed off is a whole 'nother story, but that's just because in life you are surrounded by average people (idiots) who are constantly slowing you down and fucking things up, but don't confuse anger with anxiety, nor frustration with hurting.

Ughm9ZoqSNpGUngCoAEC,Jeff Stanley,1503597411464,"The truth is, Peterson is way too sanguine. Optimistic for no good reason, that is. 

The Underworld is not avoidable, it is inevitable. Consider, at random, one of the finely-cut Crown Jewels of Creation which has done well. From the bounty of abilities it was born with, it has conceived plenteous dreams and hopes and plans. And through much toil it has been fruitful, in love, in achievements, in truth. Yet in the end, the only nod to order it leaves behind is the reuse of its atoms by nature through the carbon cycle.

A rotting corpse, that’s what I’m talking about. That's you. Me too. Peterson as well.

""The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.""

Thus says the Preacher.

Nothing lasts forever, and it doesn’t matter whether realizing that nothing lasts forever helps or hurts. It doesn't matter that suffering matters either. Nor that it feels better to act like there is hope in the face of hopelessness. Chaos wins. That's what is going to happen, extinction, individually and eventually collectively.

Or that’s what she thought, at least, standing there wondering if the gardener had taken him somewhere..."

I don't know how Dr. Peterson spells this Kek, could be Keck or whatever. But i found his red line being a bit too thin to grab when he came to that argument.

Further - the ""Pepe the frog"" being symbol for that ""army of chaos"" etc, A quick search at ""know your meme"" homepage quickly gave this suggestion: ""Pepe the Frog is an anthropomorphic frog character from the comic series Boy’s Club by Matt Furie.""

UghrUz-8R-VD7XgCoAEC,Bee Dee Bee,1503597429819,"Rogan is extremely open minded. His biggest problem comes from falling in too deep with some very convincing people. I love Dr. Peterson though. On an unrelated note, I have been trying to figure out the LGBT thing for over a decade. In my opinion trannies are men who are diametrically opposed to the modern (or I would say post modern) representation of femininity. Like columbine shooters they came to an extreme conclusion, instead of arguing the point they ""take matters into their own hands"". They become the woman that they feel the female sex no longer represents. I think the gay community is a response to two things, the first being broken homes and the second being a natural biological reaction to overpopulation. Saying this is an abnormality is not saying that it is a bad thing, and should not be confused with abhorrent; which is what Bolshevik Marxism is: Abhorrent.

On a similar note to transexuals feelings toward femininity the columbine shooters believed that the system was broken, corrupt and evil.. so their twisted logic brought them to the conclusion that the school must be destroyed for the sake of mankind. Again, they are acting on impulse, taking matters into their own hands. My guess is that medication plays a large roll in this with the loss of impulse control in the defining years of childs life at the point in which their brain is physiologically growing.  We should be thankful that trannies don't turn out as lone wolves, the markers are all there.  Social ostracization, mental and physical abuse they endure is very similar, the proclivity for low impulse control and the will to act on their beliefs is also very similar.

 Along with medication, I think open mindedness plays a large roll in the difference between the two. I think that the problems that both face are due to the deterioration of our fundamental values as a society, and this ties back to post-modernist bonds with Marxism. This is, of course (on youtube), conjecture, but in my humble opinion /pol/ is always right."

UggaL2XQsdOmgXgCoAEC,Capt. Fail,1503597438908,"I usually enjoy listening to anything Peterson says, as he's brilliant and articulate, but I just hate when he starts his religious rants. It's his one blind spot. He argues for an objective truth but says that we developed it over time... as if those two things aren't in contradiction with each other! His truth consists of just the things that seem to have worked for a few centuries, and just the things that have worked FOR HIM, with his point of view. Obviously Islam is not part of his objective truth yet it's worked for the male dictators in Islamic countries for quite some time. 

Not only that, but if this truth is to be developing, some part of it is CURRENTLY WRONG. Not only is that contrary to what an objective truth is, but the parts he fights for could be what need to be replaced!
Peterson, to me, seems like an atheist who is unwilling to accept the fact that he should espouse nihilism, and he's constructed this elaborated explanation to neither accept a religious view nor nihilism that still gives him some truth. If you look hard enough, though, he hasn't created anything of the sort. It should still fall to nihilism."

Ugi-uqUnItueI3gCoAEC,postmoderncory,1503597469583,"I find a lot that's really admirable about Jordan Peterson. He clearly is a brave man and a profound intellect who has taken upon himself the defense of humanist values against a frighteningly irrational and illiberal onslaught by a new breed of radical. 

That being said, Peterson's discussion of Marxism comes across as uninformed, or at least self-serving. Marxism is an old and diverse intellectual tradition that has produced both extremely valuable insights and totalitarian garbage of the type Peterson alludes to. While it's easy to tar it all with the brush of the dictatorial horror of the Soviet Union and communist China, the truth is that Marxism and other socialist schools of thought have inspired Western labor movements, as well as calls for social reforms like minimum wage laws and restraints on the worst excesses of capitalism.

 Modern intellectuals like Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, David Graeber and David Harvey all are influenced by and acknowledge the contributions of Marx (and reject postmodern identity politics). Should they all be damned for that, or should we admit that presenting a Manichean worldview with Marxism as the source of all evil is inaccurate, and is actually committing the same fallacy that Peterson rightly accuses his opponents of?"

If a person chooses to identify as a gender that is different from that traditionally associated with their sex, I really don't see a problem with it. However, problems definitely arise when people start trying to restrict and police other people's speech regarding particular and increasingly obscure gender pronouns. A transgender person can certainly ask people to use certain pronouns, and within reason, it could be polite for people around them to use them. But use of those pronouns shouldn't be enforced under threat of persecution!"

UgiNKU1RFK3ZPHgCoAEC,Justin Deschamps,1503597469678,"RE: Universal Basic Income (UBI): I would say, we can't make sweeping changes to society, trying to make it better, without understanding why the current systems are in place. 

Most people recognize that money is needed, but almost no one knows why, from a psychological and lawful perspective. Money, as it exists today, is a medium and agency of commerce—it helps people work together who otherwise wouldn't be motivated to do so. In the main, people can't see the benefit of working together to maintain society, so debt is needed to force their compliance. This is one reason why all money is debt. So to introduce a basic income suggests a credit-based system—that you will receive energy in support of your life from society. But this begs the question, what will you do in return? 

If we were a society focused on truth and uplifting the individual, then the citizen would likely realize they have a responsibility to society, and contribute to it willingly, thus creating an honorable social compact. But since we don't have citizens who implicitly recognize their responsibility to society—or the human race in general—the social compact would likely have to be forced, and this would make it decidedly tyrannical. By this I mean, the only way for people to receive a basic income without also accepting a social obligation is to impose requirements on them, by force, which if they don't fulfill, causes a cessation of the income. And this sounds a lot like feudalism or slavery. 

The big difference is that in order for a UBI to work, in my view, honorably social compacts would need to be in place. People would have to actually know at a personal level that they are an invaluable part of society and that they can contribute to it beneficially. The best example of that I can think of is the family. Members of a family, in an ideal situation, recognize that what they do can benefit the whole family, and chose to participate in that regard.  A mother loves her children and cares for them in a credit-based capacity, giving support freely knowing that one day—if she does her job well and the child sees the wisdom in her efforts—the child will reciprocate and do the same. In other words, when we're raised properly and with enough truth as the basis of our education, cooperation with others becomes a foundational truth, because the reality is we're interconnected at a physical, social, financial, and societal level. 

In conclusion, the more we address the deficit of knowledge within each individual, giving them the information they need to recognize how we're interconnected and why what we do improves or hinders society in general, the better we will be able to transition to a credit-based monetary system, a UBI. And it just so happens that the more technological a society becomes, the more debt-based monetary systems break down. Eventually, technology destroys the debt-based work to survive imperative, and people need to motivate themselves through altruism and beneficial works in society. 

Of course, these concepts are things most people never think about so I'm not sure how many of us are really capable of providing a rational assessment of what a UBI might mean."

Sometimes it's discouraging to have these conversations. Even if I was as articulate as JBP I feel like my message would still consistently be met with resistance. Not because it isn't based in truth, but because no one wants to feel vulnerable anymore. No one is willing to recognize that the ideas that define one's existence could be misaligned in some way.

UgjYwZHOApNQR3gCoAEC,Gavin Kisebach,1503597505439,"20:00 Mises spends the first chapter of Human Action attacking Polylogism - the idea that people from different groups have fundamentally different operating systems. At the time he was facing the Nazi threat, but this applies to Marxists with their class ideology, racial supremacists with their eugenics, et al.

"" Polylogism denies the uniformity of the logical structure of the human mind. Every social class, every nation, race, or period of history is equipped with a logic that differs from the logic of other classes, nations, races, or ages. Hence bourgeois economics differs from proletarian economics, German physics from the physics of other nations, Aryan mathematics from Semitic mathematics. 

Marxism asserts that a man's thinking is determined by his class affiliation. Every social class has a logic of its own. The product of thought cannot be anything else than an ""ideological disguise"" of the selfish class interests of the thinker. It is the task of a ""sociology of knowledge"" to unmask philosophies and scientific theories and to expose their ""ideological"" emptiness. Economics is a ""bourgeois"" makeshift, the economists are ""sycophants"" of capital. Only the classless society of the socialist utopia will substitute truth for ""ideological"" lies.

This polylogism was later taught in various other forms also. Historicism asserts that the logical structure of human thought and action is liable to change in the course of historical evolution. Racial polylogism assign to each race a logic of its own. Finally there is irrationalism, contending that reason as such is not fit to elucidate the irrational forces that determine human behavior.""

UggHkucC3wmK03gCoAEC,XerDav,1503597505541,"lol, Everquest AKA Evercrack. i had a run of that game for a couple years, yeah, it could really eat your life away. but i've actually killed way more time in dinkier MMOs than that. Tibia and Runescape (before RS3) i would clock like 8-15 hours a day, probably 40-80 hours a week. when i finally got my first job at age 21, i curbed it back a little bit, but sometimes a new game would suck me in hard, for at least a month or so.

 Skyrim was quite the fun time sink, though i kinda regret doing it on xbox. i eventually got it again for PC so i could do all the mods and GOTY edition content, but halfway through the main plot i got burned out, cuz i already experienced the game twice over on xbox. even with mods, it just wasn't enough to keep me going.

 in fact, i was jobless by the time Guildwars 2 came out, and i had tried almost all the big MMOs by now, and not so big too, but this game, though it took me a bit to really get into, that shit became a big timesink for me. not quite as bad as my 80 hour weeks i did on Runescape and Tibia, but GW2 definitely was a full-time game.

 when i eventually got another job a couple years later, after GW2 release i mean to say, i obviously had to tone down my playtime hours, but i already didn't play GW2 for too much time per day because i was big into anime during this time period, so that also took up my free time.

 i would hang out with friends, but we seldom did anything worth mentioning. drink, smoke, watch movies sometimes, and try to coordinate on sharing the same games to play. but i had different circles too, so my friend activity varied.

 one circle was more about smoking weed, playing MMOs, maybe shooters (at one point of time at least). another circle is a mix of drinkers and straight edgers who play board games and tabletop RPGs like D&D. then i have buddies who i talk music production and other random stuff.

 so i was never a complete shut in, but i do admit that i lack confidence, i lack ambition, i am not self-sufficient, and i lack a certain level of responsibility inn life, which is probably why i tend to get depressed so much throughout my life.

 no sane girl ever wanted to be with me, the only people i attract are either really odd and/or crazy girls, or like 16-17 year old jailbait girls (which if i lived in Canada this apparently wouldn't be as much of an issue, but Wisconsin is age of consent Hitler of the world, lol), and then strangely enough, gay guys seem to be into me ~shrugs~ xD

 but i realize i have to change the way i'm living, no female my age will go near me, most likely because i can't drive, i live with my mom, my job is crap, no higher education, lacking ambition and direction in life. it's no wonder that only young and strange girls are into me (but why gay guys, that's so odd, lol)."

Peterson has given no evidence that Marx himself indicated that the working class should not have a dialogue with the capitalist class. I think it's actually a combination of the offerings of social democracy and political correctness, and this very much comes from identity politics of the state-business control over society.

I also think Peterson did not state explicitly why genders are exclusive to male or female. Also, fundamentally, where does an individual derive the individual from? Is it from society or from God? How do you know that consciousness is completely individualised and the ego forms a true self?

TL;DR: Peterson is whining about ""ideology"" whilst proliferating his own Christian ideology."

It shows the arbitrary nature of most legislation.

This is why I am Libertarian, and this lines up with something that Jordan Peterson has said, if we can reduce suffering we may as well do it.

Now these SJWtards think that making a law to compel us to speak in a certain way is going to reduce suffering, but it does not because their opinion is backed by the weapon of the state, or ""the invisible gun in the room"" known as the state.

People don't think of the state as a weapon, but they should! Every law is backed by threats of violence and the use of violence, so why are we so casually supporting new laws constantly being made?

Again, this is why I am Libertarian. I don't want to give legitimacy to arbitrarily threatening theft, kidnap by police, SWAT team if they do not comply, the military if they somehow beat the SWAT team, etc. 

This is why I hate the left with a passion, this is not because the right is perfect, but because the left constantly just get outraged and then call for ""the government to do something"" which means they want to create ANOTHER excuse to use the weapon of government."

Ugg7PynfWixZIHgCoAEC,AL BERT,1503597535277,Peterson took a BIG risk by stating he can relate to sex criminals and nazi's as an aspect of himself on air !   luckily Joe stepped in to save his ass by clarifying he is talking simply about human nature nothing more...  Mr. Rogan is very impressive in the way he continually enhances the conversation that you would have thought couldn't get any deeper.
UgiLjBiitFTsQHgCoAEC,Dan_Senda,1503597535288,That was awesome. One of the best episodes yet. Thanks for making great content
UgighcTd7dB7OXgCoAEC,kevin moseley,1503597535299,As much as people didn't like his latest rogan appearance I'd love to hear Jordan Peterson and Thaddeus Russell have a discussion. As evidenced by Peterson's second talk with Sam Harris those are another two great minds who really need  to have a discussion/debate. The world of podcasting is really going down incredible rabbit holes lately.
UgiFyXZWZ4jn83gCoAEC,booby b,1503597535306,"I think jordan screws the pouch on female sexual selection. He acts as if pre historic man was whipped by prehistoric females.

Once in a while, he gets into the beginnings of an idea I might agree with.  But he has such a tendency to dart around without ever completing any of his thoughts that I never feel secure in knowing what he actually thinks.  He also sometimes comes across as ranty, such as when he mentioned the ""war"" of ideas that he sees as ongoing in modern society.  I usually check out when people start calling out secret wars."

Joe needs to stop being so optimistic about humanities future in relation to something like a universal basic income. The only reason peasants are given the pittance they make right now is because the elite risk losing their workforce if they don't comply. 

Most employers would pay workers nothing if they could. Advances in AI/Robotics creates that future Utopia for the ELITE.

UgjZ4PF7ZkEVvHgCoAEC,Mercb3ast,1503597559845,"I'm literally 4 and a half minutes into the podcast, and Peterson is talking about how many people the Soviet Union killed, and he is still, completely wrong and completely off base.

Now, let's be clear, by anyone's standards, they killed a lot. However, Mr Peterson, a scholar, should at least be up to date on the figures. He is still touting figures from a period of heavy anti-soviet propaganda, where they literally had NO idea and were just making it up as they went.

The latest figures, coming from leading western scholars in eastern european studies, are putting the entire death toll in the period of Stalinization, at 6-9 million. 

Just from the stand point of demographics, the numbers Peterson suggests, are completely ludicrous. At the top end of his estimation, 50-60 million, in addition to the 27 odd million that died in WW2, Peterson would have you believe that between ~77 million and ~87 million Soviet citizens died, the vast majority put to death by the state.

Yet. We have census data, that shows that the USSR in 1926 was somewhere around 147 million, and in 1937 somewhere around 170 million.

So basically, according to Peterson, the Soviets were literally breeding like rabbits to account for the 80 odd million deaths that they would be hit with under Stalin and WW2, so as to not lose half of their population!

In short, Jordan Peterson has no idea what he is talking about when he cites figures for deaths in the Soviet Union, he is basing his figures on long since discredited numbers from historians like RJ Rummel whose work is largely based on cherry picked figures from men whose own work has been proven to be off by magnitudes like Norman Davies. It's hard to discount just how much cold war era propaganda and an effort to make the enemy look bad played into this, also combined with the fact most of these numbers were extrapolated from ex-pats who had a bone to pick with the Soviet regime. We've seen time and time again ex-pats looking to return to their homeland outright lie about what the regime was doing in an effort to exaggerate the crimes. 

Look no further than the men who urged the US to invade Iraq in 2003, by trumping up charges, and exaggerating the affection Iraqi's would have for ""liberators.

Uggpt9CWA1HR7ngCoAEC,PerfectDeath4,1503597559866,"While studying sociology and psychology I learned about Group Loyalty, Group Exclusivity, and Polarization.
When in a group that people share similarities with (share exclusive traits with) those people will polarize their ideals and opinions to the more radical points.  This makes the group more exclusive which, in turn, makes people feel more loyalty to their group.
So, of course when the group becomes less polarized with the inclusion or encounters with diversity the group becomes less exclusive and weakens the loyalty with the group.

Ughaw5-dUMwby3gCoAEC,Euph,1503597559893,"Incredible that I can sort of see Joe becoming ""religious"" throughout his podcasts with Jordan. Not in the typical religious fashion, but in the way Jordan is. He sees the reasoning behind these religious stories and why they are important for us to keep telling. 

They aren't necessarily from ""God"", and they are far from perfect, but they help to explain who we are, how we are, and why we are what we are. Atheists that simply reject religion because science doesn't explain it are vastly inferior intellectually. Jordan is so far beyond people like Hitchens/Dawkins and his fellow professors that it is shameful. 

While it may be part of some plan or evolution that this is what reality is, it shouldn't be this way. I understand his lectures fully on why we are this way, but given the times we shouldn't be struggling this much with the truth. 

It exposes how deep the corruption truly is, when something as simple as truth is viewed as a criminal offense."

UgiZO4j3lSEQ1HgCoAEC,Euph,1503597560066,"One of the parts of the equation that both Joe and Jordan don't ever cover(which they may be doing in part for the survival of their careers and themselves) is that there are societies/groups/organizations however you want to describe them, that push this kind of evil on purpose. They are generally very intelligent, and have a deep understanding of the occult and esoteric. The micro and macro, as above so below, yin and yang type of structure to humanity and history that makes up what humanity is. 

This ""group"" often believes they are actually doing good because they are trying to keep the balance of evolution moving forward by perpetuating evil. Often times it is under the false premise of whatever religious structure they grew up with evolving into a warped view of prophecy. Look into the Frankists for more understanding of this kind of thinking. 

So in essence, what Jordan explains so well in the first podcast with Joe was more how certain atrocities take place when certain ideas are left unchecked. Along with the spiritual/religious side that ties into conservative and liberal ideologies that sort of keep things in balance. 

This stuff goes so deep and I am always learning new things and expanding my understanding. You will never understand everything about everything, and it is important to always keep an open mind. I realized my life's purpose very recently was to understand and spread the truth to the best of my ability. Nothing else matters...and without people like Jordan we would already be in hell on Earth."

UggZNXRBTgQbiHgCoAEC,MingusTale,1503597564616,"So far I'm finding this far less enlightening than the last one. Mansplaining is definitely something I expereince as a woman. Men I am friends with inturrupt other male friends of ours far less than they inturrupt me. They will interrupt and put down my ideas at the drop of the hat. Not all men are like that (at least most of the time), but it is an issue that many men do not respect women in the same way as they do men. I find it infinitely frustrating when I'm just trying to talk. I think it's entirely reasonable that female supreme justice judges experience this from male members of the court who do not beleive them as capable at their jobs as the other male court members. Of course they are not as ""oppressed"" as people of lower status but just because SJWs take on these issues as a way of garnering their precious oppression points doesn't mean they are not true problems that women face that frustrate us and affect our lives, acheivements and contentment. 

Perhaps you may say that it is obvious that men respect other men more because they pose a threat? Well then you can only cause me to despair. I'm a tall and fairly good looking woman who is not particularly stereotypically feminine (I'm a tomboy, you may say, a little butch perhaps) but I cannot be a large imposing man, or a wise old man, or any of these symbols of authority and that are built into our society. Does that mean I must lead my life being painfully aware that I'm being overlooked a lot of the time? I see in your making light of how ""oh we all know how oppressesed female superme court justices are"" why people are often pushed towards an us vs them view of things. Because you prick up a pain in that statement that is felt by ambitious women, or perhaps tomboys like me who as a child saw myself as the same as boys, when they come to the realisation that in many areas they are not safe (I have been realising recently that I am actually afraid to go outside alone in the dark ANYWHERE and my male peers simply do not understand this fear), not respected (see above) and not as free in pursuing long term careers (due to childbirth, ageism etc) and make us feel like you simply cannot understand because you have not experienced that dissapointment. Not all women are the perfect feminine (as you know) and are okay with being obliged to be more submissive and to care for children so if these women are allowed another path as we now are, can we not ask to be respected like men are?

I'm definitely not a genocidal post-modernist. I love a lot of what you say but that dismissiveness made me angry a bit because this is a problem that is particularly on my mind as I move into adulthood and try to find a correct way to go forward and am uncomfortably facing up to the limits others put on me."

ie.
30 minutes of Sex
45 minutes of listening to Music
1 hour of Rolling Jiu Jitsu
2 hours of surfing TV
3 hours of watching Movies
4 hours of playing Video Games
5 hours of Cycling
6 hours of Shooting Pool
7 hours of Binging Netflix
8 hours of Downloading Porn like the S.E.C. :P
9 hours of Stalking Elk
10 hours of reading this list

If the SONY's next PlayStation was repositioned as an Interactive Media Centre, rather than a Video Game console, and they actively partnered with digital content creators to produce Interactive Content that provided truly satisfying virtual goals, the industry would explode and eventually replace Universities as the primary source of Undergraduate Degrees.

ie.
A virtual garage, which contains top of the line hardware and an AI teacher sprite, to teach Mechanical Engineering visually and through virtual building projects. So you can build a GoKart from scratch and a Track and race your friends. So the satisfaction of winning won't just be from being a better driver, but from designing a better GoKart.

That experience in the real world is only available to million dollar sponsored teams.
I bet you can come up with even better ideas, for interactive education, that's more fun than gaming."

UgiHRz2RXF4TgHgCoAEC,owenhunt,1503597572155,"I saw Jordan Peterson on 'Louder with Crowder' in December 2016 and wondered what the fuss concerning him was. A slender, humble and nondescript gentleman turned up to Crowder's studio and was summarily bulldozed (in the segment I saw) by the titular host. His speciality seemed to be combatting SJW warriors. Such an overlayer at the time seemed to justify Crowder's disregard for Peterson's presence because the worst thing after an SJW must surely be their professional opponenent, right?

Yet here I am almost five months later just marvelling at this man's ability to micro-philosophise on intellectual events, as in ''Kekistan' and as in Yeung's antrho-monsterization, on a level that seems to far outstrip a man he at first seemed a poor impression of: Stefan Molyneux. Molynuex is a stalwart researcher who makes time for leftist arguments if only to lure it onto his wrecking floor of facts, virtue and Western reason. Yet the man leaves me cold in his theological dismissal of the Bible which most elders know to be a tome of the peripetatic battles of a middle eastern people's who documented all their major tactical, psychological battles and lifestyle practices into a logical history. Jordan Peterson manages to balance the acts of discussing biological behavioural bases with theological underpinnings in a way that I appreciate.

I understand why he is doing it, but I can't help to feel that he ignores the mob like, in and out group mentality associated with religion. Those who have issue with that aren't in conflict with the morals that can be obtained from the doctrine, but rather people's propensity to use faith to control others and push their own agenda. As a person who also loves truth, I love this man and this is my only issue with his thinking. He seems to talk down to those he calls ""new atheists"" and it's hard to agree when he says something like ""Christianity was killed by the sword of truth it created"". What about the people who sacrificed their lives for rationality? Also, i feel that Dr.Peterson should refrain from using phrases such as ""god of rage"", etc. it will be misunderstood by those who cannot think logically. As someone in his position, i think he should use vernacular that is more difficult to misinterpret.

In other words he doesn't need to dumb down his thought process and thus can excel at teaching anyone if they are willing to sit down and listen. You'd think this kind of skill would be mandatory for becoming any kind of teacher, but sadly a huge percent of actual teachers lack this kind of understanding and passion when they are trying to teach their students.

foolish jokes aside, I constantly think about my perceptions and how I process the world. A great overview of a way to consider it came when Jordan was explaining how the Marxist ideologies go astray when they meet the notion that there's an infinite number of ways to interpret the world. Anyway, he says this as he leads in to explaining why they are wrong there. So simple yet profound.

""The world is complicated beyond our ability to comprehend, so there is a very large number of ways you can interpret it ...but ...but ...you have to extract out from the world, a way... a game from your interpretation that you can actually play. So, if  the lesson that you extract from Hamlet is that you should kill your family and yourself, then we might say that is not a very functional interpretation, right? Because, first of all, people are going to object to that, It ends your life and it ends many peoples lives people are going to object to it. And It isn't a game you can play over and over again in the world. So, when we're interacting with the world, you see, what we're trying to do is to extract out a set of tools that we can use to function in the world, because we're constrained by the world, so we don't suffer too much and so that the things we need to continue can be provided. And we need to extract those out in a way so that other people will cooperate and compete with us in a peaceful and maintainable way. So, then you think, well we have to extract out an interpretation that allows us to live and thrive over multiple periods of time in multiple environments while we are doing the same thing with other individuals who are motivated the same way.""

UgiisfxaErW4VHgCoAEC,matrix3509,1503597601160,"Dr. Peterson's comments about realizing your monstrous nature, and then gaining control of it, reminds me of The Empire Strikes Back.

When Luke enters the cave and gets his vision of Vader, only to see it revealed as himself, its very obviously a nod at that sentiment. Luke realizes that he has a capacity for evil that he was unaware of before. But that scene was also a clever foreshadowing of Vader's familial ties with Luke, and a clever hint that simply being aware of your monster isn't enough, because you have to gain control of it. This is symbolized by Luke's first duel with Vader. The battle itself, and the reveal on the catwalk is Luke's true realization that he is capable of becoming the next Vader. The thought of it is enough to make him suicidal, but it is also him completely refusing to let his monster gain control. So, while Luke lost the literal duel, he won the metaphorical duel.

Of course in real life, most people will just smack into the bottom of the station and that will be the end, but since Luke is the hero, his destiny directed him into the ventilation shaft.

I'm sure most people have figured all this out before, since Empire has likely been analyzed to death, but its one thing to learn knowledge, but its quite another to embody the knowledge you take into your head."

“But WHEN do the biggest sophists turn out young and old, men & women, JUST the way they want them to be?” Glaucon asks.  

Socrates answers, “When many gathered together sit down in assemblies, courts, theaters, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude, and with a great deal of uproar, blame some of the things said or done, and praise others, both in excess, shouting and clapping; and, besides, the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of blame and praise.  

""Now in such circumstances, as the saying goes, what do you suppose is the state of the young man’s heart?  Or what kind of private education will hold out for him and not be swept away by such blame and praise and go, borne by the flood, wherever it tends, so that he’ll say the same things are noble and base as they do, practice what they practice, and be such as they are?”"

Ugg97X8lwMp2mngCoAEC,MJA,1503597614610,"The problem with accepting gay and transsexual people because you're socially supposed to is that people still aren't going to truly accept them, so when the trend fades, they'll go back to being looked at as fags and trannies.

UgiUqOi_Rn6pyngCoAEC,Charles Hill,1503597614643,"There is a pivotal shift coming in economic terms as well. Capitalism is reaching its inherent point of obsolesces as a system for the production of wealth. Technological advancement will inevitably supersede the capacity to capitalise upon it.  Capitalism is predicated on the symbiotic relationship between producer and consumer. Traditionally occupying  differing roles as workers and purchasers within the same cyclical system of wealth creation. Wages fund consumption, consumption creates demand for further production, production creates employment and that leads to wages. So as automation, robotics, information Tec and AI continues to increase in efficiency it reduces employment in production, skilled labour and service industries. Production needs ever decreasing labour in both skilled and unskilled fields. No labour no wage thus no purchasing power for consumption diminishing returns on production. Money creation through debt is the short term band aid.  Debt adds the promise of future labour to the equation but that to is not infinite in its capacity to expand.  Labour diminishes in value as automation improves thus future labour is of diminished value....Big Problem....Debt becomes higher in risk and lending and liquidity diminish confidences disappears. Pivotal shifts are coming systemic change ideological turmoil is symptomatic of this tectonic shifts. We are on the cusp of great change. Opportunity can be seized for a leap forward and a new enlightenment but equally and probably more likely a lack of vision and now self-interest could precipitate collapse. 2007 was a precursor the first cracks in the dam."

Jordan also talks often about this kind of truth warrior. I don't want to be a warrior! XD Men would prefer that metaphor. But he not only talks about the truth warrior, he talks about the wise, logical, ethical warrior-orator and there is no such strong emphasis on a fleshed out ideal for women beyond the divine mother that protects the child from predators.

Well, Peterson has indeed internalized postmodern ideas. That's the problem with those things. They manifest themselves in all kinds of places. Postmodernism is older and wider than hows Peterson defines it. Peterson is talking about a certain part of the phenomenon, a more recent an much more popular one. 

Optimal groups size is somewhat less then 150. 250 is much to many. PTSD happens due to things happening to the person, not necessarily because of something that the person had done. This is why artillery makes so many people PTSD, or shell-shocked - as it used to be could during less PC times. Joe tried to correct Jordan, but Jordan returned to his line, dare I say, postmodern, line of thinking.

His automobile metaphor is a bit of lovely american BS - try driving a car with no roads, road signs, police, tech-support etc. The only grain of truth this is that showing in movies that all Americans, even poor ones, had cars showed the communist masses how poor as compared to the west the actually were.

Chimps are probably self-aware. 
He needs to check how humane hunter gatherers mate - may collide with large part of his arguments. 

The last 50 years brought very little in terms of real improvements. The years from around 1850 to 1970 - is another deal entirely. 

The problem with Peterson (and postmodernism), from my point of view, is that despite of its falsehoods, some things he tells rings true.

Some of them were what I consider to be true intellectuals like Jordan who actually negotiated ideas, while others were the malignant types who bowed down at the altars of Foucalt or Derrida and made their entire academic mission in life to espouse singular ideologies. Jordan is a profoundly intelligent man who I believe has good intentions, but more importantly, he's willing to engage in legitimate dialogue with anyone and everyone who disagrees with him on various topics. There is a massive divide in the U.S. especially, and nothing will ever get solved unless people start talking. We need more discourse and less echo chambers."

I hate the idea of left or right, I'm for progress. but if I had to say.. would consider myself left leaning. I hate trump and everything he stands for and seemingly the majority of other right wing values. however, this new description of the left and things I hear about the left, I don't agree with at all. but I don't see the response being any better. I see and hear more about supposed left wing bs through the right bitching about it then I do from the actual left promoting it. same for the whole transgender issue.. I hear more from ppl having nothing to do with it then from actual transgendered people. the ppl supposedly fighting for their rights, aren't even the actual ppl in the situation. over n over again. I kinda like Joe didn't put left or right in the description, since apparently this guy is popular with each but for very different reasons. but it kept me from having a predisposed thought against or for him, even if I don't realize it. but it also helps to know exactly where he's coming from, very few, even professional doctors, are completely neutral. not that he has to be from a side but let's you become of aware of any possible agenda's at play. interesting none the less."

I don't know though whether he's commenting on ""other"" as an ""alien sex"" or ""intersex"" - because intersex is not alien at all, it does exist and is not as uncommon as we'd think. It just mostly gets ""fixed"" at an extremely young age."

We did not have 3 mandatory lectures or assignments for ANY other topics, except perhaps those involving physical diagnosis and reading EKG's. We also have safe-spaces, and a letter from our dean regarding the outcome of the election assuring that there would be safe-spaces if needed. This is easily a top 30 Allopathic medical school in the United States (some may argue top 15 or top 10). We have posters explaining consent in every male bathroom. This regressive left ideology does not end after college. It's beginning to poison our medical schools, and even the practice of medicine. I'm now working as a researcher in a hospital as part of our curriculum, and have worked as a biological researcher for a few years. Both labs believe wholeheartedly in the wage-gap and that there is discrimination in science. Nevermind that each lab is a STEM lab, and that women outnumbered men ~2:1. I fear that even the leading voices denouncing this kind of poisonous thought are underestimating it's stranglehold on the science and applied-science fields including medicine, and it's entrance into the mainstream job market."

This all started in the Frankfurt School in Germany, when the Marxists realized that the workers of the world weren't going to unite and demand communism, so they decided to usher in cultural marxism.

If you somehow get them to concede that point, they will deny that both countries killed more people than Nazi Germany, which is completely bonkers.  Russia, alone, killed on the order of 90 million people, China another 60 million.  There has been no more brutal ideology in the history of mankind than Communism.  Hell, the father of Socialism and Communism, Karl Marx, outright said that some people (capitalists, business/land owners and the religious) would refuse to go along with socialism and communism and they would need to be killed. So the whole ideology from start to finish is built on blood and suffering, but you will never, ever get a communist to admit that their ideology is brutal, or responsible for human deaths.  They have an extreme form of cognitive dissonance and if you present ANY facts from a source that isn't friendly to their cause, they will refuse to believe or recognize the facts...which is very clever, because they never have to read or think about anything which is contrary to their own ideology.

Also, you can forget having a civil or productive conversation with them.  They don't even see people who oppose them as human beings.  They WILL use physical violence against you and I think they're some of the most dangerous people out there because they will do ANYTHING to force their ideology down people's throats.

This is so true! I didn't even realize it until a few years ago; I've been living in Japan for 6 years, and something about this culture bothered me from pretty much the beginning. I couldn't figure out what it was for years and just chopped it up to me not understanding their culture, which was true but not in the multicultural [all cultures are equal but different] way that I thought then. Over the last few years I've been obsessed with understanding the difference between individualism and collectivism, and I now believe that I know what it is that urks me about Japanese culture; it's their values and priorities that I can't accept. They value group cohesion above everything else (like a cult), so honesty often falls along the wayside. This bothers me so much because [as a Westerner] honesty and logic are very high on my list of priorities. Because of this I no longer believe all cultures are equal but different; it's become painfully clear to me that some cultures do certain things better, and should be praised for that, even at the risk of being called a racist or whatever by SJWs."

 Generously allow me to say  .. the world was by and large, excepting some species MATRIARCHAL. All of history can be revisited for evidence of the woman's displacement as contributing members of thriving societies, however, one has to beat the trail back into oral history.
 I am filled with the terrors whenever I listen to your show Mr Rogan. Maybe men don't accept that history has been sent askew (at many convenient junctures) because the accepted narrative suits a male dominant perspective.
 
We're being guided and cajoled deeper and deeper and I think the only way out is to come clean, don't keep adding to the mire with false historical narratives, however learned they may be. Humankind was driven into the ditch somewhere and it's certainly along the given and accepted narratives. 

[((((We all see the world through our conditioning (genetics play a part in many ways, yes) our belief systems, and the FACTS that we have to work with. Maybe young people are willing to accept such a narrow view, and fight for it,  because the conflict within their belief systems create anxiety and instead of reviewing belief systems, more are added causing overload. I wonder where human intuitiveness and  instinct fit in the male hierarchy. Instinct and intuitiveness as a guide for well-being, not just as a mechanism.  To my understanding all of these problems arise from being told to accept lies and half truths, something that's made this psychotic society thrive.)))]

UggySgUAZ8K9HXgCoAEC,Miles Brown,1503597709291,"Thoughts anyone? My Issues(?) with Peterson: 
- I think Nietzsche is misrepresented. Nietzsche was an extremely adamant and harsh critic of Christianity, and even said he aspired to be the ""great destroyer"" and ""antichrist."" Having read most of his work, it doesn't seem clear to me that he was much upset by the impending collapse of theism. It was an ambition of his! 
- I don't think that Christianity can be credited much for cultivating the Western value of truth. I think the Greeks and their culture of philosophy probably deserve most of the credit. Christianity almost destroyed it, and thankfully it has somewhat survived Christianity and has been integrated into our culture.
- Peterson seems to think that the carnage of the 20th century was due to the ""death of God"", since Christian values and moral systems were not in place anymore, and therefore more destructive ideologies filled that gap. I think this is incorrect. Christians and people with strict religious principles in the  past were certainly extremely brutal, murderous and cruel. However they didn't have the same means to destroy that people had in the 20th century. 
- He seems to think that religion gave people meaning in their lives, and now that our culture is taking a more objective approach, its harder to find meaning in our lives. That's not my experience with religion at all, and I don't think religion ever solved that problem anyway, except maybe for a few very simple minded people who were capable of such blind acceptance of dogma as ""meaning"". Having grown up as a very devoted religious person, Christianity did not give me sufficient meaning at all. It was painfully lacking. I can't imagine that it would have been sufficient for ancient peoples either, and suggesting that perhaps it would be better for society to embrace some false, mythical, convoluted moral structure that we had no part in creating seems contrary to Peterson's value of ""truth telling."" 

Having said all that, I deeply admire Peterson and listening to his talks has helped me tremendously. These issues stand out to me though, and I'd be curious to here anyone else's thoughtful opinion as well!"

Listen, we don't have time for people to deal with their internal corruption and then step up to the plate to make a difference. What we need is mass civil disobedience without any violence.  Protesting does work if enough people show up. If over 100 000 people hit the streets, the cops and the military won't intervene cause it's impossible. If we do this world wide and protest against the government, maybe it we will have a chance to dismantle it and maybe a crooked government will not take its place. It all depends on the integrity of our whistle blowers and the remainder of our power structure that is still operating under a clear moral compass. Remember, it takes power to remove power. You may ask, how do we get a coordinated attempt among the mass to participate in this large scale protest? You cannot! lol. It will happen on it own as chaos erupts in that manner. As the austerity measures decline in our society, people will have time or the means to deal with internal vices. We have a power structure that controls ever facet of our lives and not too mention our external environment is too toxic. On that note, society is a ticking time bomb and people who desire will change, I say, sit back and relax and enjoy the ride because the shit is about to hit the fan real soon.

I never looked to confirm biases because I could honestly say that I had none (roughly speaking). I wanted to reason on my own so I read and I read and experienced and experienced. I was always honest and considered myself agnostic as if by consequence it took me on a journey to understand and know what I previously didn't. I was fascinated by Jesus and his parables and the logos and then I came upon Jordan Peterson and he started to articulate my own similar thoughts about those matters . truly wonderful to listen to not because I take his word over my own but his word catalyzes my own development to further integrate the pieces of my self as I fortify every level of my being.

He grossly underestimate men and tend to urge men as a goup to do everything (when they are already doing it) because ''women have enough on their plate''... doing nothing as a group except pushing western civilization to the edge of destruction with their entitlements, desire to trade freedom for safety and feelingz.

However I will say that Peterson's grant denial is interesting. We definitely need more info before you can reach a conclusion as to why it was denied, that's just being intellectually honest and not going with the answer you want, but I haven't heard from him yet if there is any update."

The question I'd like to pose to Dr. Peterson is; do you know the political correctness, the collectivist mindset, and the gender identity confusion has been pushed upon the dumbed down masses by the ruling oligarchs?Through various tax exempt foundations, and most importantly the control of the money supply (Ie the federal reserve) they have been able to mould society to their liking. Break apart the family, attack the spiritual foundation of the people, get the mother out of the house, and let state run education and tv raise your children. Boom this is what you get. 

The weaponized propaganda that is pumped through the media 24/7 would make Joseph Goebbels proud. This is a grand conspiracy that has been in the works for over 100 years. America was officially conquered December 23rd 1913. However, It is somewhat entertaining to see the divide and conquer pushed by the media and the false paradigm of the left vs right political ideology. It's working like clockwork.

That's true, but I feel like the best one can emerge out of materialism is also a nihilist. When I broke from Christianity at the age of 16 and became a materialist, it only took me maybe two years or so before I was a full blown nihilist, and I don't think it's because my logical inferences were incorrect. Rather, they were entirely correct given the information I was working with. Pure egoism, moral relativism, and hard determinism became irrefutable facts under the axioms that underlay scientific materialism, and if one is merely a cosmic puppet in a world void of any objective meaning or values, life becomes absurdly nihilistic."

I live in France, so the system is probably a lot different, but I chose engineering with my scientific baccalauréat, so no where near psychology or psychiatry, or even anything related to biology, except maybe chemistry, but we didn't study anything alive. Although I can't say I'm totally uneducated in psychology, because I find it interesting, and I've spent quite some time thinking about human psychology, not so much researching it though, except evolutionary psychology.

The stupid ass thing about gender unicorn and gengerbread are all from feminine energy. The passive aggressive way of dealing with things you cannot overcome with thought, logic or intellect is shown clearly by the brainwashed students using the bullhorn to drown out the professor. That is the feminine way of doing things. The whole feminist movement was funded and created by the Rothschilds and Rockerfellers from all the way from the (See Edward Bernays) 1920s till now is to invoke and manifest the feminine energy in order to do battle against the masculine energy. The ultimate goal is to divide us, so we will be easier to manage, control and ultimately annihilate. Men don't use bullhorns to drown out speech in protest, we walk up to the guy and tell it like it is. That is how men do things. Never in the history of protests do we stand around and make loud noises or bang things like children so another party cannot talk. We march and protest and if we continue to do this and nothing gets done, we use physical force to remove the cancer. Which is why free-speech and right to bear arms is very important.         The strategy is to use passive-aggressive tactics to push us in to action. The exact same strategy women use when they are no happy, they talk and talk and talk and talk, until the man snaps. Then they cry and said how dare you raise you voice at me. That's women. Sad to say but the women are not smart enough to figure it out and when they do finally regret it, it will be too late."

Feminism does not stand for equality, if it did, then all rights of all individuals would be upheld equally and injustices of inequality would be fought for all individuals and not just females. Egalitarianism is the real term for equality. 

Personally the whole gender issue, is a non issue. You are either male or female and in rare cases a hermaphrodite or true hermaphrodite. Beyond that, who cares really. Keep it simple. Some men are masculine some are effeminate, some women are girly and some are butch. All with sexual preferences in between. 

As for the Ontario Human Rights Commission, they are totally ass backwards! This group is being paid to do a study on race issues. FYI!!!!! Race taxonomy has been debunked. What they are truly being paid to do, is keep humans dividing by generalized categories, in order to give extra privilege to people based on skin colour phenotypes. This is to perpetuate outdated divisions like Black and White, in order to say that white privilege exists. Our government (tax payers) will be paying for the study.  All the while, if you happen to have lighter skin tones and more pheomelanin, tough cookies. In their eyes, only people with lots of eumelanin can understand poverty and prejudice. We need to stop using outdated social constructs, like white and black, because people lose site of individuality and start to generalize by phenotypes."

Joe asks, ""Why are desires to overcome obstacles tied to happiness in life?"" Jordan responds, ""It's in our nature."" To be more specific, I think you can relate this back to the dominance hierarchy and ideal of the hero discussed earlier. The man that rises to the top of a stable hierarchy is one that sacrifices for the tribe, the one that takes the risk kills the snake. The snake could also be viewed as an obstacle to happiness, because if the threat gets its way it can disrupt a stable hierarchy, perhaps to the point where the hero doesn't rise to the top of the hierarchy. It would have fallen into chaos which is not so clearly as navigable.  Then, you could even say there is self interest in overcoming obstacles in that it keeps the stable hierarchy intact. If this is true, it would only make sense for men to derive happiness from overcoming obstacles; both to keep the hierarchy they understand and can navigate intact, but also because overcoming those obstacles moves you up the hierarchy. So the desire to overcome obstacles to obtain happiness is implicit in the idea of the hierarchy and the ideal of the hero. 

Suffering could be viewed as potentially the biggest snake of them all in this respect. This could explain why people find such happiness in meaning in alleviating it, as per Jordan's advice. Though, viewed in this way, would women experience this desire to overcome obstacles in the same way, since the ideal of the hero is more instilled in men since they are the ones who operate in the hierarchy?"

The underworld is full of things that are weird mixtures of thoughts and emotions, and thinking of them as actual people keeps them from controlling you."

Joe: So what it really is [religious doctrine] is the accounts of people trying to work out the issues of being human?

Other professors and talking heads had a premonition of this I'm sure, but they just lacked the ability or confidence in their arguments to speak out. And they never did. Until now.  I remember thinking, it can only now be, because I'm witnessing greatness. This is a great man before me. The mind of a master.  And I'm so glad now, with the master here on full display, you all get to bear witness, so there can be no mistake."

Jordan B. Peterson clearly has a lot to say, and a lot of what he is saying makes great and total sense.
Personally I'm not much for the exclusively historic interpretation of human behavior, paired with the all-imprisoning sense of essentialism, completely neglecting to fathom the fact that human beings can and will adapt, regardless of prehistoric tendencies. Personally I find the rule of existentialism much more compelling and useful as a survival tool. 

Also, witnessing the sheer multitude of mislead, mind-numbed acolytes lightning up in the comment thread by the sight and sound of their new deity is by every stretch of the imagination nauseating. The fact that not a single one of you seems the least suspicious, or even remotely expressing what could hopefully be categorized as mildly skeptical, should tell you something circumspect about yourselves."

That is not a difficult question. In an unregulated population, men outnumber women at birth, throughout youth and most of the productive age. It is about 105-107 males per 100 females at birth. Guess what happens to those redundant ~5% of men in a society like ours, and what kinds of social pressure it applies to all men who are at any point of their lives threatened to appear below this line.

Like if a guy tries to explain period cramps to a woman who has experienced them herself. It is not supposed to refer to ANY time a guy explains ANYTHING to a girl. 

It's important to make a distinction between what certain words are supposed to mean and how stupid people have bastardized them. I'm pretty sure mansplaining started as a funny urban dictionary term, not to be taken seriously.

even though, in my opinion, the ultimate truth can never be communicated through language(i think this is something the postmodernists get right). his message can help society move up to the next societal paradigm. because it does seem that societies go through certain paradigms to evolve. just like you and me will adopt different views of life during the course from birth to death."

Imagine kids going to school and basically running live simulations of core, real-life situations in order to develop the skills needed to handle life.

UghvjlXhKQ5lUngCoAEC,J Carter,1503597908134,"Speaking as a woman, I think the offense being taken regarding motherhood as your biggest role is due to females growing up in a culture where motherhood has become trivialized. The whole ""oh, you're just a mom"" or the ""oh so you don't really 'work'"". And to be honest, this has really come down from other women today. I think in previous generations it may have come from a select few males in places with voices, but today, this is women bringing down other women. As if they have no purpose being 'just a mom'. It's way too common to drop kids in daycare and rely on the system to raise children today. So you've taken the deep involvement away from women. Part of that was the dual income trap. Which was perpetuated by many all over as it brings more revenue to the government, it raises the GDP, and it leaves your children at the mercy of the system to be raised to be little worker bees and do what the system wants/needs, vs what your family/tribe wants needs. Then those kids raise their kids the same way later. And moms are not home long enough bonding with their infants after birth. It's a slow masculinization of females basically. It's scientifically proven that children elicit hormonal responses in women that feminizes them more. Which is funny because there's a slow feminization of males going on as well. There's a cultural pull to create this hybrid, genderless population with little difference and individuality. But we need to stop looking at the word 'mom' as an offensive term. It is an honor and a role of amazing strength and power. NOBODY can parent as well as a mother that is at home and engaged with her children. The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world."

I appreciate that Haidt is usually very fair about taking the time to outline the benefits of having people concerned with social justice (the reasonable, non-authoritative people, not the infantile SJW types) because they do serve a purpose in exposing real concerns about exploitation, which IS a value to society. He has some fascinating lectures on the nature and evolution of morality, and how morality affects the liberal and conservative ethos.

And I think the same goes for females choosing to embrace their masculine side vs their more powerful feminine side. Neither will go far. We've been in this war against our actual hormonal makeup (men and women) for a long time and with that our overall fulfillment and potential to attain whole happiness as individuals has drastically dropped. Waging a war against nature is never easy, nor is it generally enjoyable as it's a road paved with much turbulence.

But, you seem to have trouble with ignoring some very true and accurate critiques that Marxism has regarding capitalism. Capitalism is inherently exploitive in that it dehumanizes and alienates the people who work for large corporations, big businesses, etc., since selling your labour turns you into just as much of a commodity as what you produce. What I don't understand is that why can't we criticize Capitalism? Being critical of something is necessary to improve it. So Marxism/Socialism/Communism aren't the answer then, but lets not put Capitalism on a pedestal when it carries so many inherent flaws as well."

He really brings the logic in to those stories and it dawns on me how many believers I know that really don't grasp the actual morals of these tales. How amazing would human beings be if they actually understood the context? And how enlightened were the 'prophets' to basically be writing about philosophy, the human condition and psychology at that time? It's easy to see how the people then were thinking they were connected by some line to something greater than their understanding (god). So deeply rooted in humanism and it's true that it is oddly the same as Harry Potter or Star Wars or Narnia or even Tolkien. Really makes me look at some religions in a different light. It really is like a moral compass."

There is something at the nucleus of his lectures and interviews that many others have also tried to do over and over again, and that is to be honest and genuine in all of your dealings in life. That is a message worth reiterating again and again.

It's too bad that he doesn't really do that himself if you actually critically examine his words, and neither do 99.9999% of the people you'll ever meet. Everyone is trying to sell you an angle, and unfortunately he is not an exception."

It takes a great deal of courage to stand for what you believe and speak the truth in our modern day society. 

I have never spent more than 30-40 min on a YouTube video, and yet I have watched this podcast twice. Of all the things that Dr Peterson said, I found these lines to be most profound:

""...telling the truth is a good start. Because then you don’t fool yourself about who you are. And it is not self-evident that you should always tell the truth; the smarter the kid, the earlier they learn to lie. Lying is very powerful, because you can manipulate the world with your language, and then you can get what you want a lot of times, or escape from things that you do not want. So why not lie all the time then? One major reason is that you cannot trust yourself if you lie. And there will be times in your life when you have no one to turn to except yourself. And if you’ve stuffed yourself full of lies, then you are going to be in a crisis some day and you are going to make a decision, and you are going to decide wrong. And you’re going to be in real trouble, because you won’t have the clarity of mind to make the proper judgment- because you have filled your perception and imagination with rubbish""."

Extremely profound and enriching dialogue. So many parts that I want to say are my favorite. 

The cleaning your room concept/metaphor caused me to recall what one of my best friends told me many years ago when I was going through a difficult time. ""The exterior is a reflection of the interior."" which is accredited to Immanuel Kant. and this simple quote helped me regain my balance and discipline and work things out.

Toward the end, I feel, that though excellence IS celebrated in the U.S., mediocrity is celebrated more, hence as Dr. Peterson mentions students (particularly boys, as was mentioned is in our nature to be competitive) tune out in school and which would explain some the addictions to the digital/virtual games that Joe mentioned and the stark reality that this has been the culprit of many people finding themselves unsatisfied not only with their lives, but with their existence. By eliminating competition, we are eliminating the possibility of character building events in people's lives. This ever present chaos that we are being witnesses to truly IS blurring the ""lines"" of many things to the point that even the natural law that is engraved in the heart of man is being erased. No longer are we conscious, much less conscientious and we are constantly consuming things to numb the pain of existing. We have managed to make the gift of life become a pain. And the truth is that we have made it a burden because we have chosen to eliminate death. 

How you may ask? Simply by the way we live our lives. Though our essence is eternal our physical bodies are finite and will expire at some point and it is this truth, the reality that we are going to die that some people sadly don't know about. The games, media (everybody has ear buds plugged in at all times now) and other things we do to alienate ourselves are really just distractions to occupy the time we think we have (or own) which in reality is very limited. Even if we're lucky and get to live to 100 yrs of age, our time is limited. Live life! Go meet 250 people! Get scraped (for real) get dirty, explore etc etc etc etc...

This will definitely be on loop for me for a while."

You might not actually rape someone at this very moment because you have ""control over yourself"" but what if you lived in Bosnia or Germany during the war times when a lot of the military men were raping vulnerable women. Those same men thought that they were noble and great men and would probably fit into society now because there are punishments but look at how they turned out when there were no consequences and they were free to rape and murder as they pleased.

First thing that was noticeable to me was that I wasn't as quick to troll idiots on the net, because even though I felt I had a better argument, JBPs message to ""build your opposition's argument up not as a strawman, but so as to make it as robust as possible"" meant that I could see the mental energy I was putting into a forum that was going fucking nowhere. It meant that I had to ensure that my argument was sound with facts and figures, not with the feelings or hearsay. This resulted in two things, one being I began to further research the facts of that which I knew to be true, delving further into the statistics and the like, particularly considering there is so much ""globalised"" or Americanised information and I needed it to be more Australian specific if I was to take on the ideologues in my own country. Two, it meant that I stopped engaging in waste of time trolling. I have listened to his entire Maps of Meaning catalogue, engaged in the self authoring suite (although not finished), and have an insanely organised ""To Do/Goals"" list prepped in Google Docs that has me already achieving shit I thought I had lost motivation for a long time ago. On that list was basically to tidy, clean, and organise my room and house, a task of which I broke out into small but achievable goals, and got it done within about three days.

than his followers realise. His interminable references to mythology 
when Joe's often trying to make straightforward points, followed by the 
continual resurfacing of his anti-Marxist, pro-individualist agenda is a
 little irritating. When it comes to freedom of speech, I entirely 
empathise with his struggle. But the way he speciously argues about 
religion and the ills of communism -- well, his emotion seems to betray 
him, and for fleeting moments it appears like he has other ulterior 
motives in play, whatever they may be.

Most worrying of all though is the sheer number of people who fall on 
his every word because he is articulate and, understandably, 
intellectually stimulating. You can be both of these things and yet 
completely wrong or at least misguided. Best to take a critical view at 
times folks. If he cared a little more about the truth, he'd take time 
to unpack some of the heavily loaded statements he fires out like a

The least that you can do, is define your terms clearly and simply, so that everyone understands what you mean.
I think I do understand (I'm pretty sure), but even I have to pause a few times and question whether I got it right.
So define those key words, Dr. Peterson. Because half the audience of this podcast (judging by the comments at least) got it wrong, to the point where they think you are advocating for Christianity and you are a believer in God.

Or maybe I am the one who got it wrong, who knows, right?

You say that we are in danger of killing God or killed God or something like that, and that we need to resurrect that ancient wisdom. What the hell do you mean by that?
God can be killed? What ancient wisdom are you talking about?

We need to go back to these ancient myths and traditions? Become ignorant and superstitious and stupid again?
The hell are you talking about?

These are reasonable questions based on what you said.
You do need to define your terms, and explain what you mean exactly, so that it is clearly understood.
You speak with nebulous terms, undefined terms and therefore people will misinterpret what you said, without a doubt.

Make your case clearly and rationally, otherwise you are speaking nonsense sir.

Scrutiny is the best way to separate the truth from falsehood, and your arguments and claims need to undergo scrutiny, otherwise people will have to accept them based on personal feelings or faith, which is irrational.

That is all."

Its just an emotional appeal, and he's good at eliciting emotion and get
 the reactions that he wants. 
He knows that logic and reason isnt particularly effective, so he's 
using his strengths to his advantage.

I would advise you all to try to think logically and critically, but if 
you get goosebumps by silly phrases (""I'm trying to resurrect the dormant logos I suppose"") like these, then you're pretty much hopeless.

Stop deifying Jordan Peterson, and realize he is just a fallible human 
being, he can be wrong just like everyone else.

That awe, that emotional effect btw, its the same thing that Christians 
and Muslims feel when they go to church and listen to their preachers.
Its not about truth, its not about fact, its about eliciting certain 
emotions, and those emotions are much more powerful that any 
demonstrable fact, truth or logical argument.

You are becoming sheep, and you will follow your preacher, no matter how
 wrong they might be.

No Jordan, it is just a superstition, for many many people. Just because you've taken all these religious texts, analyzed them, and extracted something about humanity, it doesnt mean that people themselves that believe and have believed this stuff for a long time feel the same way.

Let me explain:
You cant just disregard all those people that believe that there is a God, an actual being, with anthropomorphic traits, who gets angry, and jealous, and sad, and is the Creator of everything that exists, and can communicate with you, and has expectations of you, etc.
People that believe that the Bible is the word of this omnipotent God, and he wants you to believe and follow his rules, and the Bible is a historical account of what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and yes also what will happen in the future until the end times and even past that.
They believe that the stories in the Bible are real stories that did happen, literally. Some people believe all hose stories literally, others take some of them literally and some metaphorically, but they do believe them.

You cant just ignore and disregard the fact that most theists in the world believe this stuff for real, in a completely different way than you do.
And those people dont look for psychological significance, nor do they have the ""deep"" interpretations that you have, (which arent really deep to be honest, you just look at things on the surface, ignore all the little details, and craft your own narrative).

I've spent countless of hours talking to people that believe the Flood story in the bible (Noah's Ark) really happened, literally, the way its described in the Bible, and they have to either chuck a great deal of science in the garbage can, or they end up being in a state of cognitive dissonance, where somehow science has got it right, and their religious book is also 100% true a correct.

It is extremely obvious, from the way you talk about all these religious and non-religious stories, such as the story of Adam & Eve, Pinocchio, etc, that you try to extract some significance out of them, you look for deep meanings, and you use those meanings to craft your own narrative and present a certain perspective/view on how people think, feel and act - on the way human beings are, really.
I'm sure that in your mind, this narrative and these stories somehow all connect and make deep sense to you.
But some times what you say doesnt really make sense, you tend to use your own lingo to explain things, and one has to get used to the way you speak and express yourself.
Sometimes your definitions are a bit off or unusual, sometimes you go down rabbit holes that lead elsewhere, and sometimes you do a full 360 and return to the original point.

What I'm trying to say is, that you tend to think A LOT in a metaphorical sense, in an interpretational sense, and that ends up being somewhat vague and non-specific.

If you were in a debate, and you talked in the exact same manner, most of the things you say could be defeated by a simple ""What the hell do you mean by that? That doesnt make much sense"". And thats really not a good position to be in a debate.
 The audience is left confused and will tend to side with your opponent rather than you.
Dont get me wrong, I know exactly what you mean (or at least I think I do) 90% of the time, but I am someone who has listened to you talk quite A LOT.

So, to get back to the original point:
No Jordan, its not those ""new atheists"" that got it wrong, its you. 
You tend to try hard to find deepities and look for hidden meanings, and craft narratives, and you have you own interpretation of all these myths and stories.

Tell me, why is your interpretation better than any Christian's interpretation (literal or metaphorical) when it comes to the Bible?
Why should we accept your interpretation over any other for that matter?
Sure you dont make appeals to the supernatural, and that makes your interpretation definitely more realistic and rational.
But its still an interpretation, its subjective, there's no way to determine that it is THE interpretation, the one that is correct and accurate.

In fact, those ""New Atheists"" that you mentioned have acknowledged that problem and freely admit and understand that there is no way to tell who is correct when interpreting religious stories and other myths.
There are stuff in the bible that are crystal clear, direct straightforward commands from God, that leave almost no room for interpretation. So yeah, sure those you can exclude, but everything else is fair game, and most of the bible (nearly the whole damn book) is like that, subject to interpretation.
And that is just 1 religious (holy) text. There are many others, including the ones that no one believes in anymore, such as the Enûma Eliš (Enuma Elish) for example.

I do not want to discredit what you say, especially since as a psychologist, (and a good one at that) you have a remarkable ability to see through people, to understand how their minds work, and to 'see behind the mirror' so to speak.
Your view as a psychologist is definitely valuable, but dont think for a second that somehow you've discovered what any other theologian, scholar, or intellectual hasnt discovered.
People have been studying religious texts for a very long time now, some of them have devoted their entire lives to simply understanding what SOME of those texts even mean or what we should believe about them.

What I'm trying to say is, you have your work cut out for you, if you want to enter the realm of religion. 
There are definitely some people out there, that are just brilliant at understanding what people believe and why, people that spend all of their free time just trying to understand how the religious mind works and what people believe, doing formal debates, etc.

 You could definitely benefit from listening to those people, and it could also help you become more rational and pragmatic. 
You certainly seem to be extremely intuitive, but that isnt enough. 
You need structured rational arguments, because empathy and intuition isnt enough, and wont help that much in a formal debate.
Even though you are brilliant, I strongly believe that you would be terrible in a debate about say, the existence of God or the historicity of Jesus. Mainly because most of your positions are practically indefensible, and yes believers will try to take them apart.

  As a final thought, no matter what your critics say, there is no denying that you are in fact a very intelligent person, sometimes I think too intelligent for your own good (not joking, people naturally dont like the ones that deviate from the norm), and to me that is certainly a good thing."

UgjaIiD9UZgQpHgCoAEC,Noah,1503598019927,"Paraphrasing and/or directly quoting this man's wisdom on the topics of drawing meaning through interpretations (i.e. how you should navigate and act throughout life), as well as an analysis on Postmodern thought and Marxist philosopy. 

Around the 35:00-39:00 range.

There are many complex, near infinite, interpretations we can make on objects and life. Scientists developing Artificial Intelligence ran into the problem of the world's complexity, and similarly, Postmodernists chiefly dealt with the issue over interpretation in literature. The word, the sentence, the paragraph, the chapter, and then the chapter within the confines of an entire work, a tradition, or any particular discussion are all susceptible to numerous interpretations. The Postmodern proposition was that there are infinite ways of interpreting a text, and in turn, the world. There is no ""right way"" to do things; people interpret the world in a way that facilitates the acquisition of power. 

WRONG!

You have to extract out from the world a game from your interpretations that you can play. Our aim should be to extract out a set of tools that we can use to function in the world so that we don't suffer too much and so we can attain the things we need in order to continue. For instance, if you extract out from Hamlet that you should kill your family and yourself, that is clearly not a functional interpretation. These interpretations/meanings/tools should be extracted in a way that allows other people to cooperate and compete with us in a peaceful, maintainable way. We have to extract out an interpretation that allow us to live and thrive over multiple periods of time, in multiple environments while we're doing the same thing with other individuals who are motivated the same way. 

The Postmodernists don't care about the constraints placed on our interpretations in order to be functional, so they say you can interpret the world any way you want. All people are ever doing is playing power games based on their identity, and there is no cross-talk between the power hierarchies. Furthermore, dialogue is not allowed because to have a discussion with someone from a perceived superior class, namely cis-gendered, heterosexual, white males, is an evil act in and of itself because engaging in dialogue with them is validating their existence and supposed power game. The idea that two individuals of differing power groups get together, step outside their group identity and have a conversation that leads to a negotiated understanding is incompatible with the Postmodern and Marxist philosophies. 

Not only is the creeping in of Postmodern and Marxist thought been an assault on the substrate of our culture, which is a religious one, but more importantly, it is an assault on everything that has been established since the Enlightenment: rationality, empiricism, science, clarity of mind, dialogue, the idea of the individual. It's to be destroyed just like the Communists wanted the Revolution to destroy the capitalist system. 

This is not to say that every SJW knows or is aware of this grand fact, as not every Muslim or Christian is aware of their own doctrine. The idea is fragmented among people, but when those fragments unite, the philosophy acts itself out."

I hate that too. I hate when you're trying to make a point, and then you know that some jackass is going to try to use what you said against you, so you're forced to stop and try to censor yourself or otherwise try to pre-argue the dumb ass argument you know you're going to be facing, because people can't speak plainly in this society anymore.

UgjLdNfnvWZMDXgCoAEC,goodolarchie,1503598043653,"One thing that I've always found paradoxical (or contradictory) about Peterson is that he advocates for free speech, and not sheltering the truth, even though some amount of sheltering people from the truth (i.e. blatantly being mean, telling white lies etc.) is extremely useful.  Yet his definition of Truth (see his Sam Harris conversation) is that things are useful, archetypes exist and become true because they offer a literary truth.  He is a Christian for this reason, and Sam spent an entire podcast trying to define ""truth"" and come to a common ground.

So you have a guy who values usefulness over intrinsic truth in the universe, but he advocates for truth (and calls a spade a spade) in free speech from the PC Police, even though some around of tone policing is actually useful (i.e. preventing bullying, suicide, etc.).  This juxtaposition baffles me, and his adherence to the Christian ""truth"" devalues many of his assertions."

Of course. And I am feeling emotional at the last 2-minutes of this episode. Be the hero, men. Accept there will always be a snake in the garden, but the garden is worth tending. Understand there is a monster in you, and that you can tame it, and it is worth-while to do so. And for Kek-sake, know that we are not all the same in every way. That is the biggest conversation we need to get back to. Maybe we needed this last half-century to test things out, but let us not pretend anymore that evolution/adaptation did not happen to the various tribes. We can treat people fair without pretending we are all the same. In fact, the only way to treat people fair is to admit nobody is equal to anyone else in most ways."

Ugis94HxJ6clE3gCoAEC,Jay Theyme,1503598055823,"2:40.00 Like Peterson I have a hard time seeing Canadians as more polite because I grew up in Canada. I find Americans are friendlier. Customer service can be better yes. It might be that overall douchebaggery and a-holes are the same BUT Americans express it in outward Obnoxiousness'. Canadians do less of that BUT express it in Passive-Aggressiveness. 
Canadians also have a terrible 'tall poppy syndrome' but its something worse - they cut down the fastest growing new poppy.. before it gets taller! 
Americans are definitely more aggressively competitive BUT they also cheer and support the underdog and launch their champions higher.
But overall I find they are the same for douchebags and assholes and bitches but its just Canadians do it low-key, Americans like to 'go big'. 
(but in fairness, Canada is more monocultural across its board and Peterson is right to compare it to the US 'midwest' and more 'ruralish' whereas the USA actually has huge variations, wide differences. I find their Southern State people fucking amazingly polite, friendly, kind, (way more than Canada on average) BUT holy shit they have some asshole fuckers around Boston.

    I think for a lot of women who passively absorb the default 3rd wave feminist perspective, his perspective is a really hard pill to swallow. They might hear him quickly skip over something about our purpose as child bearers and rearers and turn the video off.  But I wonder what type of woman chooses to stay and listen, as I do?
    I read a book about evolutionary biology a decade ago and couldn't stop talking and thinking about it when I was finished.  It was brilliant stuff to me at the time.

UgjlultOHSupungCoAEC,John Morrison,1503598059953,"Dr. Peterson's first podcast is the only JR podcast that I've listened to in its entirety two times, and Joe and Jordan have the official honour of motivating the last stages of my movement from the moderate left into the political centre ( a few friends and co workers are working on continuing with my right wards drift!)

As a straight, white male, I am still slowly recovering  from an emergence from the insanity of the ultra left mayhem of the Canadian university environment three years ago.

While I still have many strong disagreements with the right, especially on social libertarian issues such as abortion, drug legalization and assisted death, I know can say I equally am in opposition to ideas of the far left such as white privilege and affirmative action and suppression of free speech and thought."

I don't agree with the trend or intent to troll liberal viewpoints, but many who have joined the fun (and it's only fun) are really smart, logical conservatives with good viewpoints in support of Trump. Internet culture is cancerous, but what is also cancerous is to think that internet culture is real culture as you can see from the radical anarchist movements and those who label everyone they disagree with as racists."

'Cultural Marxism' or 'NeoMarxism', DOES NOT EXIST. Peterson makes a lot of good points. Heck, as a person of Left leanings, I agree with most of what he has to say. But I just have a huge problem with whom he's attaching all the blame to. At the very least, he's being very hypocritical with regard to terms of obscurity. Using the term 'Cultural Marxism' or 'Neo-Marxism' is equally nefarious to using 'Ze' or any other of the 30 or more modern gender pronouns. It's just as ridiculous.

His critique is somewhat legitimate but it also as he admits in the beginning of this podcast he actually doesn't have the best understanding of post-modernist philosphy. For example, he's just dead wrong that it took 50 years for ""marxists"" to leave the idea of supporting Marxist government. The Frankfurt School was founded in 1922 just 5 years after the Russian revolution out of revulsion of those Marxist thinkers at the atrocities the Communist government was committing. It's ridiculous to try to claim what he did, Derrida would have been directly aware of the Frankfurt School and while French still came out of that historical development in marxist thought which stands against the authoritarian regimes of Communist governments."

For example, the guy told me he hated my dad, even though he never met him, just because he is a police officer. He told me police act like the have something to prove. He ignorantly hates Trump.

I cant even put into words what I feel. I can barely describe what I'm trying to figure out. in a sense I'm trying to figure out what life is supposed to mean to us. is life supposed to mean anything? if not, why the hell are we here? and probably the most insane question is why do we have emotions? what purpose do emotions have in our life? why would evolution give us emotions? it doesn't seem like they provide anything in our lives other than worsening our overall experiences, which could be debated as good or bad anyways since everything is relative to the person.(the second part of that last sentence basically refutes the first part.) I would also assume that getting closer into my beliefs of what life really means, I would have to ask myself what are emotions I like to feel. by now I feel like if I delve any deeper into the unknown I think I will become more insane than i already am.  sometimes I think being a little insane is just being outside of the realm of what most normal people can mentally handle. this being the realm of which revolutionizes the society of the human race, and all other races. but then I go back to the question of why does this all matter? if our universe is to just disappear in our relative distant future then why would any of this matter? why not just end our lives now? then comes the depression. but then the emotions of people I care about and even physical things I care about come into play. all of this seems like an endless circle which I cant fucking understand. why the fuck have we been created without knowing what our existence is supposed to be? are we really here to just do nothing? then you can try to bring in science, the most horrific thing that has ever been surmised. (to me saying that science is able to be surmised in itself is a paradox, and also quite insane, but shit I don't know hat else to say.) as Peterson said, this is one of the tools that humans use to justify what we do in war. yet there could be an infinite way of describing ways this is good and bad using a scientific way of thinking, and also infinite ways of describing this as good or bad using an emotional way of thinking. I think I'm insane, please disregard this as I don't think any of this made any sense. but I will say that I understand that joe is bringing up these topics because of how other people have reacted to perterson's talks and such, yet I do not think this is the limitations of Peterson's mind. I would give him the respect of going deeper. let the man reach as far as he can, and stop limiting him to these idiotic talking points."

Also, are there stats available in regards to the medications these kids are on? I'm sure I don't need to explain the damage that can be done by a wrongly prescribed psych med. It could be possible that they are being overprescribed psych meds. 
If an obese woman can get her doctor in trouble for suggesting weight loss out of a genuine health concern, it isn't a stretch to see that a kid, burdened by many modern elements, has developed a social malaise and is being incorrectly treated. Is it a stretch to hypothesize that a kid with La Nausée, who has been manipulated by the social justice promotors of victimhood to identify with a mental illness, has been convinced to take whatever medication is en vogue? 
Could it be that, secretly, doctors are afraid to refuse medicating their young, confused patients (who would benefit more from CBT) out of fear that if they don't they will be in professional trouble for discrimination or xxxphobia?

But the thing is, it's got legs of its own.  

The moment that you begin with a philosophy that says things like ""Well, all distinctions that we could possible make (or judgements) are inherently flawed, since there's an infinite number of interpretations for what we see...""

You BEGIN this philosophy with the notion that there is no such thing as ""judgement"" or ""identification"" or even ""justice""... because, hey, what does the word ""just"" even mean?  It's all up for grabs... but as Jordan also said, the goal is destruction.

I've engaged with people to ask a question as simple as ""Do you believe in 'right' and 'wrong'?""  And it's really shocking to find that so many of a generation will basically tell you ""No"".  Because they see it as just entrapment into that whole ""power game"".

UgiWQEuu8h-piXgCoAEC,Courtney Valdez,1503598137189,"As a writer, I'm well aware of Derrida's (and the slew of French philosophers of the mid-20th Century) horrible influence on literature. I actually love postmodern literature as works of art, but I'm fundamentally opposed to theory except in VERY specific cases where a work was purposely written with the tenants of said theory in mind. Even then, I don't buy into the theory itself, but it's at least appropriate to use it to understand the work. Unfortunately, theory has, in many ways, replaced the actual literature as the focus of literary scholarship. I'm working to enter into academia in order to bring the study and appreciation of literature to the texts themselves and away from circular (and often pseudo-intellectual) philosophical ideology. Theory is, in many ways, the death of art in literature. I would elaborate on that, but I could write whole books on this topic and I'm tired now after writing all day.

And yes, religion IS superstition. If you're talking about religion as the fantasy tales about magic sky wizards, then yes, it is all superstition. However, there is a lot to discover in religion, as a nonbeliever, if you're looking into the historical and philosophical and psychological and anthropological elements of the tales and how they function and why they function. Still superstition. Still bullshit. I know Mr. Peterson is a religious person and even though I'm an atheist I really do appreciate his perspective on religion (philosophically at least), but no, returning to religion--however you want to define ""return""--is not going to save civilization. We are not going to solve climate change and world hunger and cancer and intergalactic travel through religion."

1)  Western culture has been influenced by feminism which has told men that they are childish, selfish, incompetant, lazy, rapists, ... whereas women are nurturing, caring, empathetic, ...   So here comes Jordan saying that you can become a hero and here's how you do it.   It's not the women who are hungry for that message.  They already have people like Oprah telling them that.   It's the men who are hungry for it.

2)  It's mostly men who are interested in philosophy in general and not women."

It's their life, who are you (or anyone for that matter) to say the way they choose to live it is wrong? Some people don't want to conform to the standards of the society around them.

The entire debate is centered on if those statutes are in conflict and if not how that would operate on this ban and if they are which one takes supremacy which is not as clear cut as one being newer. So basically Yates just spurted out partisan talking points rather than any legal fact and Cruz largely did the same which is not a take down."

You have the power to stop these idiots if you so choose and the even bigger issue is the lack of action by good people.

Ugji9fio-DPn1ngCoAEC,ModernPlague,1503598190985,"GREAT podcast.  This is JRE at its best.  I've listened to hours & hours of Jordan Peterson's lectures.  But I do wish he's spend a little more time talking about the unfair aspects of our economic system----in this interview, he basically says that 18-year-olds should get their shit together instead of bitching about the financial system, and there's a lot of truth to that, but the problem is that, every year, our financial system is making it harder for those very people to get their shit together. 

 It used to be a lot easier to find a niche and work your way up, but now people are barely able to support themselves with these increasingly shitty, unstable jobs.  And even Peterson himself has said that it's getting harder & harder to recommend college.  The problem with NOT bitching about our financial system is that it's creating such a disproportion of wealth that people are becoming hopeless, confused, and desperate---and thus more likely to seek extreme ideologies like Marxism/communism.  

If we only focus on Social Justice Warriors bitching about gender pronouns, wealth inequality will lead to even more severe problems in the long run.  And if students have no right to bitch since their lives are so comfy compared to the rest of the world (which is true), and that level of comfort is enough to be content with, then shouldn't we ask ourselves why the mega-millionaires & billionaires can't be content with what THEY have?  The average American's standard of living has been dropping since the '70s----the top 10th of the top 1% have been making all the economic gains in the last decade or so.  There are over 400 Billionaires in the U.S.  

As Peterson has said in one of his lectures, a system that becomes extremely unfair and offers no hope to struggling people runs the risk of those desperate people deciding to burn down the whole system rather than let it continue.  So I wish Peterson would spend more  time acknowledging extreme wealth disparities and the shrinking of the middle class, because this is an even bigger threat to a fair, functioning social system than SJWs and their stupid gender pronouns."

Yes, a free and open society can happily have the Petersons of the world make all the self-important noises and hysterics, visions of doom and evil forces lurking amongst serpents, dragons, frogs, feminist husbands, the under-world, Jung, oncoming end of civilization, yadayada...  What as strange mess.  Just don't go to him for 'therapy', because you may not make it under the dark load of his end-time gospel."

I ended up getting in to the talk with a few other people.. In that audience there were open transgender people and a few Trump hats. Everything was civil. Not one heckle!

This is the same University campus where Ann Coulter gave a speech back in 2010 without incident. Hostile audience for sure, but she was allowed to speak. No protests. NO violence.

OK Mom.

But the clearest sign of an Evangelist is the DOOMSAYING, everything is going to send us to hell! Did I miss it or did someone mention that Preachers have been predicting one trivial blip after another means ""The End Is Near! Chaos!

UgjvUDBnz5AuTXgCoAEC,Herry Spinkernail,1503598215695,It comes down to the chicken or the egg paradox if you don't believe in a creator than it must've been that humans created these systems in order to explain and maneuver most efficiently through life and it's struggles and rewards and most of all Christianity being a way that is most efficient and effective at reaching the most enlightened benevolent goal and that's even if you don't believe in God so this what he says makes alot of sense and how I like to explain why Christianity is almost fundamental in the metaphysical aspect of societies psychoreality  or at least it's fundamental values and objectives but is that something we came up with many years ago or were programmed from outside influence? This is what they ponder and it doesn't necessarily answer said questions only opens doors for what then could be a new understanding of our life's purpose and meaning. He has an objective and very sound fact based presentation very open to debate which shows that he has the intellect to have a very sensible argument and or opinion based on some good research but only scratches the surface. The TRANSHUMANISM movement is being pushed because it is an end goal at us transcending our limitations through breaking our code genetically and breaking the confines of our world and penetrating the walls that separate the different dimensions through changing our genes and our foundation humans could transcend beyond limitations so it starts with sociopsychological rewiring of what we understand as the foundation of biology and moves to research through experimentation and implementation as society breaks down there comes a new enlightenment they say which enables the society to work as one mind being the most powerful ( WhICH has underlying communist type ideology ) WICH differs from Christianity in that we believe God loves us for who we r and we need not become something else to transcend our bodies are finite our souls are forever so that's the important part to preserve and modify towards benevolence which is the most efficient path and hans death is the pathe for the soul to reunite in Gods light and become one with him  TRANsHUMANISM cult on the other hand tries to accomplish something like this with their own hands not wanting help from God.    the frog represents the interconnecting force of separate interdimentional metaphysical understandings of reality   and this enlightenment of the duality of our nature shows us how clearly real good and evil are dark and light so he has very valid and objective points to make and is not necessarally attacking Christianity but questioning how humans came to know what they do at least he's trying to think critically and has alot more intellect than so called scientists psychologists and Joe has a good platform for objective debate that's all people want that'd be why the huge following he needs to keep it up because even if people disagree they want to still see the debate and have the freedom of thought

I'd love it if they had brought a competent proponent of communism or post-modern philosophy to debate. If Jordan is right, they'd break down quick because the very notion of dialog is defeat...

I keep hearing some people talk about Christianity positively and I really have a hard time seeing it.  I read the bible and it seems like all the same stuff repeated over and over.  Here is the bible in a nutshell, ""Believe in God, you will be saved, your problems will be solved. The non believing enemies will be destroyed.  Jesus died (for you apparently).  For some reason that makes you 'saved'.  Believe or perish.""  I am still waiting to be exposed to this apparently hidden part of the bible where it talks about something actually substantive, like truth.  Where does it talk about anything except faith?  I look forward to Jordan's talks on the bible starting May 16.  

2:09:15 And as to the story of Jesus, I also miss the part where he is actually like a normal person who goes through the hero's journey.   OK, yes he certainly did go through the process of accepting death and yes that is a hell of a thing and yes it certainly forces anyone to face their demons.  But ultimately, it's all just delusion.  He seemed to literally believe he had super powers and was the all powerful manifestation of God.  That's not truth man.... it was an absurd ego that persists and millions believe in it millions to this day.  It's ridiculous now and ridiculous then.  Why do we need to talk about that again?  I'm waiting to hear the part about the bible that we should actually listen to and is grounded in realistic thinking."

UghKM475pQBiq3gCoAEC,Steven Nodlehs,1503598220329,"I feel that this ridiculous far-left agenda is another game being played by the elites so that far-right legislation can be passed by right-wing politicians such as Trump and his Republican party and the Tories in the UK. We are being manipulated by people with hundreds of billions of petrodollars into giving away more of our dwindling human rights. And I'll concur - as a gay man I feel like this 'gender-bender movement' has nothing to do with me and doesn't represent my views at all. The hardest thing I have to deal with is people not accepting that I'm gay because I have two (now adult) biological children and their intrusive questions.

If people want to go around defining everything themselves by what they have sex with, then we'd all be handsexuals transitioning towards their inevitable decayed future where none of this will matter - after 80 men and women kinda look the same and hardly anything works. Kinda explains why this gender-bending fad is only being enacted by immature bits of kids, backed up by middle age men in suits (who make their living pushing this agenda). Somehow they don't see the contradiction?!?

The reason for it is the same general reason behind the overt embrace of fascist symbology and language in other sectors of the population. We are not so much right and left anymore as we are anti-left and anti-right. There are hierarchies and prestige and purity norms within both circles, and what better way to advertise one's anti-x bona fides than to proudly flaunt the symbols of the most extreme and triggering version of the other side?

He then states that it is anti intellectual to avoid dialogue with someone of an opposing viewpoint, I agree with this. But he seems to imply that everyone must consider every idea or stance while at the same time claiming that only certain ones are legitimate, why would someone with a legitimate idea/interpretation have to enter into dialogue with someone of an illegitimate idea/interpretation? Should only two people with legitimate ideas/interpretations enter into debate? Is there only one interpretation and if so can there be any dialogue or debate?"

It's all in the heart man"
UggYZYRwSPYr4ngCoAEC,Hari,1503598242258,"The problem Jorden is that your 'God' is only a concept of human imagination like Harry Potter and or Darth Vader where The Bible is like Shakespeare's work or Hemingway's Old man and the sea, just any other literary work from which meaning could be drawn. The reason why we have terms is because we can understand things in the real world and to communicate with others thoughts. We know 'Captain America' is a imaginary character made for entertainment and from which you could  abstract meaning and when you say 'God' and regard him as a imaginary character too, just know that 92% of the population don't, that's the problem. The term God has special  characteristics that make them different than comic book heros like say 'The Hulk'.  
 For starters God is thought to be real (How many Christians or Muslims in the third world believe that their God is a myth, that's right, none) 
God is systematically protected from criticism and discussion, a cartoon of Captain America gets you some bucks where one about God gets your head chopped off  in some places,  a burning of comic book is a waste of paper  where as a book of God almost put US-Afghan relations in peril. Am I they only one who thinks these differences are just too significant to put Jordan's vague interpretation of God and my neighbour's solid interpretation of God together and force people pretend they are the same is severely misguided way to approach the issue . A child is not associated with Harry Potter or Spiderman at birth rather  Children are called a Christian or a Muslim when they are born, a girl's genitals are cut up because of their association to an imaginary character in some places. There's a difference between what Jorden means when he says 'God' and what everyone one else means when they say God.     
I don't find Jorden's way of looking at the    the matter very persuasive however his experience as a clinical psychologist really shows up when he speaks. Personally I find his talks very useful"

The last hour or so is gold. It truly outlines the root of all current discord. The inability of recognizing who we are and the realization that there is no positive without negative. I wish his approach to the gender pronoun battle would also point out that is just too early to pretend to know the why of gender insecure people. Let alone making decisions on how to address them as a law in a misguided quest for fairness and equality.

This was at the age of sixteen. I completely dismissed him as an overrated charlatan as a teen. That was my introduction to 'post-modernism,' having brought myself up on real, solid, classic literature. It's a load of shite, end of story. It's just obvious eternal problems that you can find discussed nobly and manfully dealt with in Plato overblown into hysterical imbalance and torturous, nihilistic writhing that goes nowhere and means nothing. I was literally slapping my brow in astonishment that somebody who said absolutely nothing positive whatsoever is even seriously entertained as a major literary figure. So frustrating. The post-modernists are like flies battening on shit. They do nothing but feed on the negative. They have nothing positive to say; they are effectively useless for all practical human purposes. They are at best pretentiously 'bookish,' and that is all. They are completely ignorant of reality; they just communicate in rambling intellectual jargon and literary platitudes spun out into the most ridiculous waffling inanity imaginable.

UgjLwjnlYAoQo3gCoAEC,Basekitball,1503598272372,"The truth works in weird ways. Most of what Dr. Peterson and Joe said seemed obvious, but for some reason it was like it was laying dormant inside of me and I was rationalizing it, hiding from it, or what have you.

I think I realize what Dr. Peterson was saying about intellectuals. For a man of action, he becomes the change he wants to see in the world. Not that he isn't also a sophisticated person, but instead of preaching change to others, he acts it out(and then maybe preach when the log is removed from his own eye - to help out his brother, not for vanity.) This process is to put your money where your mouth is, so to speak. It not only puts the responsibility on yourself, but it's a sort of reality check aswell. 

I think that is the missing key, atleast for me. I have to become the change I want to see in the world. Instead of complaining about societal atomization, I have to take the effort to connect with my family. Instead of complaining about sexual norms, I need to act out my beliefs on male-female relationships and the proper perspective on material sexual gratification. Instead of complaining about advertisements and tv, I have to disconnect from the system and try to limit my sources of information to good sources (while still trying to get outside of my bubble a bit).

Also, I've heard a saying that in a fight between meek men and barbarians, the barbarians always win. Thus, it is the responsibility of civilized men to be capable of violence and self defense, not for the sake of sadism, but to protect the beautiful. In some ways our society has failed by not inspiring our men, because beauty has been stomped out of modern life in a lot of ways. But partly because men are taught that all violence is bad and they should be meek. Both seem to be a recipe for disastor. I know the idea of a iron fist in a velvet glove is a good metaphor for the violent, but civilized man. This was the story of Sir Lancelot.

Thats my path atleast. I really liked scrolling through some of the comments here, and maybe someone will find value in mine. We got to turn this boat around (or atleast course correct) and take on the responsibility of western civilization. Economics isn't everything, our forefathers weren't stupid, beauty and virtue is important, family is important, and truth is of most importance."

I could be wrong, but my understanding of memetics is that it is a structuring of thought or arrangement of neural pathways which can be transferred from mind to mind. In essence, any transferable idea is a meme. The individual doesn't act as a neuron, the individual is a holder and disperser of a memetic code. Just like a member of a species isn't acting as a gene, rather they hold a majority of their genes in common with their group and, in turn, propagate their best facsimile of that groups shared genes."

That said, I would have loved a more honest commentary of the ""mansplaining"" meme. I appreciate the cheeky ad absurdum dig at feminists, as long as people understand the underlying problem that people actually deal with.

When one person refuses to Receive (chalice) the perspective or rationality of another, and chooses only to Give (phallus) of their own perspective and logic - THAT'S mansplaining, and it's extremely annoying. I've started to refer to it as mind-rape, since it's a violent struggle to get a word in with a mansplainer.

So when a guy is blindly determined to convince his partner that she's wrong because he's addicted to the submission of a woman (agreeable people are easy to subjugate),  he could instead try listening to her perspective and reasoning. He could address them without talking over her every syllable. He could stop violently shoving his own explanations into the vessel that doesn't want him. Then he'd earn enough respect to be listened to instead of being dismissed as a ""mansplainer"". These people are out there, and I wager that it happens at least once in every hetero relationship. If the important thing is family, this would certainly make them stronger!

Would love to see a clinical study of how either gender listens vs pontificates."

UgjNGyOFBvY7RXgCoAEC,Gortume,1503598279785,"I love hearing Jordan speak and I am no post-modernist but Jordan's arguments are all over the place here. Is his central argument that post-modernists hold no value in the individual or that it doesn't exist? As he says, ""There's no individual for god's sake!"" Well he goes on to make the critique that the natural product of the post-modern/new wave feminist doctrine is that the marginalized group can be delineated on and on and on until each individual is recognized as marginalized and that that is in some way chaotic (although easily you can make the argument that we have always had a society where each individual is a composite of their marginalized/hero vs. marginalizer/snake stories). 

Or is his central argument that the post-modernists believe, as he mentions as pertaining to the evolution of Marxism, that society is broken up into oppressed vs. oppressor and that is as far as that will go and can only change in the subjects of the comparison? That would seem very consistent with his proclamations of the natural development and organization of human societies into categories of good vs. evil or as I quoted before, the hero vs. the snake. It would seem to me then that you could easily frame the social justice warrior male allies as being, in their own way, the hero against the snake which in this case would be whoever they deem to be responsible for their and their community's unrest. The same would apply to all of the social justice warrior types, they immediately fall into the very categories that Jordan took as true and omnipotent.

I'm not exactly sure why Jordan isn't able to acknowledge that the products of evolution as he sees it, in terms of navigating our dominance hierarchy or identifying threats in a group (most interestingly his example of human's amazing ability to see that the ""snake"" in individuals is somehow the same one across all evil individuals), doesn't apply to the very group he is talking about. I would like clarification on this and I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts about this."

To these three might be added physical pursuits -in any event self-betterment would be the incentive but self betterment truly aligned with social betterment.

The irony here is that Joe and Jordan are sitting here on their second 3 hour discussion of being offended and playing the victim from the fact that some people don't feel they fit into a gender binary and yet their criticism is that the other folks are whining.  It might not make sense to these ding dongs, but some folks just don't fit into the roles that are defined by society and this is their way of expressing it.

UggPFicYHb_-IHgCoAEC,Todd Tharp,1503598313269,"The revolt against reason, the characteristic mental attitude of our age, was not caused by a lack of modesty, caution, and self-examination on the part of the philosophers. Neither was it due to failures in the evolution of modern natural science. The amazing achievements of technology and therapeutics speak a language which nobody can ignore. It is hopeless to attack modern science, whether from the angle of intuitionism and mysticism, or from any other point of view. The revolt against reason was directed against another target. It did not aim at the natural sciences, but at economics. The attack against the natural sciences was only the logically necessary outcome of the attack against economics. It was impermissible to dethrone reason in one field only and not to question it in other branches of knowledge also.

The great upheaval was born out of the historical situation existing in the middle of the nineteenth century. The economists had entirely demolished the fantastic delusions of the socialist utopians. The deficiencies of the classical system prevented them from comprehending why every socialist plan must be unrealizable; but they knew enough to demonstrate the futility of all socialist schemes produced up to their time. The communist ideas were done for. The socialists [p. 74] were absolutely unable to raise any objection to the devastating criticism of their schemes and to advance any argument in their favor. It seemed as if socialism was dead forever.

Only one way could lead the socialists out of this impasse. They could attack logic and reason and substitute mystical intuition for ratiocination. It was the historical role of Karl Marx to propose this solution. On the basis of Hegel's dialectic mysticism, he blithely arrogated to himself the ability to predict the future. Hegel pretended to know that Geist, in creating the universe, wanted to bring about the Prussian monarchy of Frederick William III. But Marx was better informed about Geist's plans. He knew that the final cause of historical evolution was the establishment of the socialist millennium. Socialism is bound to come ""with the inexorability of a law of nature."" And as, according to Hegel, every later stage of history is a higher and better stage, there cannot be any doubt that socialism, the final and ultimate stage of mankind's evolution, will be perfect from any point of view. It is consequently useless to discuss the details of the operation of a socialist commonwealth. History, in due time, will arrange everything for the best. It does not need the advice of mortal men.

There was still the main obstacle to overcome: the devastating criticism of the economists. Marx had a solution at hand. Human reason, he asserted, is constitutionally unfitted to find truth. The logical structure of mind is different with various social classes. There is no such thing as a universally valid logic. What mind produces can never be anything but ""ideology,"" that is, in the Marxian terminology, a set of ideas disguising the selfish interests of the thinker's own social class. Hence, the ""bourgeois"" mind of the economists is utterly incapable of producing more than an apology for capitalism. The teachings of ""bourgeois"" science, an offshoot of ""bourgeois"" logic, are of no avail for the proletarians, the rising class destined to abolish all classes and to convert the earth into a Garden of Eden.

But, of course, the logic of the proletarians is not merely a class logic. ""The ideas of proletarian logic are not party ideas, but emanations of logic pure and simple.""2 Moreover, by virtue of a special privilege, the logic of certain elect bourgeois is not tainted with the original sin of being bourgeois. Karl Marx, the son of a well-to-do lawyer, married to the daughter of a Prussian noble, and his collaborator Frederick Engels, a wealthy textile manufacturer, never doubted that they themselves were above the law and, notwithstanding their bourgeois background, were endowed with the power to discover absolute truth. [p. 75]

It is the task of history to describe the historical conditions which made such a crude doctrine popular. Economics has another task. It must analyze both Marxian polylogism and the other brands of polylogism formed after its pattern, and expose their fallacies and contradictions.

However, he seriously lacks an understanding of Postmodernism and the intentions of Postmodernist thinkers. I would recommend everyone read the thinkers themselves and come to your own conclusion because Dr. Peterson's view, in my opinion, is uncharitable and superficial. His interpretation is wholly negative and skews very broad thinkers into a narrow corridor. There is much to criticize in Postmodernism but this boarders on straw man argumentation."

Ugh16CRmGZBxuXgCoAEC,tragicslip,1503598322842,"about Sally v Ted the Reckoning: 

if the courts policed executive power equally, regardless of executive branch's political affiliation, that would be great. 

Sally was fired not because courts opposed Trumps travel bans BUT because she would not argue that 8 US code 1182 takes precedent over the Immigration and Nationality Act. That is her job as attorney general and considering Sally did not have any problem with Obama policies that relied on 8 US code 1182 for legality in spite of INA, firing her seems like a reasonable action. 

this is like a prosecutor not doing their job because of who is pressing charges rather than considering the strength of the case against the defendant. 

equal protection and due process is not something courts have granted non citizens. see Guantanamo. so her constitutional concerns are completely unfounded as far as the Supreme Court is concerned. 

so yeah, her body language and her delivery are pure ownage. BUT any understanding of 1: her responsibilities as attorney general, 2: constitutional law (precedent) expose this for what it is - a tacit admission of dereliction of duty."

Both versions contained a severe eye irritant as a warning agent, neither had an odorificant.

Yes, Peterson is a knowledgable man, but he is also driven by motivation, values and emotions like everyone else. I lost a lot of respect for Joe after he had Alex Jones on the show. The internet + the market = the breeding of stupidity. These guests are invited because of the controversy only and for the amount of clicks they bring in. Joe knows what he is doing.

Go back a couple hundred years and look at what Christianity made the world into. Maybe as philosophy Christianity is more than just superstition but I have a really hard time accepting that it's been a force for good in the world. Maybe my knowledge of history isn't up to snuff but as far as I know the West started to get good right around the time people stopped making Christianity the central focus in life and started thinking about other things. Christianity had centuries of time to work and what did it do? It put the final nail in the coffin of a once great empire and plunged a Continent into darkness. The Enlightenment and secularism are to thank for the great life we live, not Christianity. As an ideology it's not clear to me that it's any better for humanity than communism."

Other people Bill pardoned helped Hilary's senate campaign and Puerto Rico got it. Read up on the FALN. Read up on the democratic senators who Bill Pardoned the last hour who had TWELVE counts of sexual assault, mail fraud, extortion, and child pornography! Read up on Marc Rich who IS the %1 who fled the US when tax evasion charges were filled against him. Who didn't pay FOURTYFIVE MILLION dollars in taxes!!! Then his wife gave millions and millions of dollars to Hilary Clinton's senate campaign and to the Clinton library (which is is a scam) and the Clinton Foundation (which is an even bigger scam). Go read up on Susan McDougal who was part of the Whitewater scandal and was held on contempt for refusing to testify about the Clinton's role. Go ahead people.

And here's another thing that most people don't even understand..... getting a mate to have sex isn't even necessarily primarily about attraction.  It's crazy but true.  What I mean is, a woman can be massively attracted to a guy, but that doesn't necessarily mean she goes home with the guy she likes most.  Game is the process of actually moving a girl from one step to another, ultimately leading to sex as the last  step.  The woman will have sex with whoever is better at moving her around.  And that really sucks if you're not so good at getting quick compliance, and a lot of times I really wish women would just go ahead and choose their own mate of their own choice.  But I feel like a lot of times, they don't even choose.  They go with whoever TAKES them first.  They go with whoever makes it seem like it's not a choice.... like ""it just happened"".  Yeah sure, that way of being has its advantages, but it's also retarded and frustrating in other ways."

UgiMvMMewVEWR3gCoAEC,Jarrett Steuerwald,1503598354226,"Here is a good example, imo. I am a male, during early high school years I seriously thought about if I was gay if i wanted to be a cross dresser, literally everything. And I have seen the parts of my souls on many trips and i know there is a female feline as one of them. during those trips i realized what im given physically by complete chance and chemical compounds, there is absolutely nothing natural i can do to the change that. and the parts of my conscious that were feminine were more attributed towards my bubbly attitude like when im in a good mood, instead of sexually towards males. if anything the feminine side made and makes me more attracted to females. part of it is because my parents never talked about it like that and could joke an poke fun at gays,(back then there was only gay and straight so don't pc me) so I didn't have it embedded into my brain that it was a very okay option. (unlike the kids with a younger generation of parents <mine are 53 and 55 right now>) also, a lot of the times I felt more gay and maybe wanted to be with a cute boy in my class is when i wasn't getting that kind of attention from a girl. it'd make me depressed not having a companion around so id just eventually open my option to the same sex. and at 15 it was romantic feelings for the same sex, but as a grew older it became more sexual and less romantic. to the point i don't find mindful pleasure{ At this point I realized i had a dream the other night about typing this out.} at all with the same sex. it almost turns me off nowadays thinking about it. i feel like as i was growing and becoming less depressed, so  then the less i stopped being desperate for companionship, and channeled it into feeling more for a woman emotionally. so that makes me think i was really only sexually and or romantically attracted to the same sex because i wanted to feel like i fit in to even more than the places i already fit in. then that made me realize that kids younger than me these days are told it is very okay to be depressed or have this or that mentally wrong with you, so they take it to the max and really play the part as depressed or bipolar, i did the exact same thing as a growing teen but wasn't told that it was an okay thing at all, that yeah there is things that can help but really you just gotta suck it the fuck up and enjoy what you've got. so now i realize that a lot of the kids these days start out depressed, they see how bubbly and cool they are when they feel 'gay', then take off with it. telling everyone they're gay and how proud they are. and completely lose sight of who they really are. people and teens should not be proud to feel like themselves for coming out about being gay, instead just humble and proud that they are themselves first. and then they're sexually attracted to another sex. gay or whatever. gay doesn't define you, you define gay."

Also his jabbering on about Archetypes, which at one point entranced me, are not founded in any sort of objectively proven theory, it's just bad philosophy upon which he builds with his own wisdom. Which is funny because he even admits that there is an multiplicity of ways of interpreting a story, then expects you to believe his version is the ""right way to think about it"".

UggpDHn8DfW-Y3gCoAEC,AsGiants Astros,1503598374988,"I think what most philosophical people like Joe & Jordan miss is that most of the violence during protests (like at Berkeley) isn't due to an ideology or rooted in some sort of short-circuit where otherwise normal people become violent because of an ideological belief.

Most violence at protests, at least now in America it seems, are violent/unstable/angry people that want to commit violence, and so use protests as a vehicle to inflict it without consequences.  So there's really not much use imo in analyzing the ""why"" question like Joe & Jordan, who bring in all these historical & philosophical references in an attempt to understand and extrapolate a larger sense of meaning from these events.  They approach the situation, to their credit, from their own perspective.  And it causes them great pain and confusion to imagine and analyze the cause-and-effect relationship between ideology and violence.  They are too focused on the connection between the logical step from ideology to atrocity, when really there might just be atrocity and the attempts of the person/people that committed it to justify it under some framework.

Overall, I think they give too much credit to humanity; some people are in a mentally unhinged and just want to inflict violence, and doing it under the guise of some ideology allows them to do it in an avenue where it will be blamed on ""the Left"" instead of on themselves and their own unbalanced state."

Postmodernists are nihilists who want to break down structures and ruin boundaries because they are resentful that other people live happy lives within those categories and they don't, so tear them down. This is social engineering with a desire to play God and erase the  definitions of what normal people agree is objective reality (eg. there are only 2 genders). Scientists study ""reality"" which is the material or natural world. Religious people also accept this ""reality"" that the scientists study and call it God's creation. So they are on the same page. But the postmodernist rejects this world that God made and dare to play God themselves by remaking society out of whole cloth Orwell-style. This is social engineering by bitter people to enact their power over others.  I thank Jordan Peterson for being one of the only people out there both able and willing to articulate what is really going on - the transgender debate really is about something much deeper."

All of Jordan Peterson's arguments are logical sound and reasonable, his effortlessness in conveying his truth as opposed to his opposition is evident of the Truth he has to offer. To think the majority of human beings or that there are human beings on a large scale who have psychological issues untreated have made their way into brick and mortar edifices called ""Academia"" is plausible and real.

It's not something people are necessarily doing consciously. Teenage girls do this, for instance, and it's not like it's because they're hatching a conscious conspiracy. 

But that's what it's about, relational aggression and control, making you prove you're not a monster and putting you on the defensive so they can control the social interaction.  Implicit within all this is the basic assumption that you're a monster until you prove otherwise. It's persecution politics.

The idea that Cruz and Yates had a street fighter style showdown from which Cruz limped away is just silly. Cruz is part of a committee attempting to uncover the truth. As things stand so far we know that Yates knew that the EO was legal. We know that she disagreed with it because she inferred that Trumps intention was improper. That's a pretty big reach right there. When we take into account that the EO, however clumsy, was to protect Americans and that the democrats want open borders to reinforce their voter base, then Cruz has done enough to allow us to infer that Yates acted out of partisanship instead of principle.

I dont give a fuck about SJW's or people who call other people SJW's.  The internet has created a safe place for all of you.  I wish I could smack the fuck out of most of you for some of the bullshit we have to endure.

 Don't fucking lie to yourselves.  Joe has no right having some of these conversations because he is not prepared or even based in reality sometimes.  He completely freaked on his friend Eddie recently cuz Eddie's thoughts are surreal at times and Joe often has bizarre opinions without much research either.  No he is not fucking dumb.  But he is a fucking panderer & often bullshits his way through convos.   He's been pandering to all sides and you can try and twist it and say he's being considerate to all sides cuz he wants to be an every mans man.  Nah.  It seems he often panders.  Consider him the sales associate you call a credit card company to complain to.  I want to speak to his supervisor.  I think its because of the evolution of the podcast going from just shooting the shit to non-consequential issues that are truly meaningless  to so many people in the world and are only perpetuated by those who profit off of the proliferation of discussion that most of us crave.  Some of you dudes are actually as crazy as Eddie Bravo when you talk about viewership numbers and Youtube suppressing this video.  You guys are fucking sick.   But the problem with many of you guys who like having political conversations dont listen to anybody else.  You either pander or propaganda.  Pander or Propaganda.  You fucking pencil necked geeks ruin conversations and countries.

You fucking shitheads have ruined this podcast.  Ruined it.  It use to be fun to listen to Rogan podcast when he knew he was a bullshit artist just shooting the shit with his friends, googling everything he knows & fellow comedians & Entertainment colleagues bringing intrigue.  Rogan gets rid of Redban because he said it messed with the flow of the conversations and it made for a more streamlined experience between just Joe & his guests.  We all know that Joe is not the fucking genius that you super fans think he is.  Watch him around other funny comedians.  He can barely come up with intelligent remarks except repetitive statements or references.  Watch his podcast with Jeff Ross & Greg Fitzsimmons they did with other guests at some Comedy Club.

How easy is it to bring up a vague reference and then not even be able to intelligently discuss it.while then asking someone to the side to google the gaps.

IF he wants to go this route than do something more than talk about SJWs repeatedly?  Give me a fucking break you boring cunts. He and his educational system helped to create these kind of problems.  Help solve the fact that higher edcuation is increasing at currently 8% more than inflation annually so real people can get in there instead of the children of middle class, upper middle class, rich who have helped to perpetuate this cultural hegemony. 

 Joe would rather discuss what to call transgenders and how to skin a bear instead of bringing on nonpartisan guests to consistently, sincerely highlight or discuss homelessness, public education, unemployment, human trafficking, Modern Bureaucratic Political systems.  When is the podcast going to have deep long convos about how to solve this issue.  Or the rape of children all over the middle east.  So we went from shooting the shit to talking about other Youtube podcasts needing attention to discuss SJW's, transgenders & repetitive topics.  The internet has created a forum for all of us to criticize each other & think that our opinions are welcomed.  I know my opinion won't be accepted by certain people.  But I'm okay with that.  I paid my money to be able to  waste my time typing this."

But I gotta say that high IQ isn't everything, it's not experience, especially the experience of people who have real problems that are unfair to them. They should be allowed to speak and be taken seriously if they are being honest. But seems that if you don't have a high IQ, people like Peterson seem to believe you are a fool to speak, go clean your room first, fix yourself first. I know that he has said in the past that he encourages people to speak their mind and that he is for free speech, but he also insinuates that if he considers you mentally inferior, you're dumb to speak.

The self-knowledge Jung speaks about is that of true nature of thinking that all people have.  The idea is to identify oneself in the originality and individualism that one creates.  Connect oneself with the “shadow” and understand it.  Bring the shadow to light to expose it to one’s conscious and let them grow to become a one-consciousness mind.The development of humankind is flourishing every day and the feeling of insignificance is overwhelming with the amount of population.  However if one can grasp the ideas of equality, the gain of self-knowledge, and rid their life of class-divisions, then one will be at peace with who they are as a person. In order to live in a mass-mentality culture one must learn how to function in one by learning from the rest of the populous; In order to live an original life, one must free from the mass- mentality, recognize the symbolic nature of manipulation, while remaining within the culture’s sense of ethics."

I don't think Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins totally disregard the usefulness of some biblical or religious stories. I think their objection mostly is when religion is used as a tool to be detrimental, such as not teaching evolution or killing people in the name of the religion. The idea that some people actually believe that stories in the bible or koran are physically and actually true, such as turning water to wine, splitting the sea with a staff, etc. You can still keep the archetypes from the bible and religious stories, which is what Peterson is describing here. He says that archetypes are useful and essential to humans. And I agree with him. But you can also take the positives and leave behind the useless ideas. Peterson said himself that several books, such as the Hobbit, display these archetypes, etc. But nobody in their right mind believes that the stories in the Hobbit are actually true."

UggblwugyUPvfXgCoAEC,DarthYuYevon,1503598429930,"Great video, love these guys!!!!! One big thing I got out of this, and it's because I'm borderline retarded, is that Jordan believes that Transgenders represent chaos which means they are a negative for society(even though earlier in the video he says he has no problem with trans people), and the men who aren't the typical alpha male who can compete well in society and win easily by getting the women etc are failures especially the male feminists, that all male feminists are slime balls, and the women who can't compete well who feel weakened by common society are also a cancer of society( I picture lesbian feminists with man hate agenda's). 
.
Also, everyone who has average or slightly below average IQ are worthless sh*t as well. So it seems that the only way to win in society from his perspective is to be a Joe Rogan, a top notch high IQ masculine male badass who can get any girl he wants and easily get the respect of millions of men. But what seems wrong here is, we're not all Joe Rogan. Most people are far from it, and to no fault of their own. I've seen people who were not the top notch Rogan type win in society in their own way. They surround themselves with people like themselves and offer their talents to the world regardless of IQ or male badassness, or heteronormativeness, etc."

UggdgoHakWQiOngCoAEC,Rosemary Reyes,1503598433667,"Why mostly in men?
Because the logos you are looking for Dr. Peterson is that of the monogamous relationship and family.
Women are adopting a laissez faire attitude towards where their reproductive functions are directed and then applying an opposite standard to the partners that they choose for stability.
This is why cuck is such an insult now, because the new traditionalists have finally found the achilles heel of modern liberal culture: it's biologically and culturally unsustainable due to the extreme collapse of directed female efforts to secure the best man for all their needs, and has collapsed into a chaos where they are jumping between those who can fulfill a few of those needs, but not others.
Ultimately, this leads to a collapse in stability and order in relationships, and a shift away from those men that would ultimately die for those relationships.
The martyr is unnecessary, Jesus is unnecessary with this collapse.
The issue is, the females are taken advantage of by more horrible people as consequence of this, and there becomes a large population of men who feel that they haven't been given the chance to truly stand up and fight for this order.

This is who your audience is.

The women claim they don't need them, and flaunt their bodies and trample over the traditionalists.

The women are being mistreated as a result, becoming ever increasingly more dissatisfied, leading to more partner-jumping behavior with men who barely care enough to buy them coffee, much less protect them from anything they are worried about.

The men have had it.
They are willing to grab a rifle and die or be locked up for hate speech in order to have a passionate and comforting life and the women are ignoring them.
Mark my words, every decent person will be a radical very soon. Every horrible person will coalesce with the growing tide of urban anti-nationalist scum.
Civil war across the entire planet.
This cannot be stopped now."

Ugj-MIUCsKyrxngCoAEC,bucket foot5,1503598439200,"The individual is not salvation in the new testament, Jesus is the salvation in the new testament. The new testament is about the subordination of the individual to god. He is trying to manipulate the bible to be about individualism, he is imprinting his own life philosophy onto the bible. Which is what everyone else does, and as a result there are thousands of different denominations of Christianity that are contradictory. I can't understand how someone can read the bible and interpret the new testament as being about the individual is salvation. The only way to do it is to think that Jesus was a metaphor for the individual and that all of his followers in the latter books of the new testament were using Jesus as a metaphor as opposed to a real person. I think that is an incredibly naive interpretation of the book.

Jesus accepted his death voluntarily but the difference between him and a normal person, is he did not have to. He was god, he did not have to sacrifice himself to himself. Accepting death when you do not have to die is the opposite of heroic, it is cowardly. To let someone die or yourself die when you have the power to stop it, is not heroic it is villainous."

I saw right through the bullshit and almost had to laugh to myself whenever I questioned a lecturer on the 'meaning' of a work (what forlorn hope that was) and all they could do was summon more bewildering prattle to cover up the fact they had just pulled 'ideas' right from the recesses of their own anus. It was interminably frustrating. Of course, I was made to feel stupid and inferior as a result. The word 'intellectual' has been undermined by this ideology and not since Hitchens have I felt as strong a level of respect and admiration for a public intellectual as I've come to embody for JBP.

Aside from that, we are only a little over 100 days into his Presidency and he has faced an unprecedented level of resistance from establishment politicians on both sides of the aisle and the mainstream media. Any of his promises not coming to fruition fully within such a short time span are not due to a lack of effort on his part.

Realities where they have purpose and meaning, things they can overcome, status to be earned and rewards to be reaped. It may seem trivial to people at this time, but as technology progresses, making these virtual worlds more  enticing and 'real', as well as destroying so many jobs with automation people will turn to these simulated realities to live out the archetypal stories we crave so much."

Marxism is not just the oppressed/ oppressor dynamic and advocating revolution towards a utopian vision. That was part of what Marx wrote and was definitely influencial, but his main body of work involved a solid critique of capitalism, which is why it's still relevant. So what people mean when they invoke ""Marxism"" can vary; I think thats worth pointing out."

Ugiur6vgPbrF-ngCoAEC,Jan Manuel Schlieper,1503598538142,"49:47 This! This is why this is often coming from women, blacks, minorities etc.,As they ave on average(!) less capacity to think as clearly as they. This also explains their marginalisation in a society that heavily builds on IQ (or it least it did in the past :/). Naturally they wish for a different society, as this one is not for them, and I think they should have it! Im all for voluntary segregation along all kinds of different lines. Peaceful de-imperialisation. The groups mentioned  ""suffer"" form higher emotional pressure, clouding their thinking. Some even claim that jews, while being highly intelligent suffer from this too, as they have also very high amounts of emotional pressure. Of course this does not count for all, but an average it might make a difference. there is science to this, people ""back then"" knew it intuitively, and also you will probably agree that some people are just shorter tempered then others. The assumption that people are all the same in this regards maybe has lead to the decline of the west, thought this topic is very much suppressed by the groups that fall under this category. Classic members of these groups are: Women, Blacks, Jews. I just came to the conclusion that this is in part due to ""breeding"" patterns in these groups: Women are ""bread"" for beauty, (and youthful impulsiveness is indeed kind of beautiful _ ), and blacks probably have been bread for agressiveness, you can see that in todays gang culture. Of course all of this is not clear cut, and you can find great exceptions of these tendencies, still, I think the right is on to something. If you take into account ""race/ethnicity"", ""gender"" things suddenly fall into place!"

UghEahzOg6Nh5HgCoAEC,StudioStar,1503598545501,"It´s so interesting to note that Jordan Peterson in essence is a post-modernist himself. He agrees with the fundamentals of what some post-modern philosophy is. Still he goes on to construct straw-men of the ""average post-modernists"" and then use those to emphasize points of disagreement, but it´s always done in a very myopic and dishonest way. He talks about the post-modern view of power-structures for instance, claiming it´s all they (who?) care about. I encourage anyone to read a bit of Foucault, with an open mind, before taking Petersons word for anything. Foucault himself said the dynamics of power where extremely intricate and constantly changing and therefore also said he never wanted to even attempt to construct some unifying theory. Doing so, he felt, would just be destructive for the future conversation on the topic. But I suspect most people listening to JRE are not too into philosophy."

In fact the whole thing is like a bourgeoisie cabal-no one gives a f*ck about the workers until they need them to do anything. I thought M. Derrida was a Dadaist at best and a fantasist at worst-he and his fellow travellers construct castles out of thin air and tell you they are real. Unfortunately, like Guinness, these ideas don't travel well-America has taken it far too seriously and we've ended up with this sh*t.  I come from a working class background which means you have to get with stuff-most of this crap happens when well off people spend too much time gazing at their belly button.

Poland lost 22,2% of it's population. For example during WWII USSR lost 11,6% , USA - 0,29%, France- 0,15%, UK-0,8%.
German Nazis as a part of their ideology of making ""living space"" for the ""supreme race"" and turning the ramians of the polish nation into slaves they've exterminated about 30% of polish elites   ( doctors, lawyers, scientists, teachers).It was called ""Intelligenzaktion"".

I'm a woman.  But I think I understand what he means that young men are not getting enough of what they need to hear about the truth of their struggles and responsibilities.  

In addition to the obvious richness of his intellect and ideas, I think what's special about Peterson is his willingness and capacity to expose his personal vulnerability.  Listening to him is listening to a whole person--a human being in the same struggle as the rest of us.  He's not hiding behind a facade of intellect or academic professionalism (though he has those, he doesn't use them to hide behind them).   Joe Rogan has this gift too.  

I think its a great thing that there are men like Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan who can model all that's good about being a man while seeming not to be ashamed to show that being vulnerable is part of it.  Uncertainty, struggle, fear, loss, emotional needs, all is part of being a whole person.  And embracing yourself as a man (if you're a man) is a good thing."

UgilBx_C2UH4j3gCoAEC,bob smith,1503598638938,"Peterson has a serious mental handicap imo that make him completely unable to step out of his mindset as a professor lecturing on his particular brand of psychology. He is mentally STUCK in that state, where he cannot simply respond to what was just asked of him, he has to respond to it like it was just prefaced with the words ""and in your interpretation of this through a lens of yungian archetypes what is your opinion on...""

But NO Jordan, you weren't just fucking asked that, you were asked a relatively straightforward simple question, and you fucking respond with a long diatribe that begins with 400 syllables before you even begin to come close to maybe kinda sorta addressing what you were asked about. it's mind boggling and I know I'm not the only one that sees this"
UgjcNyYTZ5CGUngCoAEC,Wade Gonzalez,1503598638944,"I really don’t think Jordan understands the position of the so-called “New Atheists”. Guys like Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens fought against belief in religious deities as concrete objective entities because that sort of belief causes - and has caused - a lot of harm. If everyone who claimed to be religious merely read their religious texts strictly as fables and metaphors to be learned from in an abstract sense like any other literature, this would be a much different world. Jordan, however, seems to be disregarding the fact that the majority of religious people believe literally in their deities, and the work of people like Harris and Hitch who’ve fought against that kind of belief and the damage it’s caused and will continue to cause.

I greatly admire Peterson but this seems like a blind-spot of his, and why his conversations with Sam Harris have been so fruitless."

....The critic wonders about the political reading of Star wars. ""An anti-Soviet film? Racist film? The heroes are white (pink) and blond, the black wicked. The least funny is that it does not belong to the author. George Lucas is not particularly racist, nor neo-Nazi, nor even McCarthist. It simply flatters the Western popular memory. ""

In the left-wing newspaper, three days later, Ignacio Ramonet returns to the film, which he sees, ""under his unctuous charms"", as the ""last gadget engaged in the film war by American cultural imperialism.""

The People's Daily (November 10), a French Maoist newspaper of the 1970s, sees an obvious reactionary background. ""Everything is there: religious preaching-preaching, obscurantism, fascist elitism, racism, Zionism, and so on. (...)

""Essentially they fucked with the wrong dude""-Joe Rogan on Jordan Peterson's battles with SJW extremists. 

""My sense is that if you want to change the world you start from yourself and work outward because you build your competence that way. It's like, I don't know how you can go out and protest the structure of the entire economic system if you can't keep your room organized.""
-Jordan Peterson 

""What would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew they should do, you know, because the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is an existential catastrophe and a tragedy, how much is our own corruption contributing to that. Thats a really worthwhile question. The things you leave undone, because you're angry, you're resentful, you're lazy, you have inertia. Well, you consult your conscience and it says well, you know, that place over there could use a little work. It's the same as working on yourself and so you clean that up because you can, and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better of because you've practiced a bit and so you're a little stronger and then something else manifests itself and says well maybe you could, like, take a crack at fixing me up too. So you decide to do that and then that gets a little bit more pristine... and it's humble because you're not exceeding your domain of competence. It's like, don't be fixing up the economy, eighteen year olds. You don't know anything about the economy. Its a massive, complex machine beyond anyone's understanding and you mess with it at your peril. So, can you even clean up your own room? No. Well, you should think about that. You should think about that. Because if you can't even clean up your own room, who the hell are you to give advise to the world.""
-Jordan Peterson 

""People can improve themselves, I think, to a degree that we don't understand. Because a human being, for better or worse, is something potential, as well as something actual, and that's really weird, that idea of potential because its not actually measurable or tangible... its something like the idea of spirit.""
-Jordan Peterson

UgjGWqUadrrn4XgCoAEC,Matthew Roxburgh,1503598680113,"I planned to watch maybe 40 minutes of this today, as I had other work to do. Foolish gambit expecting to not be completely drawn into a video like this for the full length. I laughed, smiled, and admittedly cried during parts of this. I really don't cry too often, but the amount of truths revealed in this podcast, which were made known in my own being (admittedly revealing the lies I tell myself) really hit me. Dr. Peterson is probably my favorite person today. He is man of wisdom, and men like that seem to be lacking today... or maybe that's just how I see it as I am just a person of modern times. Either way, that is the case in the university I attend. I had to pause this video many times just to digest the hard pills to swallow that Peterson served. I have been a fan of him for a few months now, but I come out of this podcast once again full of awe. 

Although I guess this technically counted as ""procrastination"" from my studies, I hope to continue on with this reinvigorated sense of motivation and inspiration I gained from these 3 hours and continue to chase heaven and run away from hell. Thank you Dr. Peterson."

Ugh0szx8Yq-NRHgCoAEC,Mshojat,1503598680160,"I agree with Peterson that requiring professors (or other staff in other occupations) to use any pronoun they want is not good.

However, unlike Peterson, I think that it's very reasonable to use some sort of neutral term, even if it's just for the purposes of describing a person of unknown sex (such as someone who posted a message online, or an anonymous author, or unknown criminal). Generally, even while it has a 2nd meaning, I think ""they"" is certainly reasonable and seems to be where people are heading with it.

I consider Peterson's argument against using the word ""they"" (and ""their) to be weak. As far as I've heard, its simply because it hasn't been used historically like that, nor is everyone currently doing it. I'd ask Peterson at what level of modern usage would it be required? As it stands, I'd say it's extremely prevalent in it's usage. It might not be ideal, but it works. English is full of words with double/triple/multi-meanings anyway, along with illogical spellings and all sorts of other nonsense, so why be stubborn about this one thing?

For reasons entirely separate than self-identifying ""non-binary"" people, I've always thought that having gendered articles —such as in latin-based languages like French and Spanish— has been silly, and that even gendered pronouns is unnecessary and inefficient. AT THE LEAST I think that neutral pronouns should exist (they don't really quite exist in English), as well as neutral articles (they do exist in English).

It just makes total sense. Why should articles and pronouns refer to a person's sex? especially when objects (in the case of articles for other languages) don't even have actual sex. I'm no feminist, but we're all still _human_, so the pronoun should just represent that word —""the human"", then have another pronoun for other living things like ""the animal"", then another pronoun for non-living things. Gender is rarely ever relevant, and when it is, it can easily be mentioned then with the addition of another word (female/male, man, boy, lady, etc.)

I would say it would be reasonable for a professor to be forced to chose between he/she/they, and as long as it was under reasonable circumstances where a person might not look entirely like their biological gender (the reason I'd say this is important, is to prevent people from exploiting it in an insincere manner just to mess with the professor in a disrespectful way, such that many different people would have different preferred pronouns, and he'd have significant difficulty remembering them all)"

Before wow, f. ex. in Everquest it was Jejeje, that played a similar role.

Maybe they chose kek, because of Starcraft being immensely popular in Korea, and the kekeke was as close to the korean word for lol you could get when using hangul(?) the western letters in the game. Im not really sure, except Im certain that is the connection to Kek.  That would date kek to the early 2000's iirc. - probably predating alot of the kekistan'ers tbh."

UgiBakb5R2VVvXgCoAEC,Alex,1503598706913,"Let's get our myths straight: -

In World of Warcraft (the MMORPG), there are two warring factions, the Horde and the Alliance. The players from either faction can't communicate with each other by language, because the game ""translates"" their text to a sort of random ""gibberish"" (from the perspective of the other faction's player). But when a Horde player says ""lol"" in the presence of an Alliance player, the latter always sees ""kek"" (I think it was ""ogo"" the other way around).

Some more meme magic - the Horde are (originally) the orcs, trolls, tauren, and undead. The Alliance are the humans, dwarves, gnomes, and night elves. It wouldn't be too far of a stretch to look at these two factions as ""chaos"" and ""order"", respectively (this is parallel from Warhammer-lore).

My people are being red-lined, profiled, humiliated, and murdered by police, under serviced in medical care, denigrated and misrepresented in media, exploited abroad for their mineral rich lands, and I SHOULD CLEAN MY ROOM?  What is the stupidity?  This is the most condescending garbage dump of advice I ever heard in my life! MLK was effective, he must have had a clean room!  

Let me get this right,  there is nothing wrong with a man who undergoes and operation to become a woman but THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT CLEAN HIS ROOM IS THE PROBLEM?  A hypocrite is more mentally stable than a person who thinks he is something he is clearly not.  At least a hypocrite knows he is not what he says he is but acts otherwise.  Transgenderism is mentally illness.   This is not even a bad thing.  How can association dissociative identity be an illness and Transgenderism not be? HOW? This clean your room nonsense is seriously demented thinking!  I have a funny hunch that if a person was against post modernism and SJW he would be able to tolerate a messy room.  This is landfill thinking. 

People get to hung up on the word God?  Okay let me play your game Rogan.  Weed is a schedule one drug, people get to hung up on that designation schedule one.  YOU CARE ABOUT WEED SO YOU CARE ABOUT THAT DESIGNATION.  I CARE ABOUT GOD SO I CAN ABOUT THAT MEANING!  

Peterson is an atheist and that is fine.  I have no problem with that.  I subscribe to many atheist channels.  I just hate it when he tries to make Christianity some psychological expression of ancient social angst all the while saying his is Christian.  If Sam Harris explains Christianity in psychological terms that is fine because he admits his belief system as atheism so he is just explaining a thing in HIS way.   That is like me saying I am a jujitsu player and it is about being on top.   That's it.  The name name of the game is be on top, because if you get top position you win.

That's a reasonable use of 'independence' and is a much less strong claim.

Men need men to show them how to be men and women need women to show them how to be women, otherwise you have a bunch of people just trying to figure it out, which can work, but it is much easier to have someone show you how to grow as a person.  As for men, there is a deficit of positive male role models, this is why Joe Rogan is so popular, and I guarantee that the majority of people watching here are men looking for that person to teach them how to be a better man.  Think of all of the different walks of life here in the U.S., if you live here that is.  You could be a poor kid in the ghetto whose mom is raising him by herself, or you could be a middle class or upper class kid for that matter whose dad is too preoccupied with work to give his son the time and attention he needs to develop into a man, or your parents could be divorced and you could've been raised by a single mother.  In other words, most men don't have a strong male role model in their life to show them how to be a man.  Combine this with our cultures assault on masculinity and you get the millenial man."

UgiUAmlqkarwnHgCoAEC,Keanu X,1503598746744,Peterson is in such a good mood in this video XD yay
UgheNcrgtPU67ngCoAEC,Leopard-King,1503598746757,"Let me lay down my obvious agreements.  No one should be forced to call anyone by any name or designation by punishment of law.  Dialogue is always good.  Civility is to be expected of a noble people under normal circumstances. Intellectual freedom is the foundation of a thriving liberal society. 

Okay here is my objection.  Peterson suffers from the same thing his opposition suffers from, it is an all or nothing perspective. Everything is a zero sum game.  The SJW crowd sees EVERYTHING as a power struggle between classes of oppressor and oppressed.  They will disabuse you of any notion of inner turmoil playing itself out in one's life with countless anecdotes of oppressive systems that devise traps for the oppressed.  Peterson goes the other way.  Everything is just a manifestation of inner turmoil.  Any acknowledgement of oppression means you are bitter.  Just to recognize it is indicative of some maladaptive social skill.  THERE ARE OPPRESSED PEOPLES!  You can't wish them away, nor the systems you suffer under,  nor dismiss them by using absurd examples that parade as case studies of oppression when they are clearly deeply personal disturbances that corrupt relationships and create toxic situations.   If you should not ""play the victim""  then should the African slaves have been more contemplative chained naked to the bottom of a slave ship?  Should the Jews have chanted some empowering self-help mantra in the gas chambers?  Should the Russians that starved to death in gulags engaged in behavior therapy?  Should the North Koreans in labor camps presently think positive?  At what point can you call oppression oppression?  At what point CAN you get bitter at it?  Ever?  I find it a curious thing that when white conservatives speak about the oppression their people contribute to, it is a matter of not being a victim, but a North Korean in a labor camp is for sure a victim. Why?  GUILT FREE RIGHTEOUSNESS! 

Oppression is not just about poverty.  Plenty of middle class to rich peoples can be oppressed.  Oppression is restriction of liberty NOT BANK ACCOUNT SIZE!  Was the famed American boxing heavy weight Jack Johnson oppressed?  Of course he was oppressed!  He was very rich in his day, but could not be served in a restaurant of his choosing.  This is why people laugh at Kanye West when he complains about not getting the proper funding, freedom, and promotion for his clothing and shoe line.   It is not about being poor versus being rich, it is about restriction of liberty and not being afforded the proper respect to you because of immutable identity. 


Peterson moans about the other then speaks about the Post Modernists as THE OTHER.  Then a huge discussion about evolution ensues.  Oh boy, whatever happened to clear intelligence.  What is the obvious answer,  THE OTHER IS A REAL THING!  This idea of the other is REAL!  That is why Peterson goes at the Post Modernists as long and hard as he does,  THEY ARE OTHER!  I am not even saying that is good or bad, but this idea that deep down we are all the same is not always true.  We have similarities and the capacity to change, however when someone is in an enemy group TREAT THEM THAT WAY!  Should we bleed our hearts out for serial killers?  How about  UNREPENTED child molesters that think they did nothing wrong?  How a Neo-Nazis?  I believe in redemption but NOT ON THE BATTLE FIELD!  That is like a soldier refusing to shoot at an enemy combatant because, ""hey man, he eats lunch and goes to the bathroom just like me!""  Yeah and he wants to take your country and rule over you!  No one has to be locked in an enemy category, but that has NOTHING to do with evolution and snakes.  That is such a silly idea.  Are you acting out your ancient fear of predators when you oppose Post Modernists, or do you just think they will ruin society and ring in tyranny?  Snakes, come on man.  You go from mountain top to valley."

That being said, I feel I should make a counter argument for communism from what is being said here for the sake that we all may develop our arguments for or against communism more fully. Marx explicitly states the development to communism in the following stages. We take society from agrarian to capitalist to advanced capitalist to communist. When people argue that we cannot judge communism based off of what historical examples give us, they are actually correct in doing so, since these historical examples are based off agrarian societies trying to jump straight into communism (Take for example Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward).

Then again just because some people are born with a mutation that ends up with them to having 6 fingers on each hand does not mean that Regressives marxists can claim that humans have a variation of digits on their hands by default or that we can grow fucking flippers instead of arms on a whim.

I.e. the human species is not defined by a categorical fractional minority of people but of a much, much larger majority of whom determine how science and scientists can go about describing and defining our species. In fact there has been NO real peer-reviewed scientific study whatsoever that has  overturned the very real scientific biological fundamental fact that human beings are a dimorphic species, i.e a species DEFINED BY TWO SPECIFIC GENDERS.

Lastly, teaching the cultural marxist manufactured gender-bender ""I identify as a attack helicopter"" bullish to young kids is no different then teaching that the earth is flat earth in schools in order to indoctrinate them indirectly into the cult of marxism. It fucking child abuse/ideological political child molestation of the highest order by the left and the far-left cultural marxists who embrace and push this bullshit."

The thing I don't understand is Joe seems to understand Jordan and the whole cultural Marxism experience but still indulges and agree's with some of his guests in the tropes of everyone being racist, sexist and bigoted being the answer to every question.

I burst out laughing. Now that's funny!

On a more serious note: The notion of phallogocentrism is that everything in the world revolves around masculine thoughts, processes, ideas, that masculine attributes are that which form the world, our societies, etc.

Of course, males have no virtues and only vices, based on the premise that a) men are in absolute and total control of anything important in the world, and that the world is imperfect. Therefore, the opposite, the feminine is weak, virtuous, innocent and pure. That which is male corrupts and must be taken down to make way for its Manichean counterpart.

That's the notion, anyway."

He doesn't address many legitimate criticisms of religions, or the systems of control and the irrationality they breed, but he sure does alter my perceptions on the topic. Which is a good thing.

I have also sat here awestruck at this man's intellect. How Jamie could possibly surf Twitter while this man lays outs such wisdom is beyond me.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen copies of the Gulag Archipelago towering over his head without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the books and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent the bloody post-modernists from starving 6 million Ukrainians to death,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that makes any sense. After she scanned each book and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by raving on about how he's ""the Jungian archetypal prophet, roughly speaking"" and how she ""needs to do the damn reading and sort herself out"""

UghX8yA8CRYmX3gCoAEC,MonkEsquire,1503598866408,"Touching on something that was discussed here about how men are desperate for responsibility in life while at the same time under incredible pressure to climb the dominance hierarchy. When they talk about the hierarchy they always talk about the people on top (the winners)  but almost never talk about everyone else underneath them (the losers) and what that means today. 

Men in todays society are in a total state of chaos. Men don't know how to live in this world where being a man is something to be ashamed of. Men are being pushed out of the workplace by women, automation and globalisation at an alarming pace and its devastating to mens confidence.

A mans worth in society is defined by his ability to provide and contribute. If you can't do that or if you fail in the social competition then you're labelled a LOSER and there's almost no bigger shame for a man than to be labelled a loser.  So we look at the world, we look at how we have no meaning or goal and wonder ""why the hell am I trying to play this game of life when I already know the outcome?""

This is why I think video games are so popular among men, especially low status men.

When men see the dominance hierarchy of our society, and see their place in it and see that there's no way UP it then they become incredibly disenfranchised and resentful of it.

Then video games come along and they act as a replacement hierarchy that they can WIN. Video games present a clear goal and a clear challenge to overcome that you interact with via the mechanisms of the video game. They can save the princess, they can increase their power, wealth & status. They can BECOME THE HERO. That's something that they see themselves never achieving in the real world and that's incredibly attractive & addictive to young men who feel like they have no place in the world."

UgijcfztrRueLHgCoAEC,i7fan,1503598866444,"This was an incredible EP. Thanks Jordan & Joe! 

I have to say that i am in more understanding of the psychology/meaning of Christianity now thanks to Jordan, and i understand how important it is for our society. Thats coming from an atheist btw. But the core of it that we should work hard, defend freedom, create a family to further the human race and act as good as we can is very important for a western society. It took thousands of years to get to where we are today with our free society where everyone can carve out a life for themselves and find their happiness. Thats worth protecting if anything! Jordan is the only person who speaks about religion that i respect because he explains it from an intelligent point of view without the superstitious elements. 
I find it very interesting with the notion of hell when you die because its a way to light a fire under each and everyone's ass to do the right thing. To have a family to further the human race, to work hard and make sure society stays on point, and to defend it. By saying that you will go to hell individually means everyone (or hopefully many) works hard because they dont want to go there, but the reality of what that means and how it was meant by the thinkers/writers is that if we dont ALL chip in then the SOCIETY goes to hell. So by lighting a fire under each man's (hu-man, for all you feminists) ass by telling them they will go to hell they hoped that would make everyone chip in so that society wont fall into a mess (hell). That is something I as an atheist can appreciate because its not only genius but necessary. Jordan needs to keep speaking about all this in the terms he did in the video because it unites us all, religious or not (and we need that these days). Just like people from right to left come together against SJW because it will bring ""hell"" if we let it grow. Wait a minute... Is Jordan our modern messiah, our prophet?! Might be! :D

Anyway, all I know is that your wise words are needed, Jordan, and from now on all of us who try our best to be logical, rational and speak the truth will call ourselves ""TW's"" - Truth Warriors! (Thanks Joe!). :)"
