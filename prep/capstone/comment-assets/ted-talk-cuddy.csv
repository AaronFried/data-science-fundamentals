What I have experienced has been profound. After monitoring my body language and assuming more expansive body postures throughout my day I have been able to deal with conflict and participate more in college. I even managed to conquer my fear of small talk, which quickly brought me to bagging a job from someone I originally felt intimidated by. The best part is I got the offer without doing an interview, without searching for the job, and it pays better than any job I've had before. Also, I didn't realize before just how much my sitting slumped in a chair, touching my neck was negatively impacting my mindset and my emotional state. I really believe there is something valuable to this research. Don't knock it 'til you try it."

UgxBVaoKcAe3OWTnWud4AaABAg,Dener Pardo,1532787858422,"Three conclusions:
1. If in the experiment risk tolerance varies on average of 22.5% for high power people and 12.5% ​​for low power people, it is clear that high power people tend to be more unstable.
2. 86% bluff for high power people indicate that they are also more dishonest. This may explain the corruption bias in politics (more power, more dishonesty).
3. The negative bias for high power people is higher than for low power people. So, possibly high power people are most affected by failure."

I find your hair hanging over your left eye as well as your outfit a wonderful example of negating that male dominance you speak of by selecting dark stockings, dark suit, loose fitting jacket tied by loose fitting belt. You mention MBA students - your outfit and hairdo would be 'out of place' in the boardroom. Of course everything is open to one's own interpretation - again like your somewhat 'hybrid' outfit, part  part business (covered your legs yet didn't opt for pants nor biz suit - do not want to attract TOO MUCH of the wrong attention, show legs just camo them just a wee bit!) part pretty blonde with the frilly hairdo - that'll hold the guys attention and make the girls take notes. By the way as a psychologist what do you consider to be the reason your audience found your chosen example of the police officer's hand not being shook so amusing? Perhaps they too feel 'less than' and really enjoy seeing someone 'less than' them? Your next TED talk perhaps."

UgxHB2EK9SmsLqFpRKV4AaABAg,Amina088,1527517468717,"Today I come back to this talk after so many years. Surprisingly, I still tear up when she share her personal story at the end, exactly just like what I did when I first heard it long back. I think that this is the power of vulnerability. People appreciate knowledge and insight. Anyone does. However, it's only when we feel connected to the speaker that we can truly appreciate and make use of what we listen to. Yesterday I met a guy who rejected me last year and was shocked by how hurt I felt. I thought I've moved on. I thought that I have become ""strong enough"" to forget the pain caused by him. Yet, I wasn't. At least, not yet. And so I somehow recall back about this talk. 'I remember that it was really good. Hmmmm What did she say again?' 

Now that I'm back here, I realized that yesterday my pose was the low-power pose all the time. I kept touching my chin, protecting my fear, without realizing how small I was making myself feel. On one hand, I kinda regret how I didn't come back to this talk earlier and how I didn't make a full use of this talk since my first time hearing it. But--- on the other hand, I think this is not too late. Being 21, I shouldn't be scared of feeling hopeless. Yes, there will inevitably be days I face such awkward and challenging moments again. But I can do better every time I go through it. Just like Amy and many successful people in this world, I'm gonna fake it till I truly become that emotionally strong lady I deserve to be. :') THANK YOU AMY, her sweet professor, and anyone who help her to become who she is, as well as TED TALKS for sharing such meaningful messages. // With loves & respect from Bangkok, Thailand!"

Fisiologicamente também ha diferença, em dois hormônios chave: testosterona, que é o hormônio da dominância, e cortisol, que é o hormônio do estresse.Tendo testosterona alto, e cortisol baixo. - Amy Cuddy

They were paid for their positive result only and they knew the hypothesis and so did the researchers. These facts violate basic scientific principles and acceptable research practices. One of the original researchers of this study, Dana Carney, no longer believes the effects of power poses are real, based on recent evidence. Power poses don't change brain chemistry. Considering dopamine is the neurotransmitter responsible for confidence AND the placebo effect, it's easy to see why people think power poses increase confidence. That doesn't mean quit doing what's working, if it's working, then keep doing it. I'm just clarifying that power poses don't cause any real change.Edit: I really wish someone would've provided water for Amy, with headphones on, her cotton-mouth is almost deafening."

Faking only temporarily got things done for me, but it also caused me to delay addressing the true mental health issues that were working against me in the first place. For me, being as honest as possible with myself about my true feelings and intentions is what has made me more confident because I finally understood myself and that understanding made me feel loved. The ""fake it till you make it"" advice is like telling an anorexic person to just fake that they don't have an eating disorder and to eat a healthy diet with enough calories. While following that advice might help them by giving them good nutrition, it doesn't directly address the mental health issues that contributed to that eating disorder and might even hurt them because faking may cause their mind to reject the truth. I'm not here to hate on those for whom Amy Cudy's advice worked, but I also want people to know that it is not the only truth that exists."

Usually I don't like them, they are our competition but in a corporate environment we're forced to behave nice. 
So since I force my verbal communication to be nice, my non-verbal or body language starts to compensate, my behavioral aura becomes much more dominant and probably a bit high strung. I noticed when I'm exchanging pleasantries with these people, I'm standing straight, shoulders back, jaws tightened even my lats muscles are spread out and my stomach muscles tensed. It's like I'm ready to go to war.
Behaviour is an extremely interesting subject and I feel it's very primal, physical, instinctive and based on survival. It's very handy if you learn to control it."

Then, she talks about an experiment in which job candidates struck either high power or lower poses, and were then evaluated by coders.  The coders selected the ""high power pose"" candidates as the best.  Unless I'm missing something, these two statements seem to be in direct contradiction.  Is she instructing us to strike high power poses in interviews or not?"

You have to try this;  the power will blow you away and no one will know why. 

Walk towards your boss, a banker, a friend, a neighbor, the produce guy in the grocery store...walk right foot right arm, left foot left arm.  Right right left left. Practice making it look normal.  Smile.  Look directly into the eyes and smile with your lips.  Only takes 1 or 2 steps and your boss or produce guy will BACK UP a few steps or at least lean backwards.

UgzmeetFXde27vOqC0Z4AaABAg,Chawat Marathi,1517149494573,"In 2014, Eva Ranehill and other researchers tried to replicate this experiment with a larger group of participants and a double-blind setup. Ranehill et al. found that power posing increased subjective feelings of power, but did not affect hormones or actual risk tolerance. 
Two researchers at the Wharton School, Simmons & Simonsohn, later shared a meta-analysis of the same 33 studies on their statistics blog.Based on the distribution of p-values reported across the studies (the 'p-curve'), they concluded that studies so far have demonstrated little to no average effect of power posing. Their analyses will appear in Psychological Science.

In a pre-registered direct replication, found that expansive (vs. contractive) body postures had either no effect or actually reduced psychological states associated with power. The fact the study was pre-registered, had a large n (over 300), used multiple measures of power (an ultimatum game, a gamble, and feelings of being powerful and in charge), and tested not only posing but adopting a direct eye gaze increases confidence that expansive poses have no or in fact negative effects on feelings of power.

Another critique of the findings and methodology appeared in a January 2016 article published in Slate magazine by two professors at Columbia University.

In response to the results of these replication studies and meta-analysis, Carney repudiated the effect in an open letter dated September 2016, stating ""The evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable"", and discouraging others from studying power poses.

Since the release of Carney's statement a special issue of Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology has been published on the topic of power posing. A summary paper co-authored by Carney entitled ""CRSP special issue on power poses: what was the point and what did we learn?"", states that a meta-analysis of the preregistered studies included in the issue, ""showed a reliable non-zero effect on felt power"".] In fact, according to Gronau et al, who conducted this meta-analysis, it ""yields very strong evidence for an effect of power posing on felt power"".

The ""power posing"" theory has been described as an example of the so-called replication crisis in psychology, in which initially seductive theories could not be replicated in follow-up experiments."

In here own retraction statement from 2015:

Where do I [Amy Cuddy] Stand on the Existence of “Power Poses”
1.  I do not have any faith in the embodied effects of “power poses.”
 I do not think the effect is real.
2.  I do not study the embodied effects of power poses.
3. I discourage others from studying power poses.
4.  I do not teach power poses in my classes anymore.
5.  I do not talk about power poses in the media and haven’t for over 5 years (well before skepticism set in)
6.  I have on my website and my downloadable CV my skepticism about the effect and links to both the failed 
replication by Ranehill et al.

The amount of each in the body varies based on how we stand and present ourselves and also how we react to a certain situation. One thing I found that I can apply to my life is the ""fake it till you make it"" and the idea of power posing. Personally I have always struggled when communicating with people  I do not know that well as well as presenting in front of a large group of people. Power posing can help me with presenting because it can make me appear confident to the audience I am presenting to and if they begin to perceive me as confident, I may begin to believe that I am. The idea of fake it till you make it can help me hold conversations with people I might not know by allowing me to act interested; therefore, making conversation and responses easier."

And of course, create lifelong friendships."
UgztzzEP2rbY0n6eN814AaABAg,thedoctor7000,1506608728553,"This is a good talk, but I don't think the job interview example is true all the time.  In technical fields (engineering, industrial design, scientific research, manufacturing) experience and technical skills trump personality.  We recently interviewed two candidates at my company.  One was confident, sat up straight, looked us in the eye, had a good handshake.  The other was hunched over, nervous, a little manic and awkward, and looked away when talking to someone.  Guess who got the job?  The awkward person because they could answer more technical questions, had more design experience, and their past projects were much more impressive.  So maybe if two people had identical resumes but had different mannerisms, then your body language may make a difference.  Just an opinion, I'm no expert.  But I think just being good at your job and continuing to learn and grow in your field is your best path.  But the presenter is correct, good body language doesn't hurt your chances."

UgxosinO5wA5YDKBpOp4AaABAg,Suko Pyramid,1503930328623,"I don't like this practical biological approach to psychology, it only serves the propuse of backing fantasies with scientific facts. The fantasy that one has full power over their feelings. And that you can play with your mind like a toy to get any outcome you want. But the bigger problem is that even if you could control yourself like a puppet this wouldn't make your goals more healthy or fruitful. I think the idea behind this TED talk is that power brings happiness when that's not necessarily true and the situations or remorse that can make you unhappy won't go away with power or with high self-esteem. Also there's this ideal of feeling commanding and in control of everything that can be really stressful to pull off all the time. Not listening to ones doubts can ultimately make you lose sense of reality and be damaging for your social relationships because this ideology doesn't accept that randomness and the world around us takes part in how we live unfortunately. Her story just shows how ideals can be unhealthy, is understandable and I emphasize with her. Faking it can make it but cannot become it because being successful is not part of ones personality."

Ugg2D0UzEgqhrXgCoAEC,keshav kumar,1503930337227,"I am sorry to say this,but make it till you fake it works only for moments. I would take you as example. you started with high power, you not only used non verbals but also verbals. But still, while moving towards the end of talk, your power drive is diluted. it's been sucked out of your body(when you got personal especially, a powerful simply does not get personal at work). And that thing is not what happens with powerful. they breath in it. 


to become powerful, you need to understand your present status and where you want to be. calculate the distance and check points. as you will achieve those check points, people will tell you that you have changed, you are more assertive, demanding and precise, which they call power(like the science, which if not understood is considered a miracle), but you know that these are requirements to get this work done and at what pitch you should deal others to get the work done."
Ugi8GVonEbrw0HgCoAEC,m marco,1503930337247,"I guess no one is going to point out that Amy has terrible posture.  Oh, we're just going to let that go.

UgiurwPabFN2jHgCoAEC,谢昊天,1503930346791,"It is indeed a very inspirational speech. Nonetheless the effect of embodied power poses are shown to be false by many other experiments. Even one of the scholar Amy collaborated with on her experiment presented during the speech sent out an open letter stating a change of mind and discouraging others of further studying; inasmuch as the effect is likely non-existing. 

Reference: Ranehill, E. 2014; Simmons, J.  & Simonsohn, U. 2015; Garrison, Katie E. 2016; Carney, Dana 2016.

So for those who felt more powerful after power posing is likely just a placebo effect. I however do agree with her point on fake it until you become it. Always be self-encouraged to act is nice way to succeed.

Overall, it is good enough as a motivational speech; science wise, probably not. Ironic considering for one giving it being a scientist (social psychologist) /professor (assistant)."

The way Ms. Cuddy gets carried away when talking about her personal tragedy and the meeting with that girl, gave me the impression that she really wants to believe her study is true. It didn't fit a professional researcher, at least that's how I felt about that. It's so damn easy to get biased. And I agree with people pointing out her quite submissive posture. It didn't seem like she actually got more confident. Probably practice and routine plays a bigger part in that, idk /shrug"

I've been a very shy person. And I do notice that most of the time I sit with my hand on my neck and bent my shoulders and you know,  just feel like I don't belong here. But I'm a dancer and I think it's kind of a 'must' in the dance world to be open and socially interactive and more confident and powerfull. Because as a dancer, when you perform, people are going to scrutinize your body and your movement and and your facial expressions. I love dancing, and I told myself that I have to change and not underestimate myself so much. So I did. And I did this even before I watched this video. I'm still on my way there, but it's working. When I feel like I can't nail a coreography, I just move in and do it. I can already see a lot of changes in myself : I can memorize coreographies faster, I can move with more fluency, I'm not afraid to do improvs. And tons of other things. 

So, maybe instead of saying that this thing didn't work, you should just try it. Because who knows right?"

Ughnb8u5Gm4qX3gCoAEC,WalkinLA,1503930371077,"Objectivity is required here...  This presentation is one of the most viewed Ted Talks despite Amy saying virtually nothing useful or meaningful sorry to say until the very end when she said 'Little Tweaks' create great results.  Congratulations to her for overcoming a very difficult personal challenge truly, but did you hear her say that her identity was lost when the car wreck occurred?  Her identity is her intellect?  Perhaps that's the real issue here Amy?

What I detect is a sort of mania and not simply due to the speed of her thinking and yapping.  I sense deeply that she's trying to run away from herself while at once trying to find herself and that the intellectualization is actually a mask for unaddressed and undiscoverable emotions.  

This entire presentation is a psychological biography with very little to do with social science.  The 'science' of body language is understood by most intuitively, by animals innately which in my opinion points directly to her problem.  She's turned off her emotions and intuition in favor of formal intellect and is trying to find her way back to her feelings again.  She's a robot, and the tears, right on cue!  They're fake... 

Fake it until you make it?  Please!  Fake it to be honest with yourself!  Her brain knows something is wrong so it speeds up as an expression of the desperate quest.  It's sad and ridiculous.  Come out of your head Amy and quietly sit in what you THINK ails you.  You are on a one way track to some sort of schizophrenia if you don't.  

Why schizo?  Because they too divide their personalties to cope and eventually create a 'fake' one that seems manageable.  Perhaps you've already done this and are a high functioning schizo?   I mean no harm with these words.  I am though holding up a mirror that might be useful for you, and perhaps painful to hear, to look deeply into.

Lastly, why are you looking outside of yourself for answers?  Your understanding of behavior seems to be limited to EX-pressions only.  This means perceived, external, linear, scientific, symptomatic, 'neck-up' none of which include feelings or that which will provide what you are looking for which is apparently how you feel about yourself.  I speculate that there is an unknown trauma that is being avoided!  

You mention nothing about source causes, or the basis for gender distinction or most importantly the Human Chakras which is the foundation for confidence when in balance.  Have you ever heard the term 'Yellow Belly' referring to fear?  That refers specifically to the yellow chakra located just below the heart.  

Dr. Bruyere described the USA as a 'Yellow Culture'.  Perhaps that's why this presentation is so curiously popular?   Rather than looking outside of yourself and teaching and talking to large crowds, sit with yourself, or sit with one other honest person, who will help you to look inside and find your heart again.  I recommend that you work with a Reiki practitioner who will help you to find the location IN YOUR BODY where the trauma is energetically stored.  It's there, I'm certain of this.  :)  Be well."

Your persona, the facade you present to other people, your initial inclination to fabricate behavior
It isn't derived from a place of wanting to trick people
Rather it comes from a place of aspirations, it's because we're all very aware of our inadequacies that we all aspire to be better
And I think that's quite noble to want spare people from your own inadequacies, that you always work to better yourself.
You're not an impostor. I learnt that from school of life and brainpickings."

UgjXEYafvFNuAHgCoAEC,freedomforall,1503930421974,"I've been watching this and even though I find it interesting, I think psychologists have been gainning far too much power and credibility to decide peoples personal and specially professional lives, when none of that is science or scientifically proven, and these types of behavioural jumping conclusions based on a gesture or pose etc is a very dangerous thing in our modern society and is gaining more power than should, ignorance and subjectivity is gaining power, it worries me the way society is evolving in that matter.
The focus should be on the professional capability, not in being judged by irrelevant things, for example on a job interview, when the interviewer doesn't have the professional knowledge to evaluate anyone and the focus is on that,  when that's being done by a consulting agency that doesn't even have the legitimacy to rob you from your salary and labor rights, according to my evaluation."

UgiNfy3AHMvbRXgCoAEC,IdentifiablePerson,1503930422047,"[12:31] Nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves, [12:41] our bodies change our minds. - The above two statements and many other similar statements have the cause and effect problems, that is, which one is cause and which one is effect. It is natural because our society (based on capitalism) ignores the concepts behind the soul theory. The question is then what truth is?

The laws of nature are the only truth. These laws include: soul theory, yoga, yogic meditation, yogic power, reincarnation, destiny, memory in the universe, etc. Millions of people, all over the world, and for millions of years have experienced and observed them. For some examples take a look at https://theoryofsouls.wordpress.com/ You will find them on the internet also.

It is very easy to understand that we do not have freewill. We do not do anything without any reasons. Since our reasons come before we act, that means, our present action is controlled by our past reasons. Thus we are completely guided by our destiny. The destiny has two parts – global and individual. Our individual destiny is derived from the global destiny. Global destiny is created by the simultaneous interactions of all objects, living and nonliving, of the entire universe.

Thus the truth is – our life is completely predefined, before even we are born. And our destiny is already written in the memory of the universe. Any high level yogi will be able to read it and tell you exactly in all details. You can also acquire this divine vision by using yogic meditation. So, you cannot change anything in your life, not even god can do that. Destiny and God are contradictory concepts. Thus there is no God in any religion, because all religions have destiny."

Simply but true! Italian version: Aaaaaaah, adesso capisco perché in giro c'è pieno di villanzoni, specialmente tra i colorati: credono di esprimere una forte personalità seguendo codesti consigli.

That sort of thing has happened to me a lot when I'm under pressure. You think of what you should have done later on, when you're calm and can think straight.

UgiQG8HzuqChVngCoAEC,Rosemary Krider Schmid,1472394467577,"The comments about distractions during Amy Cuddy's TED Talk are easily circumvented by not watching the video! Instead, if you think there is value in her message, focus on that. The article that is cited showing not relationship cannot be accessed very easily. And, I didn't proceed long enough to find out if it is free or not.
If you look at the childhood pictures of many famous people you know of, you can often see that the once-retiring child is not that way at all as an adult. That's anecdotal, of course. People whose entire cultural background requires a submissive public (and usually private) behavior are at a disadvantage. Peaceful people can be and are powerful. Look at their body language!"

But with the advent of growing technologies, people become ever more introverted, thus leading to insecurities and reservations of self; hindering growth and progress. Sure, everyone goes through his/her own share of challenges; some more traumatising than others.

Intelligence isn't that crystallized, plus judgmenent is also important...She talks about a person's attitude but she doesn't mention differentiations in personality and emotions...like everything's coming from an outside authority and all that a person can do is conform to that. Of course non verbal elements are valuable and a person can adopt his/her physicality to match certain standards but thing is, most importantly, that a person has to decide with his/her free will how to proceed. If a posture is considered empowering that doesn't mean it fits all circumstances, in the end of the day more appealing than anything is a personal contribution. Enough with this systemic bullshit, individuation is the key, enough with cloning people's potential, mimicking will never lead anyone that far, it's sad to see adult people not recognizing their wounds, not working with them, just pretending superiority to influence their hormonal levels.

UgjQRb70QCIxKXgCoAEC,Neo,1472394509770,"Let me shed some reality on those who are always looking for ""science"". Maybe standing in a power pose for two minutes won't help many people. Especially if those people were quite a negative cynical type person to begin with.

Maybe the same could be said for someone holding a pen in their teeth. That it would't force them to smile while doing it and would not result in any positive feelings.

Think of our world. Our world where people look to the NEWS to get their information. They shop in the 80% of food-like part of the grocery store instead of the part that contains actual food.

The majority of these people, this simple ""power posing"" will not work. In fact, many things probably won't work. Not until they decide to come at something with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Until then, nothing will work.

Amy Cuddy's research is simply this. (and feel free to try this at home)

if you stay at home, eating nothing but junk food and drinking sodas, laying on the couch with CNN NEWS channel streaming 24/7....... I bet if you did this for a week straight, you'd feel pretty depressed.You'd feel pretty damn low.

On your next week, you'll get up off the couch. You'll put on your running shoes and head out on the streets. You'll smile to everyone you pass. you'll say hello to new people while you're out. You'll stop and take note of the beautiful scenery on this thing we call earth. You'll laugh with colleagues, you'll hug old friends, and you may even kiss a special someone......

Anyone want to take a guess as to how you might feel after experiencing that for an entire week?

Now before you bimbo's scream for ""SCIENCE!!!"", I'll say this: Try it for yourself. 

There's your so-called ""science"". Preferably I call it common-sense."

Words we say to ourselves are very powerful and have a huge impact on who we are. So telling yourself that you're going to ""Fake it"", is straight up telling yourself that you are nothing but a fraud in the situation. This underlying unconscious belief will be detrimental to your growth.

What you want to do is think of it like starting to walk for the very first time. Or shooting a basketball into the hoop. You learned it by a book, or a video and now you're out taking that knowledge and going to PRACTICE it.

You PRACTICE it every day. You make time for it. After every practice, you learn something new. You watch others and how they do it, you pick up tips from them, until you've mastered the skill so it becomes so natural.

Don't be a fraud. Be a student."

UgjWFt_qvE3DyXgCoAEC,Goran Vlacic,1472394516263,"So question on the study. Did the stress and power people go into a room together. Because if so I can think of an easy way to increase testosterone and decrease the cortisol of the non-power posers ... get rid of the power posers. Likewise, for the power posers, get rid of those that are left subjected to them, and watch the reverse happen. It seems like a zero-sum game to me. Usain bolt, posing because he won a competition. Study participants, stress levels up and down relative to one another. This is good advice in a competitive market, where there have to be winners and losers, alphas and betas, or even so far as bullies and victims. What will power posing do in a society where innovation and collective growth are the more important than being a pissing contest with another wannabe gorilla in the room.

My takeaways from this are: 
Exercise, power pose on your own, have some belief in what you do and get excited about pushing the world in a positive direction. Do NOT assert dominance or a false sense of confidence and assertiveness ""because decisions need to be made"" and then take credit because you made them. Maybe the person in the stressed pose has higher cortisol because they're burdened with the difficulty of that hard decision and all of the possible consequences, because they're actually thinking, and not just acting with false confidence because they think all confidence is apparently good. Not to mention the same hormonal profiles can lead to elevated cortisol or testosterone. Knowing how to have good posture is important, but being stressed  at times when thinking about something complex and important isn't always a bad thing."

It must be understood that not all people can carry on with an act, as it's totally not who they are and that could make them dependant on the act and not let others see who they really are, which could in the long term do more harm than good. I think it might be better to say to younger/shy/none confident people that this is just an act and that there are many ways to help with confidence building in a more natural and more individual way. I think the speaker played very well to the audience for sympathy, gaining a lot of support for her credibility but it would have been better to have just said I've been there, I understand. Not everyone has been in a car crash and had the car roll over 2 or 3 times, but most of us and especially the young have been through some traumatic experience in their lives. These experiences may not seem in some cases to be so profound or troublesome when we get older. Be yourselves, take some deep breaths, smile a lot, tell yourself, you'll be fine and try and be with people who make you happy and make you laugh."

""The superiority complex is one of the ways that a person with an inferiority complex may use as a method of escape from her or his difficulties. She or he assumes that she or he is superior when she or he is not, and this false success compensates her or him for the state of inferiority which she or he cannot bear. The normal person does not have a superiority complex, she or he does not even have a sense of superiority. She or he has the striving to be superior in the sense that we all have ambition to be successful; but so long as this striving is expressed in work it does not lead to false valuations, which are at the root of mental disease."""

In 2014, Eva Ranehill and other researchers tried to replicate this 
experiment with a larger group of participants and a double-blind setup.[18]
 Ranehill et al. found that power posing increased subjective feelings 
of power, but did not affect hormones or actual risk tolerance. They 
published their results in Psychological Science.[19]
Carney, Cuddy, & Yap responded in the same issue of Psychological Science,[20]
 with an overview of 33 published studies related to power posing, 
including the Ranehill et al. study. Almost all had reported significant
 effects of some kind. The overview noted methodological differences 
between their 2010 study[11] and the Ranehill replication, which may have moderated the effects of posing.[21]
Two statistics researchers at the Wharton School, Simmons & Simonsohn, later shared a meta-analysis of the same 33 studies on their statistics blog.[22] Based on the distribution of p-values reported across the studies (the 'p-curve'), they concluded that studies so far have demonstrated little to no average effect of power posing.[23]

UgidCci6iQiSp3gCoAEC,Kissin Rain,1472394595028,"I like how she said she identified with being smart and when her IQ lowered after her accident she felt powerless, yet she worked at making it through college even though it took longer,  then once she made it to Princeton, she felt like a fake, and was told to fake it till she became it, even if she was terrified. I can relate to this. There have been  things I've identified with that I've lost and have felt powerless as a result. Her story gives me hope.

UgiAlvi2N8H27XgCoAEC,ebonie thomas,1472394600318,"Amy Cuddy uses logos, Ethos, and pathos in this talk as well as being very didactic and clear with her words. Her Logos is represented when she didactically explains how women are more likely to feel less powerful than men and how people who feel prideful and happy. She uses Ethos when establishing that she is a social Psychologist so you know that she is very experienced in her field. The story that she mentions at the end of her talk was filled with Pathos when she describes how she made it through college and overcame her fear of speaking publicly by taking the advice that she mentioned at the beginning of the speech. When in debate last year, I watched this Ted Talk and took Cuddy’s advice and stood up in a “power” position for 2 minutes every time before I went up so I would be confident enough to produce a good speech. Thankfully this method worked and I ended up getting an “A”."

UgiLcncz5dlAFngCoAEC,Lindsey Anthony,1472394604450,"I learned a lot about confidence and stress. I learned what lower power poses and high power poses look like and what they signify. Watching this video provided me with an abundance of new information that I never looked at before, and had me question my own body language. 
I definetly agree that these minor tweaks can change how I react to stressful situations. In the moment of doing something stressful at work or during a speech if I put my hands on my hips I already feel more analytical, smarter, and more comfortable about what it is that I am doing or thinking about.  
This information could be useful for people taking a test, meeting new people, going to a big social event. Anywhere we go or anytime we feel uncomfortable and want to not feel that way, this knowledge could help us. This information could benefit everyone because the world is like the audience at her speech, trying to make themselves smaller or trying to retreat. Sometimes this is a good thing, however this is helpful to have as an option if you seek respond differently. Strengths of the speaker were that she had credible research and was a social psychologist and teaches at Harvard. The speaker had good sound knowledge of her topic, as well as having good main points attention grabber, transitions, and a conclusion were helpful. The speaker connected with her audience well and was passionate about her topic. 
I think to improve this speech she could have used a little bit less information that way she would not have been as rushed. Also her pacing and constant smile did distract me from the speech a tiny bit, she was stunning and a great speaker with a great message and content. Lastly I think her speech was excellent and the speaker did wonderful connecting, explaining and delivering her speech as a whole. I give her an A+."

People are ignorant and stupid and lazy so they try to simplify people b reading bodies instead investing in the deep intellectuality of those around them. 

For example if a person with down syndrome exhibits all the physical signs of confidence and power do we listen to them? No we do not  because we expect mental deficiency. But she needed a job and money so she did this. She has very little real intellectual value. But money, money, money."

Uggl9-srcaaWPXgCoAEC,Ronnie Wang,1472394620808,"I did not realize how amazing this speech is until it comes to 16:10 when she started to share her own story. It is not about how great the the story is or how great the way she told the story, but she finally become not nervous anymore. She talked without stops, repetition and looking down to the floor or her hand, she started to look at the audience and speak more fluently. The change is not because she remembers this part of speech better than other parts,  but you can feel that she really want to talk about that story and how big impact the story made on her. 

It is interesting because the topic of this speech is about body language of being powerful, and her own behavior just suits into the speech perfectly without herself maybe realizing that.When she finished her own story and came back to the final part of the talk, she went back to her initial way of giving the talk."

Regarding to faking, I have experienced it. When I was younger, I didn´t smile or change my facial expresions too much and my voice was monotone most of the time (friends, family and even teachers pointed these things out). Then I started to fake smiles and other facial expresions and paid more attention to my entonation. With the pass of time, those facial expressions and the entonation bacame natural to me."

I have been handling different personalities because of my job. There are some who kept in silence in front of the big people for instance to a boss or to many people that hey need to share their idea. sometimes they let the opportunity passed and kept it to themselves because they don't have the confidence to say or act like they have the right to claim the space as a result they are being over powered to those people who know how to carry themselves well even they are not so talented. Our society has a standard and feed us with such idea that the strong will survive and the weak will be always a sore loser on earth. The speaker did not say to pretend and create a completely different personality but convincing yourself and go out from the nutshell you used to be in. Sometimes we are fed by wrong things until we agreed to be like what the society has tagged us that's why we lose completely the identity that we must have. This speech is giving a voice to people who lack confidence and inspiring to do something to change their outlook in life not to teach us to be stupid and create a different personality.

The U.S. service academies have known and practiced this for decades. There were so many things drilled into me at the Air Force Academy that I later came to understand why we went through them. One of the more obvious was that we were conditioned to stand with our shoulders ""back and down."" Even when we were being chewed out by an upperclassman, we had to maintain the correct posture. And it worked to improve my self image. I grew up in a working class family where hunched shoulders was a common posture. Thank you Air Force Academy!

Considering that 2/8 women on my school’s asb (Student elected body) council are openly lesbian women, while the rest are straight men. Same thing applies to my school’s class officers: one of the five officers for my class are lesbian, and I keep on seeing the same trend in other grades as well.

Ugi2UpFHgXks0ngCoAEC,Maximiliano Mendes,1440772267368,"Incredible talk. I had the opportunity to show this video to some of my high school students and i noticed a few of them really identified themselves with this.

Anyways, I was thinking, in light of recent developments, would she receive a standing ovation if she dared threading the path of ""OK, how about this: are you a homossexual but not really satisfied? Interested on trying the other thing? Fake it untill you become  a heterosexual..."". 

What if it could work?"
UgilXqiSxNJKWXgCoAEC,Derek Newport,1440772267378,"The message in this video is dangerous ... Case in point, what happens if you are in the medical profession?  What happens if you are gay?  What happens if you are a soldier?"
UgiQePKBQVtdiHgCoAEC,Smart Tea,1440772267384,"When I was teaching elementary school, I would have my students do these ""confidence boosters"" right before they had to perform plays on stage.  We would power pose and do silly dances, and say tongue twisters to get our mouths moving and the nerves out. And it always worked!  When the kids performed, they were super confident, having fun, smiling more, and were less nervous!  I would always get honest feedback from parents and other teachers that the plays were the best they've ever seen, and that the kids shined!

Fast forward ten years later, and one of my students wrote to me, saying ""Teachers like you are gems.  You'll never know the impact you had simply by believing in me.""

So responding to some of these negative comments about ""Fake it til you make it"", it has nothing to do with being fraudulent about who you are.  It's about believing in yourself, even when you lack the confidence.  It's about making yourself become what you imagine yourself to be.  Creating your own self-fulfilling prophecy, right?

Sometimes it takes someone else believing in you in order for you to believe in yourself.  Why can't this someone else be ""you""?

I've seen the power of pep talks and power posing first hand on children. It works, in big and small ways, but it's significant and sometimes life-changing.

I love this presentation and its message, and I applaud Amy Cuddy."

UgjKp_CDmZTyC3gCoAEC,Serious Commenter,1440772275482,"FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS A 250 WORD SUMMARY

Amy Cuddy spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where body language serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Cuddy to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Cuddy. Cuddy later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Cuddy and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Cuddy returns to the house at 124, where body language has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.
Meanwhile, Cuddy has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in shapes, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom she was sold by schoolteacher. Her traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Cuddy and the other chain gang members to escape. She travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on body language’s porch in shape."

I like these words.

Confidence you can fake it by telling yourself that you are very smart and strong that can handle the tasks.  I always do that when I face problems. 
I don't know why there are some people think that she is telling you how to fake like a fraud or strut to others.  
No one else can eventually control your mind,  the one can do it is yourself. 
You can try to be offensive or rude to do these high power postures to anyone you want to.  But what you gain will be obivously a  short satisfaction and a intangible bad impression within your friends.

You are either a natural leader, or a follower. You are either good at something and have the confidence that comes with it, or you are just crap. You can't fake these with body language. People are not stupid and you can't fool them for a long time. I can suss you out in a nanosecond, no matter how fake you are. 
As for high power poses and low power poses…they are meaningless. You can't read someone's ability based on this. If you hire people based on where they put their arms and legs during and interview, you are fucked! Sometimes the most timid looking people are the smartest and best at what they are doing, and the confident looking chatty  ones are useless farts and full of hot air. They just come across as cocky and dumb.
And this is the problem with today's society, it's full of fakes and they get all the chances coz they are pushy and intimidating, while the quietly confident ones are pushed aside because they won't fake it.

حسنا اريد ان ابدأ بتقديم نصيحة مجانية وعملية لكم وكل ما هو مطلوب منكم هو التالي أن تغيروا وضعية جلوسكم لمدة دقيقتين لكن قبل أن أعطيكم نصيحتي.أريد أن أطلب منكم الان ان تراقبوا اجسامكم وتلاحظوا ما الذي تفعلونه بها حسنا، كم شخصا منكم ينكمش على جسده ويبدو أصغر؟ قد تكون منحني الظهر ، أو واضعا رجلا على رجل أو ربما تلف كاحليك مع بعضهم البعض أحيانا نمسك بذراعينا هكذا أحيانا نتوسع براحتنا (ضحك) أنا أراكم. (ضحك)(ضحك) اذاً أريدكم أن تلاحظوا جيدا ما الذي تفعلونه الان سنعود لهذه النقطة مره أخرى وآمل أنك إن تعلمت أن تعدل وضعيتك قليلا، فإن ذلك من الممكن أن يغير مسار حياتك بشكل كبير.

إذاً، نحن مفتونين بشدة بلغة الجسد، ونحن مهتمين تحديداً بلغة أجساد الاخرين. أتعلمون ،نحن مهتمين بأشياء غريبة مثلا (ضحك) بحركة محرجة أو ابتسامة، أو بنظرة ازدراء أو ربما غمزة غريبة جداً، أو ربما نهتم بشيئ مثل مصافحة.
1:22
الراوي: ها هم وصلوا إلى ""10 شارع دونينغ"" ،وانظر إلى هذا شرطي محظوظ تمكن من مصافحة الرئيس الولايات المتحدة , اوه ..وها هو يأتي رئيس الوزراء ..لا ؟ (ضحك) (تصفيق) (ضحك) .(تصفيق)
1:37
حسنا مصافحة ما أو عدم حدوث مصافحة قد تجعلنا نتحدث عن ذلك لأسابيع وأسابيع حتى ال""بي بي سي"" وال""نييورك تايمز"". لذا فإنه من الواضح أننا عندما نفكر في تعبير غير لفظي او لغة الجسد --لكن نحن نسميه تعابير غير لفظية كعلماء اجتماع. هي لغة بحد ذاتها ، فنحن نفكر بالتواصل وعندما نفكر بالتواصل ، نحن نفكر بالتفاعل اذن ما الذي توصله لغة جسدك لي؟ وما الذي توصله لغة جسدي إليك؟
2:04
كما أن هناك الكثير من الاسباب التي تجعلنا نعتقد أن هذه طريقة صحيحة للنظر الى ذلك ، لذا قضى علماء الاجتماع الكثير من الوقت يفحصون تأثير لغة جسدنا أو لغة جسد الاخرين على أحكامنا ونحن نصدر احكاماً شاملة ونستدل كثيرا على ما حولنا من خلال لغة الجسد. ومن خلال هذه الأحكام نستطيع توقع نتائج مهمة في حياتنا مثل من نوظف أو نرقي أو ممن نطلب الخروج في موعد. على سبيل المثال ""ناليني امبادي"" باحثة في جامعة تافتس، أشارت إلى أنه عندما يشاهد الناس 30 ثانية من مقاطع مسجلة بدون صوت. من التفاعل الحقيقي بين الطبيب والمريض، حكمهم على مستوى لطف الطبيب يشير إلى إذا ما ستتم مقاضاة هذا الطبيب أم لا. فذلك لا يتعلق بما إذا كان الطبيب كفء أم لا. لكنه يتعلق فيما اذا أعجبنا هذا الشخص أم لا وكيف تعامل هذا الشخص؟ ما يثير الدهشه أكثر ،اليكس تودروف من جامعة ""برنستون"" أشار إلى أن حكمنا على أوجه المرشحين السياسيين في ثانية واحدة فقط، ينبئ ب 70% من مجلس الشيوخ الامريكي وبنتائج سباق انتخابات رئيس الولايات المتحدة، وأيضاً، ...لنذهب رقمياً رموز تعابير الوجه الالكترونيه المستخدمه بشكل صحيح في المحادثات على الانترنت من الممكن ان تؤدي الى زيادة اثرائك لهذه المحادثة. اذا لم تكن تستخدمهم إلا قليلا..هذه فكرة سيئة، أليس كذلك؟ لذا فإننا حين نفكر في التعابير غير اللفظيه نحن نفكر في الحكم على الاخرين .وكيف يحكمون علينا وما هي النتائج؟ لكننا عادة ننسى الجمهور الاخر المتأثر بتعابيرنا غير اللفظيه ،والجمهور هذا هو أنفسنا
3:31
فنحن أيضا نتأثر بتعابيرنا غير اللفظيه، وأفكارنا ومشاعرنا ووظائف جسدنا الفسيولوجيه. إذن ما هي التعابير غير اللفظيه التي أتحدث عنها؟ أنا عالمة نفس اجتماعيه وأدرس التحيز والحكم المسبق. وأُدَرِس في إحدى كليات ادارة الأعمال المهمة، لذلك كان حتمياً اني سأكون مهتمه بديناميكيه السُلطة (قابلية تغيير السُلطة ) واصبحت مهتمة تحديدا بالتعابير غير اللفظيه الخاصة بالقوة والهيمنه.
3:56
وما هي التعبيرات غير اللفظية الخاصة بالقوة والهيمنه؟ حسنا ، هذه هي في مملكة الحيوانات ، هي متعلقة بالتوسع. لذا تضخم من نفسك وتتمدد، تحتل مساحة ،وأنت في الاساس تنفتح. لذا هو متعلق بالانفتاح وهذا صحيح في كل مملكة الحيوانات ،وهذا ليس مقتصراً على القرود فقط فالبشر يفعلون الشيء نفسه. (ضحك). وكلهم يفعلون هذا عندما يملكون قوة بشكل دائم وايضا عندما يشعرون بالقوة في لحظة معينة وهذه بالذات مثيرة للإهتمام لأنها ترينا كيف أن تعبيرات القوة عالمية وقديمة هذا التعبير المعروف بالشعور بالفخر درسته جيسكا تريسي وهي تظهر أن الأشخاص المبصرين منذ الولادة والأشخاص المكفوفين منذ الولادة يفعلون الشيء ذاته حين يربحوا في منافسة رياضية لذا فإنهم عندما يعبرون خط النهاية ويفوزون لا يهم إذا لم يروا أي احد من قبلهم يفعله هم يفعلون هذا فالذراعان مرفوعتان على شكل حرف ""V"" والذقن مرتفع قليلاً ماذا نفعل عندما نشعر بالضعف؟ ،نفعل العكس تماما ،ننغلق وننطوي على أنفسنا. ونصغر من حجمنا ،ولا نريد ان نتزاحم مع من هم بجانبنا. لذا مرة أخرى الحيوانات والبشر كلاهما يفعل الشيء ذاته. وهذا ما يحدث عندما تجمع قوة عالية وقوة دنيا. لذا ما نميل لفعله عندما يتعلق الامر بالقوة هو أننا نتكامل مع الاشارة غير اللفظية للاخرين. فاذا كان هنالك شخص ما، يتعامل معنا بقوة، نحن نميل الى أن نجعل انفسنا اصغر ، نحن لا نقلدهم نحن نفعل العكس معهم
5:24
وأنا أرى هذا السلوك في الفصل الدراسي، ماذا لاحظت؟ لاحظت أن طلاب ماجستير ادارة الأعمال يظهرون مجموعة كاملة من التعابير غيراللفظية التي تظهر القوة. لذلك لدينا أشخاص يشبهون حقا شخصيات ألفا، يأتون ويدخلون الى وسط القاعة حتى قبل بدء الحصة الدراسية، وكأنهم يريدون أن يحتلوا مساحة. وعندما يجلسون، وينتشرون نوعا ما ويرفعون أيديهم هكذا. ولديك أشخاص اخرين ينهارون فعليا حين يدخلون، وبمجرد دخولهم تستطيع رؤية هذا الانهيار. تراه في وجوههم وأجسامهم ، يجلسون على مقاعدهم ويجعلون من أنفسهم أصغر. ويفعلون هكذا عندما يرفعون أيديهم. قد لاحظت أمرين حول هذا السلوك. أولاً، ولن يكون مفاجاً يبدو أنه متعلق بنوع الجنس. فالنساء عادة يفعلون هذه التصرفات أكثر من الرجال النساء يشعرون بشكل دائم بأنهن اقل قوة وسلطة من الرجال. لذا فهذا لم يكن مفاجئا ، لكن هناك شيء آخر لاحظته يبدو أن له صلة إلى المدى الذي يشارك فيه الطلاب، وإلى مستوى جودة هذه المشاركات وهذا مهم جدا في فصول دراسة الماجستير لإدارة الاعمال، لأن نصف الدرجة النهائية يعتمد على المشاركة.
6:33
فكليات إدارة الاعمال تعاني من هذه الفجوة بين درجات الجنسين. يأتي اليك هؤلاء الرجال والنساء المتساوون بالمؤهلات وثم تحصل علي هذه الفجوة في الدرجات النهائية. ويبدو انه يتعلق جزئيا بالمشاركة. لذلك بدأت أتساءل، تعلمون ، حسنا أننا لدينا هؤلاء الاشخاص يدخلون بهذه الطريقة ويشاركون ،هل من الممكن ان نجعل الناس تتصنع هذا الشيء وهل من الممكن أن تقودهم ليشاركوا أكثر؟
6:57
لذا أنا و معاونتي الأساسية ""دانا كرنلي"" في جامعة ""بركلي"" كنا فعلا نريد أن نعرف، ""هل من الممكن أن تتَصَنُع هذا الشيء حتى تنجح فيه؟ مثل، هل من الممكن أن تفعل هذا السلوك لمدة قصيرة ثم تشعر فعلياً بمخرجات هذا السلوك الذي يجعلك تبدو اكثر قوة؟ فإذا نحن نعلم أن تعبيراتنا غير اللفظية تسيطر على الطريقة التي يشعر ويفكر فيها الناس اتجاهنا. وهناك الكثير من الأدلة. لكن السؤال بالواقع كان ،هل تعبيراتنا غير اللفظية تؤثر في الطريقة التي نشعر ونفكر فيها عن أنفسنا؟
7:24
هناك أدلة على أنها تؤثر. فمثلا نحن نبتسم عندما نشعر بالسعادة، لكننا أيضا عندما نجبر على أن نبتسم عندما نمسك بالقلم بأسنانا هكذا ، هذا يجعلنا نشعر بالسعادة. والشيء نفسه ينطبق على شعورنا بالقوة، فالأمر يسير بطريقتين ، فعندما تشعر بالقوة هناك احتمالية أكبر أن تتصرف بهذه الطريقة، لكن من الممكن أيضا أنك حين تتظاهر بالقوة، أنت على الأغلب ستشعر فعلياً بالقوة.
7:57
فالسؤال الثاني كان ، أنتم تعلمون نحن نعلم أن عقولنا تغير وتؤثر باجسامنا لكن هل صحيح أن أجسامنا تغير وتؤثر بعقولنا ؟ وعندما أقول عقول ، في هذه الحالة المتعلقة بالقوة، ما الذي أتحدث عنه بالضبط ؟ أنا أتحدث عن الأفكار والمشاعر ونوع من الامور الفيسيلوجية التي تشكل أفكارنا ومشاعرنا وفي هذه الحالة هي الهرمونات ، انا أنظر الى الهرمونات إذا كيف تختلف عقول الأشخاص الأقوياء مقابل عقول الأشخاص الأقل قوة؟ فالأشخاص الأقوياء يميلون إلى أن يكونوا..""وهو غير مفاجئ"" أكثر حزماَ وثقة وتفاؤلاَ هم في الحقيقة يشعرون بأنهم سيفوزون حتى في الأمور المتعلقة بالصدفة والحظ هم أيضاَ يميلون إلى أن يكونوا أكثر قدرة على التفكير بتجرد. إذاَ هنالك الكثير من الاختلافات.هم أكثر مجازفة هناك اختلافات كثيرة بين الأشخاص الأقوياء والأقل قوة. وحتى من الناحية الفيسيولوجية يوجد أيضاَ اختلافات بين هرمونين أساسين، هما: التستوسترون، وهو هرمون السيطرة والكورتيزول، الهرمون المسؤول عن التوتر إذا فقد توصلنا إلى الآتي الذكور أصحاب القوة والذين في المراتب العليا من الهرم تكون نسبة التيستوسترون مرتفعة لديهم والكورتيزول منخفضة والأمر ذاته عند القادة الأقوياء والمؤثرين تيستتوستيرون مرتفع والكورتيزول منخفض. إذا ما الذي يعني ذلك؟ عندما نفكر بالقوة فإن الناس يميلون إلى التفكير فقط بالتيستوستيرون لأن ذلك يكون متعلقاَ بالسيطرة لكن حقيقة، القوة متعلقة أيضا بكيف نتصرف مع التوتر إذا هل أنت تريد أن تكون ذلك القائد ذو القوة الكبيرة المسيطرة، ونسبة تيستوستيرون مرتفعة، لكنك متجاوب مع التوتر؟ على الأرجح لا، صحيح؟ فأنت تريد أن تكون شخصاَ قوياَ وجازماَ ومسيطراَ ولكنك غير متجاوب مع التوتر، الشخص الهادئ.
9:37
لذا نعلم أن في الهرم البدائي، لو ألفا يحتاج أن يسيطر، لو شخص يريد أن يأخذ دور الألفا على نحو يعتبر مفاجئ خلال أيام قليلة، هرمون التسترون لهذا الشخص ارتفع بشكل ملحوظ وهرمون والكورتيزول انخفض بشكل ملحوظ. إذا لدينا هذا الدليل، بأن مثلما الجسد بإمكانه تشكيل العقل، على الأقل على المستوى السطحي فكذلك هذه التغييرات الأساسية بإمكانها تشكيل العقل. لذا ماذا يحصل، حسناً، خُذ دور تغيير، ما الذي يحدث إذا قمت هذا الشيئ على المستوى البسيط جداً، مثل هذا التلاعب البسيط، هذا التدخل البسيط؟ ""لمدة دقيقتين"" "" أريد منك أن تقف هكذا وهذا من شأنه أن يجعلك تشعر أكثر قوة""
10:19
إذا فهذا ما كنا نفعله. قررنا أن نحضر أشخاصا إلى المختبر وإجراء تجربة صغيرة، وهؤلاء الأشخاص تبنوا، لمدة دقيقتين، وضعيات يكونون فيها إما بحالة قوة عالية أو قوة منخفضة، وسأريكم الآن خمسة من تلك الوضعيات، على الرغم من اتخاذهم وضعيتين فقط هذه واحدة من تلك الوضعيات. ووضعين آخرين. هذه تم اطلاق عليها اسم ""المرأة المعجزة"" من قبل الإعلام وهنا وضعين آخرين. إذا فمن الممكن أن تكون واقفاَ أو جالساَ. وهنا وضعيات القوة الضعيفة لذا فأنت تنطوي على نفسك، تجعل نفسك أصغر. هذه تمثل بالضعف فعندما تلمس رقبتك فأنت تقوم فعلياً بحماية نفسك إذا فهذا الذي حدث، يأتون يبصقون في زجاجة، ونخبرهم بأن عليهم خلال دقيقتين عمل هذا أو ذاك لا ينظرون إلى صور وضعيات. لا نريد أن نعدهم مسبقاً بمفهوم للقوة، أردناهم أن يشعروا بالقوة، صحيح؟ لذا فقد قاموا بذلك لمدة دقيقتين ثم قمنا بسؤالهم ""قيّم شعورك بالقوة؟"" في عدة مواقف متتابعة ومن ثم إتاحة الفرصة لهم للتخمين، وثم نأخذ عينة أخرى من اللعاب. وهذا كل شيئ. هذه كانت التجربة كاملة.
11:28
لذا هذا ما توصلنا إليه، تحمل المخاطر، الذي توصلنا إليه أنك حين تكون في وضعيات القوة الكبيرة القوة الكبيرة ، 86 بالمائة سيغامر وعندما تكون في وضعيات القوة الضعيفة فقط 60 بالمائة. وهذا فرق كبير جداً وهذا الذي توصلنا إليه بالنسبة للتيستوستيرون من تقييمهم المبدئي في بداية حضورهم، ذوي القوة الكبيرة حصلوا على زيادة 20% ، وذوي القوة الضعيفة حصوا على انخفاض بنسبة 10 بالمائة. لذا مرة أخرى، دقيقتين، وستتمكن من الحصول على هذه التغييرات هذا ما ستحصل عليه بالنسبة للكورتيزول. الأشخاص ذو القوة الكبيرة يحصلون على انخفاض بالكورتيزول بنسبة 25 بالمائة والأشخاص ذو القوة الضعيفة يحصلون على ارتفاع 15 بالمائة في نسبة الكورتيزول. إذا دقيقتان تقودان إلى هذه التغيرات في الهرمونات مما يجعل عقلك إما جازم، واثق و مرتاح أو متجاوب مع التوتر، وأنت تعلم احساس الانغلاق. وكلنا أحسسنا بهذا الاحساس، صحيح؟ لذا يبدو أن لغتنا غير اللفظية تقوم فعلا بالسيطرة على طريقة تفكيرنا وشعورنا اتجاه أنفسنا وليست فقط اتجاه الآخرين، ولكن حتى على أنفسنا أيضا، أجسادنا تغير عقولنا
12:36
لكن السؤال التالي بالتأكيد، هو هل من الممكن اتخاذ وضعيات قوة لبضع دقائق أن تغير حياتك بطريقة أفضل؟ كان ذلك في المختبر، وكانت هذه المهمة الصغيرة، تعلمون هي فقط لمدة دقيقتين، وأين يمكنك فعلا تطبيق هذا؟ هذا بالتأكيد ما يهمنا. أعني ذلك ما يعنينا حيث تتمكن من تطبيق هذه المواقف المتوقعة أي المواقف التي تتعرض فيها إلى تهديد إجتماعي، حيث يتم تقييمك حتى لو من قبل أصدقاءك، مثلا على طاولة غرفة الغداء بالنسبة للمراهقين من الممكن أن تكون لبعض الأشخاص التحدث في اجتماع مجلس الإدارة للجامعة، من الممكن أن يكون إلقاء خطاب أو إلقاء حديث كهذا أو القيام بمقابلة عمل. ومن ثم قررنا أن الموقف الذي يتعلق بأغلب الناس لأن أكثر الناس يمرون به هو المقابلة الوظيفية.
13:20
لذا قمنا بنشر هذه النتائج، والإعلام اهتم بها، وقالوا بالإعلام، حسنا، هذا ما تفعله عند ذهابك إلى مقابلة عمل، أليس كذلك؟ (ضحك) حسنا، نحن بالتأكيد نشعر بالرعب، ونقول يا إلهي، لا، لا، لا، ليس هذا ما نعنيه على الإطلاق لأسباب عظيمة، لا لا لا، لا تفعل ذلك مرة أخرى، هذا ليس متعلقاَ بك عند التحدث للآخرين إنه متعلق بك أنت، بحديثك لنفسك، ما الذي تقوم به قبل ذهابك إلى مقابلة عمل؟ هذا ما تقوم به صحيح؟ تقوم بالجلوس. تنظر في هاتفك الآيفون أو الأندرويد، لا اريد ان لا أشمل احداً وتنظرإلى ملاحظاتك وتجلس محنياً، جاعلاً من نفسك أصغر حجماً، في الوقت الذي ما يتوجب عليك فعله هو هذا مثلا، في دورة المياه، صحيح؟. قم بفعل ذلك، عليك أن تجد دقيقتين. حسناً، فذلك ما نريد اختباره. اتفقنا؟ لذا قمنا بإحضار أشخاص إلى المختبر وقاموا باتخاذ وضعيات قوة أو ضعف مرة مجدداً، ومن ثم قيامهم بمقابلة عمل يتعرضون فيها إلى ضغط شديد، مدتها خمسة دقائق. وتم تصويرهم خلالها. وتم الحكم عليهم، والحكام مدربون على ألا يظهروا أي أفعال غير لفظية فكانوا يظهرون هكذا، تخيل بأن يقوم هذا الشخص بإجراء مقابلة معك إذا هكذا لمدة خمسة دقائق، لا شيء، وهذا أسوأ من أن يتم مقاطعتك بالكلام فالناس يكرهون هذا. وهذا ما تدعوه ماريان لافرانس ""الوقوف على رمال إجتماعية متحركة"" لذا هذا الموقف يرفع نسبة الكرتيزول عندك بشكل كبير. لذا فهذه هي مقابلات العمل التي وضعناهم خلالها لأننا أردنا أن نعلم ما الذي سيحدث حقيقة بعد ذلك جعلنا مبرمجين ينظرون لتلك التسجيلات، أربعة منهم. وكانوا المبرمجين جاهلين تماما للفرضية، ويجهلون الظروف. ولم يكن لديهم أي فكرة عن الوضعية وفي النهاية كانوا يشاهدون هذه التسجيلات ويقولون ""إننا نريد أن نعين هؤلاء الأشخاص"" كل المتخذين وضعيات القوة --"" لا نريد تعيين هؤلاء الأشخاص"" "" نحن أيضاً نقيم هؤلاء الأشخاص بصورة ايجابية أكثر بكثير من الآخرين"". لكن ما الذي قادهم إلى هذا؟ إنه غير متعلق بمضمون الحديث بل هو متعلق بالمظهر الذي أظهروه خلال الحديث نحن أيضا، لأننا نقيمهم على أساس كل هذه المتغيرات التي لها علاقة الجدارة، مثل ما مدى جودة ترتيب الحديث؟ جودة الحديث؟ وما هي مؤهلاتهم؟ لا تأثير على هذه الأشياء. هذا الشيء المتأثر هذه الأشياء. الأشخاص يحضرون ما هم حقيقة عليه أساساً. يحضرون أنفسهم. يحضرون أفكارهم، ولكن على أنهم هم من غير، كما تعلمون، بقايا عليهم. لذا هذا ما يحرك المؤثر، أو ما يوصل التأثير
15:35
لذا، عندما أقوم بإخبار الناس عن هذا بان أجسادنا تغير عقولنا، وأن عقولنا يمكن أن تغير تصرفاتنا وتصرفاتنا بإمكانها تغيير نتائجنا، يقولون لي: "" لا أستطيع، أشعر بأن هذا خداع"" أليس كذلك؟ لذا كنت أقول لهم: تظاهروا بها إلى أن تتقنوها. لا أريد. هذا ليس أنا لا أريد أن أصل إلى هناك ومن ثم أشعر وكأنني نصاب لا أريد أن أشعر بانني مدعي. لا أريد أن أصل إلى هناك فقط لأشعر بأنني لا أستحق بأن أكون هنا. وهذا حقيقة ما كان له صدى لدي. لأنني سأخبركم قصة صغيرة عن أن تكون محتالاً وتشعر بأنك لا تستحق أن تكون بهذا المكان.
16:06
حدث ذلك حين كنت في التاسعة عشرة من عمري، حيث تعرضت إلى حادث سيارة سيء للغاية حيث ألقيت خارج السيارة، وتدحرجت عدة مرات. رميت خارج السيارة، واستيقظت وقد أصبت برأسي في قسم التأهيل، وقد تم فصلي من الجامعة وعلمت لاحقاً أن درجة ذكائي لامتحان الذكاء قد انخفضت درجتين والذي شكل بالنسبة لي صدمة وكنت على علم بدرجة ذكائي، لأنه تم تحديد درجتي على أنني من الأذكياء وكانوا يلقون علي لقب الموهوبة وانا طفله لذا فقد تم فصلي من الجامعة، وقد بقيت أحاول العودة لها وكانوا يقولون لي""لن تتمكني من إنهاء الجامعة"" حسنا، انتي تعلمين ان هناك أشياء أخرى يمكنك فعلها لكن هذا لن يعمل في صالحك لذا فأنا حقا قد كافحت ، ولذلك يحب ان اقول حين يتم سحب هويتك منك، هويتك الأصلية وبالنسبة لي كان أن أكون ذكية انتزاع كل ذلك منك، ليس هنالك شيء يجعلك تشعر بالضعف أكثر من ذلك لذا فقد شعرت أنني ضعيفة بالكاملة، وعملت وعملت وعملت وحالفني الحظ، وعملت وحالفني الحظ وعملت
17:01
وفي النهايه تخرجت من الجامعة. لقد تطلب مني ذلك أربعة سنين زيادة عن باقي أقراني وأقنعت شخصاً، ملاكي ومرشدتي، هي سوزان فيسك أن تأخذني وانتهى بي الحال إلى برينيستون وقد كان شعوري، انا لا أستحق أن أكون هناك أنا محتالة. وفي الليلة التي تسبق حديثي للسنة الأولى وحديث السنة الأولى في برينستون هو لمدة 20 دقيقة أمام عشرين شخصاً. وذلك كل شيء كنت خائفة جداً أن أجد نفسي في الخارج في اليوم التالي فقمت بالاتصال بها وإخبارها، ""أنا أستقيل"". وكانت ردة فعلها كذلك، "" لن تستقيلي"" لأنني قد راهنت عليك، وأنت ستبقين أنت ستبقين، وكل ما عليك فعله هو أن تتظاهري. عليك بأن تقومي بأداء كل حديث يطلب منك القيام به. ما عليك إلا أن تقومي به مرة تلو الأخرى. حتى لو كنت تشعرين بالرعب والعجز عن القيام به ومرورك بتجربة خارج جسدك ، وذلك إلى أن تأتي هذه اللحظة التي ستقولين فيها، ""يا إلهي، أنا أفعلها لقد أصبحت ما أريد، أنا فعلاً أقوم به لذا ذلك ما فعلته، أمضيت 5 أعوام في جامعة وخلال أعوام قليلة، أنا في جامعة ""نورثويسترن"" انتقلت إلى جامعة ""هارفرد""، أنا في هارفرد، لم أعد أفكر بهذا مجددا، لكن أمضيت وقتا طويلا أفكر ""لا أستحق أن أكون هنا، لا أستحق أن أكون هنا""
18:07
وفي نهاية السنة الأولى لي في هارفرد طالبة، لم تتكلم في الصف لمدة فصل دراسي كامل والتي أخبرتها: ""انظري عليك أن تشاركي وإلا سوف ترسبين"" وجاءت إلى مكتبي. وحقاً لم أكن أعرفها مطلقاً. وقالت لي، وهي في حالة انهزامية تماما، وقالت ""أنا لا أستحق أن أكون هنا"" وكانت هذه اللحظة بالنسبة لي، لأن أمرين قد حدثا الأول هو أنني أدركت ""يا إلهي، أنا لم اعد اشعر بذاك الشعور لم أعد أشعر بذلك مجدداً، لكنها هي تشعر بذلك، وأعلم كيف يكون هذا الشعور والثاني، بأنها تستحق أن تكون هنا هي تستطيع أن تتظاهر بذلك، إلى أن تصبح ذلك لذا أخبرتها: ""بلى، أنت كذلك، أنت يجب أن تكوني هنا"" وغدا، ستتظاهرين بذلك، أنت ستجعلين نفسك قوية، أنت ستصبحي- (تصفيق) (تصفيق) وستذهبين إلى الصف وسوف تقومين بإلقاء تعليقك على الموضوع، وسيكون الأفضل على الإطلاق أتعلمون؟ وقد ألقت أفضل تعليق على الإطلاق والتفت الجميع، وكانوا مندهشين. إننا لم نلاحظ حتى جلوسها هناك! (ضحك)
19:13
وعادت لي بعد مضي عدة أشهر، وأدركت أنها لم تتظاهر بها حتى قامت بها فحسب، بل هي في الحقيقة تظاهرت بها حتى أصبحت ما تريد لذا هي تغيرت وما أريد أن أقوله لكم. لا تتظاهروا به إلى أن تقوموا به بل تظاهروا به إلى أن تصبحوا فعلا كذلك. قم بذلك بشكل كاف حتى تصبح كذلك، وتستوعبه
19:33
والشيء لأخير الذي أود أن أترككم معه هو هذا إن التعديلات الصغيرة جداً بإمكانها أن تقودكم إلى تغييرات عظيمة. لذا هي فقط دقيقتين. دقيقتين، دقيقتين، دقيقتين قبل ذهابك إلى موقف موتر وتتعرض فيه إلى أن يتم تقييمك فقط لمدة دقيقتين، حاول أن تقوم بهذا، في المصعد في دورة المياه، في مكتبك خلف الأبواب الموصدة هذا ما يجب أن تفعله، هيء عقلك لتواجه بالشكل الأفضل هذا الموقف. اجعل التسترون يرتفع. اجعل الكرتوزول ينخفض. لا تترك الموقف باحساس أنك ،اوه، لم ارهم من أنا اترك الموقف باحساس أنك تحس أنك كان من المفترض أن تعبر عن نفسك وتريهم من أنت.
20:09
لذا أريد أن أطلب منكم أولاً أن تجربوا وضعيات القوة. وأريد أن أطلب منكم أيضاً أن تشاركوا العلم، لأن هذا الشيء بسيط. ليس لدي غرور متورط في هذا الشيء. (ضحك) انشروه. شاركوه مع الناس، لأن الناس الذين يحتاجونه كثيراً هم الأشخاص الذين لا يملكون مصادر ولا تكنولوجيا ولا منصب ولا قوة. أعطوهم إياه. لأنهم يستطيعون عمله في خلوتهم يحتاجون أجسامهم، خصوصية ودقيقتان ويمكنها بشكل ملحوظ تغيير مخرجات حياتهم. شكرا لكم. (تصفيق) (تصفيق)"

Myself personally I am a postulator of all types of body language...receptive, aggressive and mirroring.  I believe I accord this to what is the context of my comfort and the familiarity of the situation.  This short expo is based on more than inner thoughts and social indices but how we can apply our ingrained responses by being aware of our ability to convey/communicate with greater affect. We can be me more than the initial fear. Who hasn't felt small being the first one in line at the buffet? Ummmm...yeah right! I've never been the first one either..why? Self conscience .Of what ...perception what else.  We all do this every day in more un ingratiating ways. Body language is the most observed behaviour, by all human's including those most intimate to us. Don't underestimate its capacity to influence perception of who you are."
UgjDn6CQCTVY_ngCoAEC,John Doe,1440772332248,"I can tell by her body language that she ""may"" have insecurities with her looks.  Arms are too thin so she wears a sweater and folds the sleeves half way up to give the impression that she's not (still shows a little bit of skin).  Huge necklace covering up something; maybe excess skin in the neck or thin neck.  Hair covering one of her eyes.  Giving off a ""mysterious"" maybe even sexy look or is it that she's stage shy?.  Keeps flailing her arms to continuously get your attention to her.  Spoken word is one thing.  Spoken word and arm waiving adds to get your attention (can be distracting though).   Black outfit masks shape of her body.  Is it because she's thin?  In the end, who really knows anything!!  If you're so worried about how other people see and perceive you, you just may have bigger problems than body language."

Postures do have  effect on the  breathing pattern and the  energy  flow. ""Power Pose""  has its  good effects.

When  the Chest  opens up,  the  breathing  becomes  more deep,  and  more  abdominal  breathing.

 More abdominal breathing  better oxygen  absorption and  more  oxygen in the blood  stream. You feel   more  energetic and  positive.

Yogic poses  like Chakrasana (Wheel Pose), Dhanurasana ( Bow Pose), Matsyasana(Fish Pose), Simhasana (Lion Pose) help in  opening  the  chest and  improve the posture.  These  Asanas are prescribed  for  people  undergoing  Depression and  Anxiety problems."

You inspire greatness to women in academia!  Outstanding piece - I offer my highest recommendation., strongest endorsement!!

Social psychologist Amy Cuddy, Associate Professor at Harvard Business School, uses experimental methods to investigate how people judge and influence each other and themselves. Her research suggests that judgments along two critical trait dimensions – warmth/trustworthiness and competence/power – shape social interactions, determining such outcomes as who gets hired and who doesn’t, when we are more or less likely to take risks, why we admire, envy, or disparage certain people, elect politicians, or even target minority groups for genocide."

It generally causes a lot of confusion in other people (therefore fun) if, for instance, you are happy but present yourself as sad (or the other way around), are feeling powerful but present yourself as powerless, etc.
They spend more time hearing and looking at you, and you can almost feel their subconscious confusion in the air. 

So this video come as a great thing to me since it explains a lot of different effects of this weird hobby I used to have, especially because the ""fake"" poses I used to make actually affected my mind (mood/thoughts/feelings). That's awesome.

I wanted to troll and test other people but I was actually trolling myself and being confused of why my 'internal state' changed after the conversation/exchange."

Science and reasoning has got to be the worst thing humans can ever think as being edifying.  This is typical of a extroverted dominated world who view life as a evolving species and that need to achieve a higher sense of perfection. If you are not born with a particular set of genes and extroverted personality, you are the scum of the earth and need to be put down like a dog. Your genes need not pass on. 4 million views of solid evidence of how reprobate man has become over the course of God's experiment and more evidence that mankind's philosophy and wisdom is foolishness. It goes to show that people in today's society are no more than self serving and hypocritical with zero values and understanding of the purpose of life.

We are a species, to them, of apes who got lucky and are ever evolving into a wonderful and magnificent species. Who can be like us. One day we will achieve God like status and even be like gods. People used to make fun of spoon fed children; I make fun of television propaganda liberalized high minded ego centered so called adults who view reading someone's body language as what dictates who they are inside and disregard anything that may be inside of them that they were unable to present in this so called scientific study of a human being displaying his self image in a way that must be presented in their so called scientific manner. And if you do not agree than you are unlearned and stuck in a box that doesn't understand the beauty and intelligence of scientific study. RA RA EXTROVERT RA RA EXTROVERT RA RA EXTROVERT.

I had a job interview last week for a well paid financial analyst position, and was incredibly nervous.  Taking on board Amy's advice I got there early and did my 'ten to two' reach up power pose for 20 minutes in the toilet cubicle thinking I'd be ten times more powerful than the 2 minutes she originally recommended(I'm an analyst after all).

However when it came to go and smash the interview, I found I had managed to lock into that pose. I cursed my poor fortune and paralysed body. I couldn't bend enough to unlock the door so I had to struggle to slither under the gap like some sorry kind of business python who's swallowed a large catapult, and damp toilet paper already on the floor ended up sticking to my suit and forehead. 

As you can imagine the interview went less than ideally with me standing(I was unable to sit) in front of the stern 3 person panel; looking inexplicably like someone who overly loves the first movement of Village People's Y.M.C.A. dance, and to top it having off a fetish for toilet paper. The piece of tissue dangling from my forehead fluttered up every time I spoke. Trying to explain that this was all down to watching a one eyed woman on youtube give a talk on low self-esteem did not seem to help my predicament.

The experience was so traumatizing that I haven't left the house since and feel my social anxiety is now worse than ever. Amy, I am absolutely livid."

It is far too easy to focus on criticizing someone else who has taken the big risks. It takes far more courage, creativity, and substance to actually create your own work and go put yourself out there in front of the masses to put your skills and knowledge to the test on a very public scale. Part of her message was to take command of yourself and simply direct yourself to do something, meaning the actual results don't have to be perfect, but you certainly can succeed at your basic goal.

Ugj3O2wS_zVQUngCoAEC,Hector Flores,1409236395408,"I have an inconvenience with this. I'm ok with taking the facts as they are, which is, descrptions of real phenomena. However I'm concerned with how is this interpreted and applied. First, I'm not so sure that everytime you're in a low-power pose you're feeling unconfident, so, it would be erroneus to assume anything about an individual just because his/ her back is not straight. It could be perhaps mostly a physiological thing (on my part I used to play a lot of video games and without having proper support for my back, it hunched a bit) until people start making assumptions about what is going on in the inside. Second, if posture is influencing at job interviews, then you're taking something that could very well boost a person's confidence away and also I'm not so sure hat you can determine if a person will fail you as an employee by reading body language, I now that it's not just that factor in interviews but it seems that giving a person a chance regardless it sort of a gamble some companies can afford, maybe their lack of risk taking should be interpreted as a lack of confidence. If not, maybe caution or lack of risk-taking should not be interpreted a lacking in SELF-confidence, maybe you lack confidence in your enviroment which is the reason for caution everywhere in the anymal kingdom. So, one would not be so quick to judge, and don't even get me started on extroverted social behavior, this and body language are being taken too seriously. Favoring certain charasteristics is also favoring the phenomena that causes them, so think before you make an assumption about what a person has on his/her head."

UgiDHPnGf8FLs3gCoAEC,Crystal Bishop,1409236430542,"to the buried comment referencing her ""training psychopaths"", not once did she mention adapting antisocial behavior and a lack of empathy to your life, her whole message is about empowering yourself to be the best whatever you wanna be by hedging a bet that if you believe in yourself it will happen. another hallmark of psychopathy is the manipulation of people for your own good, which is why non-violent sociopaths are some of the most successful people in their fields. the difference is the motivation. sociopaths are motivated by external rewards, money, power, recognition, because they don't really have feelings (the business card scene from american psycho sticks out in my mind) like ""regular"" people. faking it til you become it is a message rooted in loving yourself and believing in yourself. psychopaths learn early in life how to manipulate people, they don't need to watch a video of an emotional woman who has been through some shit to fake fitting in."

 And yes - talking/thinking about something doesn't change your body chemistry, or at least in the way you are intending for it to change.. It's the body position that gets the message across and that is the basic of yoga for example..
 Getting a flexible body gives you a flexible mind - even if you are not creative at all and you find it hard to react in certain situations..
 Getting durable gives you more energy for your daily tasks..
 Getting strong let's you more easily overcome some more intensive moments in your daily lives..

High T can also lead to baldness (in addition to hair growth) and acne. We're much more aggressive lovers and a lot less moody.

Anxious, quiet, fumbling over words, not being able to think... I was a mess. Then I started doing the power pose for 2 minutes before I'd go see a patient. The difference is incredible. I speak up, I make eye contact, I feel confident. I never thought something so simple could make such a difference."

The thing is many motivational speakers and behavioural analysts talk a lot about beliefs, posture, attitude, because these things are easy to change. But powerful people, successful people normally have things like talent, knowledge, intelligence or money, and their posture/confidence are a consequence of that. People who have a body language of inferiority do so because they know their are inferior in these matters. So you can fake it for so long, but eventually you have to back it up."

This leads me to believe she is much more comfortable behind data than she is in front of large groups of people. I bet she's an introvert with extrovert tendencies."

Even before she gave her anecdote you can tell she is convinced of something and wants to share this idea that changed her own life. I don't know...just my point of view.
Ugz56vBV-LflNmDccqV4AaABAg,skye1899,1377700535831,I feel she is so passionate about what she is saying.

UgwYpRpv9_12xaHGWfh4AaABAg,babybluecebu,1377700541144,A few years ago I decided to start sitting like a man with my ankle crossed over my knee instead of like the typical woman with knee over knee. I usually don't wear a skirt or dress so it's not a problem. I figured that women have been taught to not take up space and men have been taught the opposite. It definitely makes me feel more powerful and like I can hold my own with men in my high school and now college class rooms.

In my opinion we should discover who we are and build on that, creating oneself endlessly. Fake usually has drastically negative results in the long run,don't lie to yourself,cuz then what wont u lie about if u aren't honest with yourself?"

UgzwD0NjIfIzQWV0VVp4AaABAg,A.,1377700600118,"I don't think you understand the gravity of it... Faking a sincere emotional expression, so good, it's nearly psychopathic. It's like, in a conversation, someone is smiling warmly to you, telling you how much he's enjoying the conversation without being sincere. It's a lie. And believe, its not so eay the ""fake it become it"", more introspectiv people would never be able to do such things. Don't think straight."
UgxRqvm_xaEz8IMSNcB4AaABAg,ChantMediaOrg,1377700600129,"On a related note, trial lawyers who are perfectly healthy have been known to take blood pressure medication because it lowers the heart rate and makes them appear confident and consequently persuasive to a jury.  I don't believe there are any adverse health effects to doing this and yet I find something a little offensive about it.  But anyway, if you think the speaker is offering valuable advise, hope it works for you."
UgwOm306d-ONF4W96qJ4AaABAg,VadKog,1377700600135,"Well, that is your viewpoint. But it seems like there is significant data (that she presents) to support the opposite. It's not that she is saying a generalized statement without any tangible advice like ""body language informs the way people perceive others."" I agree that knowing that and having no practical way to utilize that information would cause even more stress, at a job interview, etc. But, she does give the viewer practical advice. Poses to go into, a time interval to go into them."
UgwfP3sOsSifjy_QmWd4AaABAg,ChantMediaOrg,1377700600142,"I don't believe it was some sort of pretend assertive ""alpha"" behavior that created the empathy in her mentor to help her.  I actually believe that in situations such as job interviews or public speaking the problem is that initially people become afraid and self conscious because they just don't know what to expect, its all new to them.  I think this advice to focus on body language just makes people even more self conscious in these situations and is counter productive."
UgxgKPk2ap05G8IRH9R4AaABAg,VadKog,1377700600153,"That may be, but significant fluctuations in hormone levels based on posture and facial expression are not something to be ignored or taken lightly. They are not superfluous and should be researched. And the outcome of the experience she related Made her into a person who would not quit, Through imitation of assertive people. That imitation as a vector for self-change (whether it is body language or something else) is what is critical to her point."
Ugz7P9NrEYI8hLOwuqJ4AaABAg,ChantMediaOrg,1377700600157,"I don't think you understand, the significant experience she related was someone giving her the courage not to quit and then she did the same for someone else.

UgzEjPINBhqNLbZM7VZ4AaABAg,VadKog,1377700600166,"They do. The presentation is about posing in the way a typically successful person would already pose, in order to feel like you are successful.

Acting annoyed and critical, or happy and carefree train you to better continue to act in these ways, as well as experience the associated emotions. As well, the way people react to us seems to change as soon as we change the way we behave with them, which in turn chages us in actuality.

Ugy_4jmA2L5OvOBdQsp4AaABAg,Hackney James,1377700610363,"I am not ""dissing"" Tony Robbins, and, quite to the contrary, what I am saying is that it is NOT a person's degree which provides credibility to an idea, but instead the quality of the evidence.  I am happy that Tony Robbins reads and uses the scientific evidence in shaping and supporting his ideas, more people should. My actual point is, just because an idea makes sense does not mean scientific testing is unneeded; nor, if it IS supported by the evidence, was the testing wasted effort."

And the compilation of scientific evidence is done through statistical analysis from case data correct? Well, that's what Robbins does. So in essence he does the same thing a scientist (or a psychologist) would do, but without the PhD and lab coat.  Here he is doing a TED talk.    /watch?v=_x1jJvp1ERs"
Ugy7AyPuI1gEwj7n9Wt4AaABAg,Oliver Witherspoon,1377700610424,"See! There ya go. You're proving my point. The assumption that because Tony Robbins doesn't have a PhD, his findings are only a good idea and not scientifically supported. But the truth is, Robbins has stacks of scientific evidence. Obviously, I'm kind of a supporter of his, but only because I've put this stuff to practice in my own life for years and seen the results."
Ugy-7EFptk32wWC8pbB4AaABAg,Hackney James,1377700610436,"It isn't the PhD which makes the difference, it's the scientifically supported evidence.  There are a lot of ideas which make conceptual sense, but sometimes they turn out not to be true.  In science, one of the things we do is test the evidence underlying such assumptions; if the ideas are empirically supported, then you have stronger proof just somebody saying it without evidence."

Firstly, we have to remember that the environment we live in today is radically different to the one we evolved for. Also, we didn't evolve as individuals, but in a group/tribe. Best guess- these groups would have benefited from both submissive individuals who got on with the hard work, as well as high minded leaders. However, today's society values individuals with traits typically associated with the leaders."

They represent how someone recharges: extroverts recharge by being in social environments - dinners with families, conversations with friends, even online forums; and introverts recharge by being alone. I think it's ARROGANT of you to state that ""introversion is more powerful in changing the world"", because you're essentially degrading the counter-term (extroversion) to gain a foot-hold."

Anyways, shy people are typically extroverts who are afraid to obtain what they desire. Have you ever seen a shy person come out of their shell? If you have you know they can be louder than the typical extrovert. A lot of people find them rather annoying, that's why they are shy in the first place.

Introverts remain concise and quiet regardless; a demeanor sometimes called low-key, cool, etc."

You can be both shy and introverted and introverts usually exhibit shy behavior. As an example people who were shy in their younger years often are more introverted. The two behaviors usually go hand in hand. A ""lone wolf"" is the exception, and also not really consistent with reality. Almost no one prefers to truly be by themselves, whether they want to admit it or not."

You can either resign yourself to a life of mediocrity, blaming it on the unfairness of anti-introvert bias, or actually try and get yourself out there.

Either way, you win so be happy with that."
Ugw-_BE_XDhLKsu5kAV4AaABAg,Michael Miller,1377700635869,"I also noticed the breathing and the 'running' about amongst other things. I think it was more noticeable because this was her topic. 

Immediately, people will naturally expect more from her as an example and be slightly less forgiving concerning her 'mistakes' due to her area of 'expertise'. In other words, practicing what is preached and walking the talk so to speak."

I would presume, I am able to comprehend the difference between Walking and running, as my second subject at University is Anglistics. I see it as running around hysterically, what she does, you view it as the casual nstroll, a good orator will take on the stage. What about just keeping it there and not talk about it anymore?

High-pitched voice?  Her voice seemed relaxed and natural to me.  I didn't hear any flat/sharp notes or tightness in her voice.

The point is that if you suffer from low self confidence and doubt you should try emulating power to bring out confidence, which empowers a person to venture out and become the best they can be. I really like how she set up the topics with research, specifically how other animal species use non-verbal communication to demonstrate power.

One detail - the use of the terms ""power"" and ""dominance"" used in reference to humans can bring to mind dictators, domestic abuse, etc. ""Leadership"" or some other term could be more PC.

I see no reason to continue this debate here, since you seem insistent on not actually discussing the video here, as well as my replies, but instead insist on making stuff up on your own."
UgxxRsEvr90M5XI-jcp4AaABAg,sweetness583,1377700687280,Idk what you're talking about. Switching subjects? Generalize the entire globe? Ugh that's what you do when you say you're not going to give people the benefit of the doubt. Just go do some power poses lol.

UgzZhpqSlO8UL7bZOut4AaABAg,sweetness583,1377700689857,"No benefit of the doubt? Oh ok that's fair. You're not saying they're a loser, but there is a big chance that they are so you're just going to go ahead and assume they are. Well then you pretty much are saying that they are that way. And you're not just having a first impression. You're making up your mind on who they are, and then you'll view everything about them through that veil. Everybody has first impressions about other people, but people take it too far."

I'm not saying that if you look like a loser, you ARE a loser... but lets face it, there's a pretty big chance.

UgydrgoSD6HhwhaBndl4AaABAg,Philip Zeplin,1377700689932,"Personal integrity has nothing to do with this whatsoever. And I don't even really see any big problems caused by ""this communication"" as you call it.
And yes, I would say you are clearly losing out, considering that you've stooped to the point of calling me a ""pathetic individual"" and calling people that exhibit strong traits ""assholes"". To me, that shows a lot of spite.
You sound like a fat person that refuses to go on a diet, and instead insists that seats be made bigger on airplanes."

Ugw5-xIiMbozUH0WRPJ4AaABAg,ExcuseProof,1377700689955,"One of the most valuable lessons here, which I'm grateful I learned years ago, was that the mind doesn't just affect the body but also the body can affect the mind.  This is very empowering to know it only takes making a change in how one is carrying themselves to create an instant change in thinking and feeling."
UgyWIMfDZpelFU13ZNd4AaABAg,sweetness583,1377700689963,"I'm not saying you have to personally know someone, just give them the benefit of the doubt. If you're interested in somebody running a project by themselves then you should have some merit of theirs to base that off of. How is confidence going to determine that? Confidence doesn't equal skill.

Why do people care so much about other people's confidence? I don't care at all if another person is confident. People are just shallow and use a lack of confidence to put the blame on other people."
UgzYTgD403fLGW1OIl54AaABAg,Philip Zeplin,1377700689977,"Accomplishments, motives and values only say so much. It doesn't tell me how you'll function in a social situation, if you'll fit in well with colleagues or clients. If you have enough confidence to properly run projects by yourself, or how you function under stress. And even if they did, I'm afraid I don't have the time to conduct 1 hour interviews with every person I ever see."
Ugwt-l2jrdseU37dyi54AaABAg,Philip Zeplin,1377700689989,"Ah, so there we go. So basically, you're losing out to people who exhibit these traits, hence you demand that we all ignore them, instead of taking some minimal effort to do it yourself. Gotcha."
UgzH-FGsr8h4XPNzeBV4AaABAg,markmh835,1377700689996,"Best TED talk EVER!   Here, this Harvard professor gives away scientifically-proven advice that is easy, free, and could change the lives of millions.  Thank you so much, Dr. Amy Cuddy."
Ugw1aso6bWE38WvMixh4AaABAg,sweetness583,1377700692652,"I have a clear view of reality. The way someone looks doesn't say that much about a person unless they go out of their way to look really ridiculous or something. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover. You should judge people on what they've done; their accomplishments, or their motives and values. But instead people think ""That person doesn't look very confident, they MUST be a loser."" I'm sick of the narcissism our culture breeds nowadays. Nobody respects modesty anymore."
Ugw6HMWq3pC-UWAFTV54AaABAg,Philip Zeplin,1377700692655,"I sorta feel like you need to come to terms with reality. How you look, walk, and talk says a lot about your personality, about who you are. What else, exactly, do you want people to judge you on? What you don't say, how you don't look, how you don't walk? There is absolutely nothing wrong with judging people on these traits, it says a lot about you as a person. Whether someone is an ""asshole"" or not, has nothing to do with this point.
That said, that was not at all what she talked about."

The Wise King Solomon wrote: ""As a Man (person) think on his heart, so is he."" (Proverbs 23:7) - Our mind is battle field and we are pretty much fighting against our own mind, so I would say that it is not faking when you do it against your feelings or thoughts, BUT a wise exercise to win the battle within your mind.

We need education on how to focus on facts though, rather than a 'presense' in the presentation. It's what science strives for. The culture is less than optimal at it though. That's why I like the internet. Here, the word is back in the limelight, and the image culture runs parallel with the words. So there's a window for focus on facts."

The subconscious, uncontrollable parts of the mind play a big part in how we judge people. You can't teach someone to produce testosteron or to stop producing cortisol directly.

If you don't understand how you are being perceived by others, you won't understand what you need to do to demonstrate your real self. A job interview is a snapshot view of a person and it is critical to put on the best impression possible if you really want people to appreciate you.

Even Jesus Christ himself didn't go around putting people down with ""low power"" he will always sit down with sinners and went in a home of midget that robbed people.

So why should we do it instead of accepting who they are?

Whenever I feel afraid
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune
So no one will suspect 
I'm afraid. 

While shivering in my shoes 
I strike a careless pose 
And whistle a happy tune 
And no one ever knows 
I'm afraid.

I fear I fool myself as well!"""

Her ideas on posture and faking it until you become it however, is more for your internal self. No matter what the others think of you, no matter the amount of assholes in the world judging you, if you feel powerful, confident, and strength in your own opinions and personality their judgment won't be taken to heart."

The dominant postures come naturally with achievement and confidence, right? Moreover, Amy claims that these postures boost testosterone and reduce cortisol.

UgykWj1Wiu2keUcGZaV4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770778,"You're right. It's not good to be alone all the time. The comments I read criticized the fact that extroverts are valued more than introverts for no other reason than that they are extroverts. I also understood that people felt indignation at the thought of posing as an extrovert in order to be validated. It's style over substance, but I must admit that posing as an extrovert works. You have to admit that it's pathetic that people respond to many of the same nonverbal cues as animals do."
UgzhxHrd8cpWGhqMslF4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770788,Unbelievable.  People commented almost as much about her dry mouth as they did about the substance of the speech.
UgwNwIWPwaDmpVoBPTp4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770797,"You're right, but you can project more confidence with nonverbal cues and you can also fake competence with it in some cases."
Ugx0p6doPPAs0hHf-J94AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770805,You'd be surprised at how few dads teach this.
Ugy2MiWFi98L44gncDR4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770811,"Seriously, I have seen so many business people use these skills to get people to like them for the sole purpose of getting as much as they can out of them and getting away with bad behavior by acting like they're sorry afterward and that it was all unintended."
Ugyo1n2YjI4rniggGV14AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770821,"good point, but it's possible to be extroverted and knowledgeable. Leaders often make mistakes when it comes to making difficult decisions because they would rather quickly and confidently make a decision than admit that they don't know the answer. They don't want someone, who probably doesn't know the answer either, to subvert their dominance by jumping in with the purported answer when everyone is looking for leadership."
UgydeNEXDGm_hqGvpkZ4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770830,"You're illustrating his point.  You think that being introverted is bad.  His point is not that being extroverted is bad.  His point is that being extroverted is not and should not be a virtue onto itself.  Being extroverted is rewarding, but it shouldn't be any more rewarding than being introverted.  Being extroverted or acting ""dominant"" is not ""having a good personality."""
Ugyl8tF4WgXGvkGCKjB4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770838,"Visually, it was a draw.  Obama was putting his head down more because he was taking more notes than Romney. He wasn't cowering. I also felt that the so called ""dominant"" behavior Romney was displaying was weird and unnatural. He was smiling way too much for no reason. On the other hand, Romney sounded more energetic, was better organized, and more succinct. People were swayed more by that than anything else, apparently."
Ugy1iLQOcKMSA8p0fdt4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770850,"Some of the most so called likeable people are the worst because people rarely suspect that they are doing bad things, which is why Ponzi schemes can go on until the money runs out. Notice how she said that the more likeable doctor was less likely to get sued. How is it fair for a doctor to escape a malpractice suit merely because he or she was better at manipulating the patients into liking him/her? How about people choosing politicians literally based on appearances? We're irrational people."

Ugw_GQhdMC5T4afnP_h4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770872,"This was a great comment, and you're right: too much of success and attraction are based on superficiality. We all know people that are rewarded primarily for their social skills and fluff like nonverbal cues than their ability to produce quality work. You got negative votes because most of the audience here is not interested in changing the status quo. They want to learn to use tricks like nonverbal cues to game the system."

Ugx_0uRT5OKiADYo3Th4AaABAg,nonchalantd,1377700770888,"I think that the point he was trying to make was that there should be enough room for different personality types to find success and that we should not all be expected to conform to some archetype to get it.  Despite what some commenters believe, introverts can also be successful.  Lots of very successful businesses have been founded by introvert and extrovert duos."

Please listen carefully, and please do not spread ignorance and hate."
UgylUrzApYy-yqkij1d4AaABAg,igniparous,1377700773182,"I suggest you re-watch that clip.  She explains what she said quite clearly.  She did not call Obama a winner, by the way.  In fact, she suggests that Romney won, or at least that he feels that he did.  She explained their body language in terms of the animal kingdom - big animal vs. small animal.  This is not directly applicable to the way that the average person interprets body language in humans.  Please listen carefully next time, and never spread hate."
UgzQbEoLJ9oEQEWX9Hd4AaABAg,igniparous,1377700773192,"God, I really disliked her for over half of this talk, maybe something about her voice or the way I could hear her breaths.  By the end of this though, I was crying.  That is such a powerful story she told, about how she passed on the gift that had been given to her.  Maybe we should be more careful to not let first impressions rule us, but even more so, our interpretations of ourselves should be open to change as we grow.  Thank you."

Since you already have the knowledge and the skills to do the job hence calling it ""fake it"" is really throwing your worth down. If you haven't the skills and knowledge you'll be out the door before you can fake it.  So anyone listening right through this, faking is not the right worth: probably boosting your confidence the old fashioned way is more in tune with your goals.
