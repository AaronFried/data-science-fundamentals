UgwnSGw5f4tzmeGPEox4AaABAg,patri0tstar,1534527751883,"Ugh. That was painful. I’m not sure either candidate ever actually answered a single one of the questions asked. It was primarily a lot of self congratulatory behavior mixed about with attacks on their competitor. “Mr. Romney wants to...”, or “The President has...”. Shut up about your competitor. If you can’t fill in 2 minutes talking about your agendas and how you intend to implement then that just tells me how woefully unprepared you are for the job. You should be able to talk for hours at a minimum on some of these questions. Yet they have so little to say they fill in the rest of the time with disparagements and misleading statements about the other candidate. It’s depressing."

UgxnSakB9fvZLeLOSh54AaABAg,The Most Hated YOUTUBER,1508866958844,I remember way back then they were talking about the recession and they said yeah but the oil company one had a 90 billion dollar profit. In a recession you know that's not because its a recession they just charge the most they can until it started to become a problem with the majority
UgyUOnwGKHb_56SW2-l4AaABAg,The Most Hated YOUTUBER,1508866958856,It's really that the Gas companies wanted to raise the price to 4 something because they knew they could get it but when people started getting mad and upset and stop using gas so much then the federal government finally change the law to change and control how much there able to charge because remember the federal government is a part of gas prices as it charges 30 cent per gallon.
UgwSqi9h7fqiY2mLx-N4AaABAg,The Most Hated YOUTUBER,1508866958868,The only thing about Obama that really didn't ever make sense. Was the gas prices. How is the  national gas prices were 4.30 something and it was 1.80 something in the recession yet in both prices The oil companies were making 400% profit no oil company was hurting or going out of business if the recession came it was 4.30 and now the recession is gone and now the gas prices are in the 2 something range.

Uggoqpwtyn5N5HgCoAEC,Robert Cece,1503596560297,"People argue this is when America lost respect for politicians. I argue this is when major media lost respect for Americans. Media ratings as the sole criteria to choose who appears on stage increased ad rates from $10,000 for a 30 second spot to $200,000. Of all indicators of success in the invisible primaries, media exposure ranked higher than anything. Which is why Trump with lower polling than Rand Paul got an insane volume of coverage before he had any votes to justify it. Which is why the republican primaries were watched by more than twice as many people than democrat primaries. Which is why Trump is your president. The people didn't choose him. Journalists chose ratings and ad revenue over facts. This is noones fault but the media."

I don't care what anyone thinks Obama is much more better than Romney in terms of their own perspective of their presidency and how it will affect the american nation. However the American citizens must realize that a president is only someone who has their own version of the world they want. Same with groups such as governments and agencies such as the C.I.A. You all give them more power than what they really have. Each group has their own view as a collective of how the society in general should be and operate and they have succeeded but only because all of you have assisted them very greatly without knowing which is their biggest secret. The american society must come to an understanding that no group, or government can control, hide, and expect to get away with it for ever. The events such as the surveillance leakage is one concept or idea. Unfortunately it will take several revealings for the american nation to wake up and see that everything is not what it seems to be. The idea of the C.I.A torture files recently new and this is another example. The question is how long is the american nation specifically going to allow these groups the congress, the house, the president concepts to continue? How long will it take for the american nation to realize that the specific structure of the government that they have now (many groups who do not see eye to eye but yet still make rules and regulations for the rest of the population who truly did not agree to be ruled or governed by any of these groups at all and that. the American nation in general are their own governments for they have just as much say as anyone. The idea of voting is one concept. The idea is to truly discern who has yours as well as all of the american nation and the world in general best interest not one who is ONLY for himself, or his political party, or his financial gain. Perhaps one who can take the concept of low class, middle class, and high class and bring them to the concept of equal rather than labeling and devaluing others set it up to an equal so all in that sense can be high class."
