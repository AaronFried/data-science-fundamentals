UgxFC7vBE4uTMAEv8FN4AaABAg,SixSixSix,1530663725747,"I think I understand most of what he says with reference to dominance hierarchies (so much interesting stuff) -- and I guess he allows room for the many actual exceptions to such beliefs as ""people at the top of the hierarchy being more likely to breed"" ---  

I think due to the way things are structured this is clearly no longer the case for humans -- with reference to such things as the movie ""idiocracy"" : Every unfortunate unfit ""dumbass"" (just as a loose description, for lack of me bothering to think of a better word) who feels like it can breed, and breed a LOT, and they DO (probably a lot more than people who may be far more ""fit"" to breed, say, from a deep, un-opinionated biological standpoint).... although maybe such dumbasses are at the top of a subset-hierarchy of dumbasses, and do not pass reference to larger structures, and the larger structures do not refer downwards : 
So : the way many things in society are currently structured is a bit of an upside-down pyramid, and will remain such, until the job-lot comes tumbling down. 

It's easy to see a lot of upside-down pyramids developing in society. For example, the cancer of management. There are many organisations with many more management and administration staff than the skilled people who actually do the work the organisation is purportedly supposed to do -- and I note that many times in such organisations, competence is actually not the selector for climbing upward into such managerial and executive structures (see ""Dilbert"", and everything in reality which that cartoon reflects).
Competence is a selector to a distinct point .... and then no longer."

Uggo9dcFAJt3CHgCoAEC,jonathon silver,1504484529110,"Christ was not the perfect Western man - more like Nietzsche's perfect enemy. ""God is dead"", yes, but what killed him? Humans. How? Via Christianity: they sacrificed him (God on the cross) - in their quest for comfort. That is nihilism! Christianity was a nihlistic religion. It is directly responsible for the modern state of affairs as it empowered slave morality. Towards the end, the religious shell was cast off when no longer useful, and we are left with democracy, ""equality"", pettiness - the perpetuation of the nihilistic core."

UghZ_us4tjeGG3gCoAEC,Mart Krum,1504484529133,"good lecture but his criticism of the left as schematising power structures into just wanting power and those actually in power as being more diverse, is his value structure. Its quite a commendable one, but how would it apply to our current situation? If we were to accept it as valid for our current situation and there was actually a presence of such an extreme right, one that only sees human life in terms of power, he just pulled the wool over your eyes. He did so by supplanting the diverse right as the right, not qualifying the current activities of the right at all. Sound familiar? That kind of smoothing over has been working for 'democracy' for a while. And remember, real democracy is a great idea. trust no-one- fox mulder. ps the constant conflict of left and right is summarised well by Iain Mcgilchrist."

Your lecture about reality and the sacred helped me let go of the spite I felt for others, especially religious people. Obviously I was already transitioning away from that person to start with, or one lecture wouldn't have made the difference. You helped me widen my frame of reference to include the future. I have imbued my life with meaning and am less stressed. I'm thinking seriously about my future as well as contemplating where being complacent will lead.

UggSry08GESDOXgCoAEC,Hereinliesthetruth,1504484530519,Fascinating. It is refreshing to me to see someone marry Philosophy and Biology.

UgiqPW0p-F85vngCoAEC,William Koscielniak,1504484530534,"Some random thoughts on Nietzsche: The first chapter of Beyond Good and Evil might be the greatest single chapter ever written in the history of philosophy. However, I prefer The Gay Science as a starting point. It's much easier for beginners to read aphorisms, imo, than essays. Not to mention that the profundity of the aphorisms in The Gay Science is truly extraordinary. I would stay away from Nietzsche's later works (The Anti-Christ, Twilight of The Idols, and Ecco Homo) until a sufficient understanding of his middle works has been learned and internalized. I made the mistake of starting out with The-Antichrist during a time when I was a very angry, nihilistic person and thus merely read what I wanted into N (although that's very typical of alienated youth)."

But he sorta doesn't believe in free will, he says the will is made up of these sub personalities fighting it out with one another, and which ever one wins we then identify with as ""our will."" So when we ""will value"" is it not then something bigger then, at least, the conscious will doing it, or isn't Nietzsche sorta saying that?"
