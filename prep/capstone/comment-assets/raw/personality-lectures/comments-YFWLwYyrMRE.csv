Ugx_nsQssgDS30GsevR4AaABAg,Kent Nauman,1533342436060,"See the ""9 dolphines picture"" (https://goo.gl/images/qyBPPN) on the internet then compare it to the Oedipal-Electra complexes.  I was trained in pediatrics and have never found anyone who has counciled a 3-5-year-old child on their infantile castration fantasies.  Rather Freud has placed God in a SCHIZOPHRENIA-god-CASTRATION complex which is analogous to a grilled cheese sandwich which has been dropped onto the floor then stomped on.    God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))
     The schizophrenic spectrum of disorders is deliberate obfuscation in psychiatric theory. SCHIZOPHRENIA is a malicious synonym for METAPHYSICS, SUPERNATURAL, and THE SPIRIT WORLD. This is directly analogous to the N-word being a malicious synonym for Blacks, Negros Afro-Americans.  ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù is organized schizophrenia, meaning the supernatural.   On the internet compare ""open vision"" with ""audiovisual hallucination"" to see quickly what I mean.
  I was certified as a back of the insane asylum psychotic by the Florida Board of Medicine which is the highest medical authority in Florida. Stanford University has YouTube videos by Professor of Neurobiology Robert Sapolsky who fills his classes full. His schizophrenia video says that the leading cause of homelessness is not drugs but schizophrenia. The most common symptom of schizophrenia is hearing a voice and the most common voice is Jesus Christ.  Other symptoms include talking to inanimate objects and/or dead people. The Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus fits Dr. Sapolsky's description perfectly.  Acts 9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:  Acts 9:4 And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  Acts 9:5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  Gresham College in London England has a YouTube video on personality disorders where the speaker sudden stops and says ""we cannot have all religious people on antipsychotic drugs."" Under DSM IIIr all religious beliefs were symptoms of schizophrenia however under DSM 5.1 some religious beliefs are allowed so just pew sitting is not enough to make a diagnosis of schizophrenia under DSM 5.1. God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))
     Warning psychiatric theory (PSYCHO the RAPIST) is fraudulent and injurious. Their optimal human being has been found. He is a psychopath who infiltrated the fertility clinics and had ~150 offspring.  When I was in medical school psychiatric class learning about schizophrenia having its onset between 18-25 years, I said what about Moses talking to a burning bush? The psychiatric resident was stunned speechless. When I had just turned 40 years old, the Florida board of medicine revoked my medical license for Axis I schizophrenia (chronic) with the symptoms including believing in the blood of Jesus Christ, smiling and believing in God's Word instead of DSM IIIr. Years later I was in my favorite coffee house when a man came up to me and said that he and his wife both majored in psychology so I said what about Moses talking to a burning bush? He said ""Moses? Oh Yes, a mega-schizophrenic!"" So I went to the public library looked up a book on psychoanalytic theory then looked in the index under God and religion where I found that both were treated as problems in castration. Therefore psychiatric theory has God in a sandwich which I call the SCHIZOPHRENIA-god-CASTRATION COMPLEX.  Do an internet search on ""religion is organized schizophrenia"", ""DSM religion delusions"" and ‚Äúpsychotic religious delusions‚Äù to see that I am correctly diagnosed.  God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))

Ugykb9q7Vy3r7VWPQMp4AaABAg,Oscar Paez,1530664036110,"At 17:03, Freud did say that in the beginnings of his theory but he then realized that memories were not recorded like they happened. In a card from the 21 of September in the year 1897 (number 69) written to Wilhelm Fliess, Freud wrote a famous quote that in spanish goes like ""...mis hist√©ricas me mienten..."" I'll attempt to translate it as ""my histerics  lie to me."" That moment marked the change of Freud's ideas and renounced the idea of the role of trauma, seduction in the development of normal conditions and ""recorded memory"" and adopted  the idea that his patients (especially cases of histeria) had an exuberant production of fantasies like in day-dreaming. He started to notice that under the conditions of psychoanalytic treatment there was in invariable generation and manifestation of childhood fantasies that manifest in instances like in thoughts, dreams and behavior. Maybe Peterson based that claim on Freud's earlier works that focused on catharsis and dealt with trauma. Hope people find this useful.

I am probably wrong but here's how I see it so far:

Our sub-personalities are in a hierarchy. Our ego is the king. Our sub-personalities are like citizens within a country with our ego being the president. We can choose our president to be a tyrant, a push-over or a hero. A tyrant wouldn't learn and would be destroyed from within. A push-over would be taken over by his sub-personalities making him confused and weak. A hero would learn and grow in harmony with his self. Roughly speaking

I'd like to hear about other points of view. Anyone ?

Edit: We externalize what's within therefore governments and how they govern are a reflexion of the majority of its citizens and how they govern their own sub-personalities. That is why it is of great importance that we take responsibility over our Self."

I highly relate to the parenthesis Peterson makes regarding female contraception and the pill. I was on the pill from age 16 to 21, and it's not until I stopped taking the pill that I realized how much it diminished my libido, as I finally awakened to my sexuality. Now, aged 28 and not relying on the pill any longer, I deeply appreciate that I can feel the natural cycles my body goes through, knowing exactly when I'm fertile and when I'm about to have my period, the highs and lows, trusting my body to regulate itself (which it does very well, like clockwork). My long-term relationship with a very laid-back, sexually repressed man, also deteriorated quite fast after I dropped the pill. I truly believe that it was because I was more in touch with my body that I was able to know myself better and allow an encounter with the wonderful man that has since become my husband. We have a wonderful relationship and sexual life. I would not recommend the pill to anyone unless absolutely necessary."

UgiBX13mWdULkHgCoAEC,Malumultimus,1504484865461,"Freud was an anti-scientific political activist who believed in Jewish supremacy. He thought white people were aliens that he could never, ever relate to and that they could never think the way he did. He even thought this of his closest peers and students, if they weren't Jewish. He thought white people were barbarians who would've never accomplished anything had Semitic traditions and people not come to them. He considered his work to be, above anything else, a deconstruction of the West and the Church -- and he succeeded, for the worse. He thought sexual inhibitions were a form of madness and, unlike the idea of every son saving his father from the belly of the beast, he thought every son sought to murder their father. His clique of psychoanalysts were like a cult where no one could disagree with Freud or else be exiled from the group and slandered; he even took some of his peers' women from them as a way of dominating them. My favorite story about Freud is when a man made a deal to have his young daughter sleep with one of his acquaintances and the daughter vehemently refused, and when approaching Freud about the issue, he told the daughter she secretly did want to sleep with this strange man and was lying to herself. Freud is a Fraud and it irks me whenever anyone talks about him or psychoanalysts in general, because they all still revere him despite what a racist, creepy asshole he was. Yeah, we're definitely living in a world Freud helped create, and unfortunately we'll probably never be able to reverse it.

UgghbUfi2aD8xHgCoAEC,Indrog Gordni,1504484874436,"I¬¥m really liking this lectures so far but I think I have to disagree in how you are interpreting Freud¬¥s work. If I remember correctly it is in the conference number 23 that Freud admits that what his patients tell him in analysis, more often than not, it¬¥s not what really happened to them. It is at this point that fantasy takes a crucial role in his theory, because even if we can¬¥t have a photographic memory of what happened in our past we still can dissect this fantasies, after all this constructions are the ones that more or less structure the way in which we may find satisfaction for our libido.

Why is this step necessary? You say it's a clearer way of looking at things, but at what point does the fragmentation stop? Surely, the ""main Self"" has its own intentions, why don't we stop there? Contradictions in intention and mood doesn't mean that each intention is a result of a SEPERATE personality. It makes enough sense to me to say that these contradictions, doubts, self-ruining pathologies, are defence mechanisms in reaction against some highly intense or highly frequent interactions with the outside world. To me, there is no need to introduce an infinite regress of micropersonalities. Unless that was means metaphorically. I understand certain ways of looking at ourselves makes it easier to navigate and sort our minds."

How odd. You are saying the ear is gate, in some ways just as the eyes are portals too.  Both open up awareness to new dimensions that can be terrifying.

I like your presentation of Freud.  Freud was an atheist but, ironically, his understanding of dreams provides me evidence for God.  There is something greater, more creative than my conscious self at work in me.  This I take to be a spirit or God.  I have had dreams of ornate buildings, of architecture with such complexity and detail, that I could never consciously create.  I am humbled by the experience.  One of the characters in the Brother Karamazov describes the same kind of experience.  Again, this is evidence of God for me, but in an indirect way.  These dreams were horrific nightmares, maybe the work of Satan.  However, I figure if Satan exists, that is evidence that there is also a God.  

All the best!"

UggqRUzdTabK1ngCoAEC,BaneClandestine,1504484885425,"A little rant. I do pray you read, and offer any insight. 

I too had discarded Freud for the most part, until I rediscovered probably his most relevant theory pertaining to this modern age, and the behaviors that strangle European people, or rather. The people most harmed via the psychological scars of the Enlightenment.  Side note; that is essentially what Conservatism is, a defense mechanism, birthed from the Terror, no matter how valorous it may be, it is still poor one, not because it is wrong, it is desperately correct, but as  evidenced from its failure to truly conserve anything, as a younger sibling,  sharing the same genealogy of a ruinous ideology. You cannot reason with Terror. 

Right back to Freud. I am speaking of his theory on Thanatos: The Death Drive; or, to discard will to struggle, and preserve. 

Freud spoke of quiescence, that is. To return to that which was prior to the emergence of being; to end struggle. It is not only that the organism(s) is simply suicidal; but now seeks abrogation on its own terms, and will not only erect barriers to prevent 
the possibility of trauma, how to deal with it, but will also resist outside systems that would dissipate the drive to self end. 

In extreme cases of psycho-spiritual damage. The Death Drive & Pleasure Principle will work in tandem. In merrily assisting the organism to achieve its end goal of termination. Bluntly feel good actions are undertaken to assist in dissolution. In Europeans this has manifested in perverse ways, marked often by policy. Be it Political or ""Humanitarian"" or otherwise and this strange invention, this thing they call Progress. 

As ""Thanatos"", or The Death Drive is the inversion of Eros; The Life Drive. We see noted behaviours, particularly, the dissipation of the self. Which today is a uniquely European phenomenon, no other group does this in such a large number. In the discarding of ""self"" there is no longer need to search or maintain links, links to ancestry,  people, or even past practices, nor treasured instruments of bygone institutions. Once a people have been effectively hollowed out, Atomisation, anomie, quickly follow which reduces the costs what would widely be seen as disloyalty in coherent groups. Other pathologies arise, such as in group self-sterilisation, harmful or closed sexual practices, Sexual/Gender confusion, the complementarity is broken, and so on."

I'm a bit confused because it's self-contradicting and I know for a fact most of it is false, if I'm understanding it correctly. I can't help but think I don't understand the slide. It seems read off like nonsensical statements. 

1. It was a world shaped by man for woman. This is seen clearly in the fact that society protected and nurtured women at every corner. Men died in hard labor, men only had the right to work if they supported woman, men died in wars, etc. It's called chivalry. To this day men lack basic human rights that were given to females long ago.


2. What political rights would men have? The right to vote if they owned land and were married? It didn't do much for them in the long run, obviously. Given that males STILL lack rights they have never had which were granted to women. 

2.2 Women who smoked were hard to be found? This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say, even if you are just reading. Watch any old movie and you'll see nearly every woman smoking. All of the older women in my family were smokers. Many of them had short hair as well.

2.3 If universities admitted no female students in the 1900s then how were there any in the 1890s?

3. The authority was questioned all the time and had been for several hundred years at that point. There are dozens of historical occasions in which women rallied and railed against what men do. Many of these things ended with prohibition of alcohol or no-fault esq divorces."

UghClVRTwF3XFHgCoAEC,Annyonny,1504484898643,"Here's a poem I wrote for you, Based Professor P:

I.
Attention! I'm special; my identity isn't what it appears...
My pronouns are zed, zee, zey, zem, xim and xir.
Got that, bigots? Oh, by the way, did I mention I'm queer? 
Gender, that is; but also, I'm gay. Let's be clear:
I'm a cucked chick with a cut dick and a rugged blue beard.
What's that? Triggerers, ""ism""-ists and 'phobics? Oh dear...
...Oh well, I got Orwell; Bill C-16, LOL! Now say I'm not weird.
And literally kiss my fat-shamed, oppressed, victimized, of-colored rear. 
And pay homage to Mr. Steinberg, feminists' best ally who steered
Society toward this radically righteous route of redemptive reconstruction that veered
West, first, to smash the ceiling of glass, at last, then thrice cheered.
For the end of your fucking-a white-male cis-het rape-culture draws near...
II.
...Oh, hi there! It's me, ""Kermit"" B. ""Frog"" here.
Don't worry, boys and girls and interested others, there's no need to fear.
I've studied psychology for 30 plus years.
I've shed, out of passion and manliness, tears.
For such is my love of freedom and speech; it's not mere.
I'm the damn savior of my whole bloody race, my country and my American peers!
So take note, don't let my lecture fall on deaf ears:
To put a wrench in the cog of cultural Marxism's gears,
Don't just ignore the threat as it leers,
Attack it with language -- civilized discourse -- and stickerized jeers."
