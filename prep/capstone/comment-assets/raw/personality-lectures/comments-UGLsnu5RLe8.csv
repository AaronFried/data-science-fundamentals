UgzEhpNLk880FOcsxxp4AaABAg,greyztone,1533342051649,"58:44 Crafty little switch there from the question of life having objective meaning (assuming that's what he means from ""meaning in a cosmic sense"") to subjective meaning. It's not a dopey question to ask if science can find an objective meaning for life. Science could have literally found evidence for a god, or an afterlife, or whatever. Indeed, it still might! As for subjective meaning, well by definition that's down to the individual and doesn't have to have any basis in anything at all beyond that.

It's all well and good to say that nihilism has no utility to daily life but to call it stupid and primitive because of that just betrays an agenda. Looking for the facts of existence and looking for the most effective ways to live your life are two different things. One might just as well say that the latter is stupid and primitive because it is based on biological impulse over reason."

Ugyj0VuHO8_9ZU6JPdp4AaABAg,Paul Dalessandro,1528071651726,"At 51:09 I'm having a difficult time following his logic.  If I go out on a limb, I'm concluding that the blind person(s) are using other non-visual cues to determine left from right (air flow, vibrations, sound, etc), but that doesn't seem to be well implied by what he actually says in this clip.

If I had to take what he says at face value, I'd have to assume he's implying some type of innate ""knowing"", which I don't think he's implying, and hope very much that he's not implying.

I'd rather just assume he didn't complete his train of thought, and he meant to say that senses like touch and hearing are so adapted to your nervous system that they provide enough data to make an accurate instinctual determination.

If anyone has further insight on this, I'd be interested."

That animal was consciousness...  It's a frigging talkin ape!  What more could anyone want?

44:13 IMO Shamanic rituals ARE the origin of the story of the garden of Eden.  Ayahuasca looks like a snake climbing up the tree of life/knowledge.  When someone (probably a woman, maybe called Eve) figured out how to brew that ayahuasca with something with enough dimethyltryptamine THAT IT raised their level of consciousness.  It's not an allegorical story.  It's what friggin happened!  

THAT is why shamanism exists all over the world, because it actually IS what we are meant to be doing.  All modern religion is to hide that...

The ""eye"" everyone sees when they drink Ayahuasca is because we are evolved from animals which are very good as seeing snake/reptile eyes, because they were our ""gods"" back then and decided who lived, and who died."

It's a hypothesis that went through the meat-grinder of scientific method, it is tested to the highest degrees of sigma, it has predictions that we tested and found to be correct it explains other aspects of the fact that it wasn't designed for, and it is falsifiable.

I've never been much of a fan of fiction/story books and I don't like watching movies much either. I prefer non fiction.

This is worth listening to a few times, particularly if you're someone who's had issues with depression. 

One of the major features for me, and many others, is that feeling of being lost every time you get knocked back; you loose your long term perspective. It would be great to have a little boiled down sound-bite or ""mantra"", something that just summarises this section and reminds you that it's a transformative period. I think it would help a lot of people get through it quicker, and come out stronger.

This brings to mind the so-called ""rebellious phase"" of teenagers. Perhaps it is not anomalous, pathological, or otherwise deviant behaviour, but an evolutionary mechanism indicative of the development of independence from the family. It may be that it should therefore not be repressed or necessarily punished, but guided along healthy avenues. I don't really know anything about child-rearing or the psychology of families, but does this make any sense?"

One thing that bothers me, however, is that there doesn't seem to be a standard to choose ""mythological"" stories and interpretations of traditions. How do you make sure that you are not essentially picking and choosing metaphors that support the worldview you already have? For example, you seem to subscribe to the worldview that religious traditions are basically ""moral"". But isn't it also true that exactly these systems of faith motivated violent holy wars and raids by Muslims, Christians, and Jews? Atheists argue that it would take the pseudo-logic of religion to make a naturally friendly human being do horrible things.

I have read that the infant has more neurons or synapses, but they are not connected, they are however ready to be connected. A better analogy would be to compare the infant to the astronomically huge catalog of a major electronic distributor, and how a engineer picks and chooses a very small subset of the unconnected parts to make a product, thus connecting those parts. Overtime many parts in the catalog become unused, unsold, and are dropped from the catalog.  Those parts are called obsolete."
