I score 44th on it and 14th on Orderliness. But I am not so sure.... When I was at my previous job, there were time where I voluntarily would work on weekends to get more work done by the end of the week, I sometimes would work from 10am to 11pm if needed, once I worked 3 weeks non stop even sleeping on a room at the work department on the weekends so I could keep working, etc. But then, I started getting depressed, my work wasn't being validated by my boss and I quit. Now I am 6 months unemployed so far at my parents house... I spend my day either going to the gym, looking for jobs, wasting time on YouTube by watching JBP lectures, read science articles on a thing I just had an idea on, read about psychology, etc. Thing is I am a Biochemist, and I am wasting my time reading about other things so far from my field and watching YouTube videos, that makes me re-think myself and presume I am not industriousness actually... I also got 2 coding courses because I got a job on bioinformatics and I do them totally unscheduled when ever I feel like it. But then I actually got a call I didn't have the job anymore before I even got it :/
See the contrast? What do you guys think? I have no idea where to pose myself... Please leave your comments, I'll be always available to answer (unemployed now so yeah). Thank you  Buckoos! üôÇ"

Ugyj4YzB-XLlto8iQjd4AaABAg,Jack Black,1530664169893,I just woke up and got a hunch that disgust comes from sensitivity. Not sure if that's right or even important but I'm always hearing him say we don't know where disgust comes from. It probably starts at the senses. People who experience sensations more strongly will be more prone to disgust.
UgxbDDojsvGyPIbtWGB4AaABAg,Marta Dias,1530664169910,I'm on percentil 85 of conscientiousness and 80 for openess. I would say that conscientousness is highly related with guilt. Jordan Peterson points guilt as a factor to take into account and I feel it is true. I love all his lectures and classes. I love the way he organizes so much information absolutely precious. He is a genius of our times.

Ugz6htZTR5iM-EkcB594AaABAg,Claudio Trevisan,1530664169942,"As someone who scored 96 out of 100 on conscientiousness here has been my experience with what Jordan Peterson says. 

Guilt: Feeling guilty if I don't do something is dead on. It is very difficult for me to just relax and do nothing. I would have a very difficult time being a musician on tour as was his example. When I go on trips, I can handle a couple of days, but any more than four stresses me out. I feel like I am missing out on pursuing my goals. 

Depression: If I were fired from a job, I do not believe I would be depressed. I have never in my life been depressed. I don't think I could have it in me to be depressed as I rarely ever dwell on the past. I am much more concerned with the future and prone to anxiety. As a therapist mentioned to my mother, we have higher than normal levels of serotonin and low levels of dopamine (not sure if this is true at all). But that statement is interesting. It could explain why we don't ever feel depressed or the need to pursue satiating (which is correlated with serotonin) goals. Rather we focus on task and achievement oriented goals. Progress is what gives us little dopamine hits, which is why I think I am so conscientious. The guilt is the negative driver and the progress is the positive motivator. 

Disgust: I wouldn't call it disgust, I would call it irritability. I wouldn't feel disgusted to drink my own sterile spit from a glass. On the contrary, little things irritate me. Chewing really loudly or obnoxiously, leaving dishes out, putting your stuff all over the counter and living room ( I live with 3 roommates). I don't get disgusted but I get very pissed off. 

Order: I like things put in its place. I like to see the counters clear, it's calming. Although I like things to be clean and orderly, I care more about order than cleanliness. 

Born with it or developed?: Interesting... I think a little of both. My friends find it odd that I make my bed every morning. I thought that was a normal thing. As I grew up, my mother always had me make my bed first thing in the morning. I always had to do my homework before I could go out and play. I always had to do my chores first before I could go do anything else. And I also watched how my parents acted. Work first play later. And I wasn't always to the extreme I am now. I used to not have a morning routine, I used to not have a set schedule, I used to be much more open to spontaneous things and just relaxing. This was me freshman year. After getting in trouble with the police for an MIP, twice, it took my conscientiousness to a whole other level. Not all at once, but gradually. Bit by bit, I added more to my morning routine, more to my daily task list, more order, more work. Its like going to the gym, once you start, its hard to stop. You feel guilty if you stop. At the same token, I do believe I could ease off if I really wanted to. I just don't really want to. I do wish I could be more easy going, but I do really enjoy all the benefits I get from pursuing my goals.

Just my experience, could be all wrong."

Dr. Peterson, is it possible that you could measure industriousness as more of a measure of suppression of action than a certain action performed? Delayed gratification sounds hard to express as an explicit reaction, but maybe easier to see as a lack of reaction? How long can someone hang onto a $20 bill that you gave them with the instruction not to use it, sort of test?
 
I'm average industriousness and very high orderliness, but my husband is exceptionally high in industriousness and very high in orderliness and the way he talks about hard work, it's more of a will to push through than a motivation to do. Sort of reflected in Hitler's fascination with will as well."

This idea came to me because I scored low in industriousness and it made sense to me because I have such low stamina that it takes me a while to do something and once I do something it won't be long before I need a break.

I have went through times in my life where I was becoming more industrious and it was getting easier by the day. It only started getting easier after I abandoned my one-meal-a-day diet and began to eat food at certain times of the day out of necessity."

UgwoKAvyZ0QcPVWxPJh4AaABAg,Gail Spurlock,1525393795385,"What is very interesting about criticizing the Jews for only engaging in commerce, not production is that most of the European countries forbade Jewish people from owning property.  They could not engage in manufacturing because that entailed owning land, buildings, equipment, etc.

The Jewish people lived within the restrictions imposed and still managed to not only survive but flourish.  In Will Durant's ""Story of Civilization"", through out the middle ages and renaissance, there were several occasions where the Jewish banks loaned money to the European governments as they spent their nations into bankruptcy.  Then, after being bailed out by Jewish bankers, they banned Jewish people and deported them without ever repaying the loans.

This is the cycle mentioned in Hitler's speeches as though they were corrupt.  Their patience, being deported after being robbed, accepting the circumstances and doing their best in the new land is little short of miraculous and forgiving."

Ugxp7ppUkRdYR6Vw2jV4AaABAg,Jason Grappone,1509755411228,"I think there is value in this Ideas but have you ever thought about dislike of new people being related to the real threats posed by strangers to communities? I think the reason for an innate fear to people who may look different relates more to how a stranger to a new community in ancient times could normally be a scout for a greater threat on the horizon. 

as someone that lives in a mostly white state, I can go months without seeing anyone that doesn't have white skin. My internal reaction is that of fear, which I know to be something that is not a valid emotional response and I ignore it and not let it effect me. However when I went to a mostly black college, over time that initial response went away. Then as time went by it happened again later in life.

   I figured it was a response that come about due to threats that could come from any new and different visitor to a community. Those who didn't have it would of most likely been wiped out like the Dodo bird was. 

   In the psychology of the landscape. One thing to keep in mind is that people feel most comfortable along the edge of the forest. Because standing in a field could leave you vulnerable and most likely you would be wiped out. So when designing walking paths it is best to have trees along them otherwise people won't be inclined to use them and find alternate paths to get to where they want to go. 

I get the disease reference  but I don't think that is the cause for fear of differences in people. 

  and American  Conservaties don't have a problem with homosexuality.  Religious ones make think its a sin but when you live in America it shouldn't matter to you what other people think about your lifestyle. The marriage aspect is a little different because as a conservative I fail to see why Government is involved in marriage if not to incentivize it to promote another generation which doesn't happen in gay relationships therefore its a null point. 

 as a conservative I can safely say we like immigration!! its a great thing along with free trade and capitalism .
   however if we don't have laws or a mechanism in which to use to make sure people coming to a country at least embrace the values of that country like those spelled out in the constitution, then a civil war may likely arise as a difference in culture and beliefs can cause issues. 

   As for federalism of the idea of states rights. By breaking down to smaller section of the country, where what is good for one part could be bad for another and to give the people of that state more power over their government, Local governments are a net benefit to allowing each persons voice having more say then federal government. 

   I Think you miss understand conservatives in America and how and why we value the original system. The reason for that has less to do with wanting to stick to tradition and more to do with the value that each of the traditional systems have. Make them better thats great, but when better means removing freedoms that they allow for than No!! 


   I know you did an interview on the dailywire but Check out Ben Shapiro and his talk with Dave Rubin. He spells out conservatism and the reasons that support it and it is not so much a resistance to change as it is a resistance trying to make something that is already perfected better, when the cost of that is personal freedom."

Either due to incompetence or to create a barrier to invasion the area was endemic with typhus which is spread by fleas and rats. Despite the efforts of the military government of the occupied territories,  typhus was not only not eliminated from the occupied territories but it spread into Germany where typhus had been eradicated decades earlier.  Eventually Zyclon B was developed to kill off the rats and fleas that spread typhus. 

By the time Hitler was seeking power,  this disease was part of the common experience of German people who may have been preconditioned to be receptive to someone who would prey on their disgust/disease reaction."

I live in Silicon Valley, California and I see this phenomenon happen all the time, the spoiled natives grow up to become losers while the immigrants such as the Chinese and the Indians are buying (multi-)million dollar houses all the time; and it's because they crave it and can afford it via serfdom for the largest tech companies in the world. Where as the natives do not because they are spoiled americans who are rich with ignorant bliss.

And not afraid of disease so much as demographic replacement and pressures that will lead to so much outbreeding of the peculiar traits of ethnic groups that they become extinct. It's about continuation of a species/race that we believe is worth preserving, and not a fear of smallpox. Consider the rates of reproduction among the races, such as non-white Hispanic and white people, and blacks and white people. Modern Whites are reproducing at a significantly reduced pace while every other race is reproducing as fast as they can. Why is it a sin to want to preserve blondes, blue eyed people, Russians, the French, the Irish, the English, etc., as a species? Why is this unacceptable? No one is calling for Asians, Indians, Africans, or South American Indians to be demographically wiped from the Earth or made such a tiny minority they will inevitably be bred out of existence entirely. Why wouldn't we want, for example, the Irish to continue to exist indefinitely? Are white people so flawed; are we ""finished"" doing whatever the universe intended us to do? Is our amazing capacity to invent and our forms of art just a result of custom and not genetics, so that people with any combination of genetics will be able to take our place in continuing Western civilization?

People who are lower in conscientiousness I think tend to live more immediately, in the moment, and thus have a hard time grasping that their current situation is not permanent and have an inability to look towards the future to a situation where they don't feel anxious.

try asking an anorexic patient what kind of person they are and what they enjoy doing in their spare time, they'll have a fucking existential crisis. that's not the case for people who are simply concerned with their appearance.

more than a marginal number of guys are affected by it too, myself included (i was hospitalized for it on the brink of death at 17).

although i do know from my own experience that i didn't realize just how emaciated and sick i was. i actually believed for the longest time than i was getting ""fitter"" and ""leaner"", and that i was perfectly healthy and not even starving myself. i'm more inclined to think it was a deeply ingrained denial rather than an actual perceptual disorder though. body image was only a small facet of the obsession in my case, and to me it would make sense that an obsession as strong as anorexia could just completely deaden any rational thoughts (i.e. i'm too thin, my health is deteriorating critically, and i need to gain weight) in its path to kill you.

In other discussions Peterson reported that a strong indicator of political correctness is if the subject has a low ability to articulate themselves linguistically. Now he's made it clear that political correctness is specifically separate from liberalism, but political correctness is still technically a leftist viewpoint. An authoritarian left viewpoint, which Peterson says they don't have strong scales for yet.

I wonder whether having a ""disgust"" reflex is a bad thing in today's society. I had the exact experience Dr. Peterson described when a drunken homeless man asked me the time... I was disgusted and didn't answer, he called me an ""ignorant bastard"", which made me feel I was even more right to have ignored him, as it proved my initial assumption that he could be aggressive was right.

See, the thing is, we've got a pretty darn totalitarian disease-fighting strategy here in America.  Every disease is an excuse for more tyranny, and horrifying tyranny at that -- medical tyranny.  Forced chemotherapy, forced vaccinations, and more -- like the release of GMO mosquitoes to fight the mosquito that carries Zika, a virus that's blamed for the shrunken heads in Brazil that were most likely caused by the agro-chemicals at use in the region (I've read that the highest consumption of agricultural chemicals in the world right now is Brazil).  Brazil consumes massive amounts of Roundup.  Roundup causes microcephaly:
pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx1001749 
From the study:
""GBH [Glyphosate-based herbicides] produced similar effects in chicken embryos, showing a gradual loss of rhombomere domains, reduction of the optic vesicles, and microcephaly.""
But certainly we can smash the Zika virus anyway by forced vaccinations and gmo mosquito launches along with all sorts of other wonderful things we can do to... lead a life free from the iron boot of totalitarianism?  Do I have that right?  That will  bring no relief to the babies suffering not from a communicable disease but from man-made chemicals. Same thing with cancer here in the States.  It's difficult to argue longevity is the cause for cancer when our children suffer from the disease.  We're taught to blame ourselves for living longer and not replicating our DNA right.  ANYTHING AT ALL to take the blame off the man-made chemicals that are likely causing almost all of it.

Just some rectifications though: there are no proof zyklon B was used on humans in concentration camps, it was ordered for delousing units, therefore gas chambers are most probably a war propaganda first used by soviets, then recuperated by zionists who used it to justify the creation of Israel and their current theft of the lands of Palestinians. This doesn't mean jews weren't persecuted though, they indeed were racially discriminated against.

One other point is that the rise of the National-Socialists was also partly due to a perception that Bolsheviks (and the massacres they committed upon that Christian nation) were mostly jews. This is also mostly correct. This doesn't mean any of what they did was justified though, but it is quite interesting to see that even someone who position himself as a ""sayer of truth"" (implying that it is truth above all, even if it extremely politically non-correct) can't himself escape this war propaganda and rewriting of history favoring and removing the responsibility from Judaism and some jews."

Ugi3WfGlykXIIXgCoAEC,Debonaire Death,1504485063110,"45:10 Okay so this particular slide leads me to a conundrum regarding your theories, professor Peterson.

You suggest that more conscientious and intolerant people are more disgust-sensitive. You also discuss a correlation between conservative views and these same qualities.

However, while I understand that they are far more tolerant on an interpersonal level with in-group members, liberals seem at least equal with conservatives in their disgust at a broader resolution of society. ""Shame"" takes a prominent role in the leftist confrontation of dissent, and disgust seems to play more and more of a factor the more radical the particular ideological group becomes.

This reminds me of Arthur Deikman's work on cult behavior. What Deikman discovered is that as the homogeneity of ""group think"" is consolidated, individuals external to the group are devalued and treated with aversion. It's very easy to look at this immunologically: as the ideological diversity of the group wains, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to an ideological ""epidemic"" that could decimate the population, and instinctively insulates itself from dialogue with opposing views as a defense mechanism.

Political extremists exhibit these same qualities. My question for you is whether it is this ideological homogeneity that could trigger the paradoxical disgust response found in radicalized groups that are founded on principals of openness and tolerance. Perhaps you could make the argument that the openness and tolerance are simply false principals that serve as a facade for the fomenting of resentment, but it seems like the psychoimmunological dynamic has something important to do with all of this."

This a posting on the Third Space wall, University of Victoria. 

To be honest reading that makes me want to join the military to kill the authors of this crap and at the same time eliminate the rest of the liars, useless eaters that come in and take stuff. The very narrative that this is pushing is forcing, so called white people that have no capital to die, or move form their land their children made of developed. Whilst forcing them to give over their university teachings as these individuals attempt to be the perfect model student for the profs that are leftover. This has a dramatic affect and teach gin and creating hate. A normal person should get angry and seek to destroy the author of such outlandish not proof. The very document is crpa and has zero evidence, and puts the worlds woes and any defines at the oh well you fit into the violent male category, or you fit into female hate, when they were talking about or against feminism, suddenly you were ea malechovinist. 

Regrettably these people get thousands of dollasrsan d tax payer money to create hate. Unfortunately, My soul wants me to go into the military and kill people because of people like this, althgouh this is one instance. It has been thousands upon thousands of instances. I just want to mop the earth in fire and blood, until all these little shits are dead from north korea, Mao, states, Canada, Africa. Every single seed of rebellion and desent against truth. If you call for peace you come to deceive and destroy, in allah. Serious read the fucking Koran before defending it. Read the bible before defending it. This shit is stupid. Read buddha's history and not the stupid religion that was made out of it. Buddha is far more interesting person, that went into the mountains to get away form the lies, war, and greed. Basically by walking away told them to go into their own ruin, for it was in their hearts they were already destroyed. Now I ask what mercy am or do I have. The only option remaining for I to peacefully gain a civil skill to be paid and have a honest living and family is the military. The civil grounds is filled with these people and they constantly lie and stab you in the back and if you not' want them by you or here your a racist,. No I am not , There was black people here before. The whole hit nonsense is there a a plethora of 100% blonde haired, blue eyed natives, so this doesn't make any sense, that ...

He might say that people who are high in conscientiousness (which is as you frequently have pointed out tied to disgust) are the fall back strategy for the process unfolding. We can call that process an evolution if we like, or something else, but I like the generic abstraction above it, hence ""process unfolding"". 

While the rest of us omnivore monkeys are eating anything and everything to survive and move the evolutionary needle forward, often by ingesting mind-expanding drugs as TM proposes and I second,  some of us better develop an aversion to this process or we risk self-extermination. Being open, extroverted, and willing to try anything is a high-risk / high-reward strategy. 

So channeling my inner TM, I'd say that conscientious high disgust group are a fall back strategy for evolution. 

I have to admit that there's a bit of an uncomfortable hole in my proposal. It's the disgust that is the active ingredient in this process, and I'm not sure which way the causation goes. Does disgust produce conscientiousness, or does conscientiousness produce disgust? If disgust produced conscientiousness I'd feel a lot better about my Terence Mckenna theory.

in the ""spit in a sterile cup"" experiment the right disgust target would be the spit in the cup (even though it is an over reaction), while the wrong target is the scientist telling you to do something disgusting.
when you step in dog poop the right target is the shit itself so you clean it off the shoe, and not to trow the entire shoe in the trash. 
when the Jewish community in pre WW2 Germany is so much better off then the average German, the best target for disgust is the perceived lack of philanthropy and integration, as it seems clear that the rest of Germany could likely learn of there success. the wrong target is the entire Jewish community and to then send them all to the gas chambers.

accurately pointing to what is disgusting is perhaps one of the ways we must self reflect in our own actions to prevent the terrible events of the 20th century from happening again."

The great thinkers of this age will be made for the mold of that system will that system be capatalism on top and sosialism down below but what wing and how is it funded and‚Äã controlled. In my opinion a new central socialism doctrine has to be conscripted to make that even feasable. We know capitalism works but it does not play nice with sosialism and visa versa ( not the working bit ) A good place to start from is to find the value trates of the lower end of the bell curb on IQ and then build a system of reward for the practice. In other words what is the lower end better at then the middle. But then the dangers of a I'll composed system is also eugenics where the cost of sustainability gets to high and some clown stands up and offers the final solution to market conscious people who can do numbers.

To take this further, do we have a definition of ""authoritarian governance"" in the following discussion of parasites and authoritarianism? For example, would it not be fair to say that the best measurement of authoritarianism is the tax rate, at least economic authoritarianism? There are various forms of authoritarianism, usually divided into economic liberty and personal liberty infringements e.g. what you do in your bedroom or to your own body.

These are in no way scientific terms, so trying to include them in any study will lead to serious ambiguity. It reminds me of this definition of ""race"" where you actually are the race you identify with (race as social construct), but it is much worse in this case, because the term ""liberal"" has a very wide range of meaning from e.g. laissez-faire to socialist economics, just as a start. These are antithetical definitions, but still widely used!

The disgust drive can go really really bad, for example...

Anti-Semitism is exactly the same as delousing. Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology, it is a matter of cleanliness. In just this same way anti-Semitism for us has not been a question of ideology but a matter of cleanliness.
-Heinrich Himmler

The disgust drive can be perfect, for example...

Matthew 7:6 
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
 -Jesus Christ

One must remember disgust has it's place.  Obviously if it is connected to bigotry and injustice then this drive is destructive.  However the disgust drive helps us protect us against poison, instills survival in children,  and create just societies. 

Proverbs 29:27 
An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

We should be disgusted at a serial killer for example. Bernie Madoff causes us to shake our heads and flare our nostrils.  Timothy McVeigh makes our stomach turn when he calls innocent blood collateral damage. The killing season in Chicago that makes no difference between harden criminals and the elderly is another disgusting feeling when we think upon it.  The pedophile rings in the Catholic Church cause disgust in us.  We are right to house this dangerous feeling.  It must be used properly."

He said that after WWI, Germany was a very chaotic place because of prevalence of diseases, economic turmoil (hyperinflation, high unemployment, and lack of public provisions), and extremely weakened institutions (the government was dysfunctional for various reasons). This chaos caused by all the aforementioned factors led Germans to wanting order to rebalance Germany's equilibrium. 

It so happened that Hitler and the Nazis had the best marketing strategy because it manipulated the desire of ORDER that many Germans wanted for their country. They developed simple yet very effective documentaries, pamphlets, and literature that appealed very well with many Germans such that the Nazis were able to win the country over. 

He then explains how the Nazis continued to utilize order as the main motivation for their party and ultimately their country. Part of accomplishing order was to kill the Jews because the Jews were responsible for the 'disorder' of their nation. Hence, the obsession with comparing them to 'parasites' that need to be 'eradicated.'

She's seen a couple interviews where Peterson seemed to say that women have not been persecuted as much as is claimed. Now she is worried about what I must think of her because I like watching his lectures. I said I'd think about it, and she didn't understand why I couldn't just trust her distrust in Peterson. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to give an inch on this. Anyone have similar experience with a loved one not liking the professor?"

UggN-gXoEcnZD3gCoAEC,Sarah Egan,1504485128409,"I'm highly conscientious, and I think it's because I can't stay still long, and leaving something undone will bother me so much more than just doing the thing and getting it over with.  I've started projects that take years to complete, and I keep at it because it's unthinkable that I would stop.  It's almost, but not quite, like OCD for a check list.  I have a list going constantly, and I will check off all the things.  Rarely does something come off the list without me having checked the box first.  It bothers me on an aesthetic level, as well.  I leave things there to nag at me.  

I'm not OCD, in that things I deem as annoyances only to myself can stay undone or half-done.  For example, when teaching my kids about chores, my son would often wear the clean bowls on his head like a hat, and I could let that go, even though it's gross.  I can see the importance of him learning the skills verses something done perfectly right.  In my business, or outside commitments, I am the complete opposite.

Not only does it make finding the good and productive comments harder but it also gives a bad name to people who support Dr. Peterson. I can already see how the low level of these comments gives people who oppose Petersons views a chance to paint his supporters as childish, stupid and whatnot.

I think there definitely is a time and place for these things and I have personally had a good laugh at them too, but its getting out of proportion. It would benefit everyone if we could make these sections the intelligent and productive forums they were before.

UghotDyrFK7xoHgCoAEC,Damnation Forsaken,1504485136189,"i am not sure disaggrablness leads to prison, well may be to prison ,but not to anti social behaviour, or more to what i mean, criminal, ..... and this case prison population is not a good measure of antisocial behaviour..
firstly, the skew is because women are more agreeable than men, and they get far less prison sentence for roughly the same crime and get accused far less often.. that skews the comparison...
over that i think people who are agreeable in general get easier sentence (no where near the gender gap) but generally....

also, the crimes even though equally damaging but done by agreeable people specially women is in general concidered less severe
 (for example in domestic violence, the women do less physical harm, so people suddenly forget that is not physical damage in itself that constitutes the severity of crime (or else most athletes and their coaches will be criminals ) 
but the intent behind the act , that the person commiting the crime is not worthy of cooperation... also that is partly the reason why many crimes against children are neglected)

also that crimes pitted against  compassion are dealt much less severly like someone killing their spouse for anticipation of threat against children , or similar crimes out of misplaced fear (this is over an excuse to favour women)

from my personal experience also...i don't think that even most criminals are disagreeable, but trying to wear a mask of it...

however the ones doing most of the damage are by far more disagreeable....

 but that's a different story, not the same as if you rise is disagreeableness your are more likely to be antisocial , well also depends on how you define antisocial, but not criminal......

Moreover i think agreeable people are more morally compromised ,in the sense that they hold double standards more ........ violate the principal of 
'do onto others as you have others do onto you'
much more"
