UgxxA5auT7k1lmOPWbZ4AaABAg,Thomas Hazlewood,1533342099448,The children's play is the attempt to define the parameters in which they can operate in areas in which they have very limited context. 'Normal' play would be the use of observed behavior to define a role. 'Exceptional' play would be constructing role templates beyond observable behaviors.

UgxT-_Uw3E23zWTSTNl4AaABAg,Christopher Rivera,1525393299533,"Nietzsche: 394. The universal deception and cheating in the realm of so-called moral improvement.— We do not believe that a man will become another if he is not that other already; i.e., if he is not, as is often the case, a multiplicity of persons, at least the embryos of persons. In this case, one can bring a different role into the foreground and draw ""the former man"" back— The aspect is changed, not the essence— That someone ceases to perform certain actions is a mere fatum brutum[232] that permits the most various interpretations. It is not always the case that the habit of a certain act is broken, the ultimate reason for it removed. He who is a criminal through fate and facility unlearns nothing, but learns more and more: and a long abstinence even acts as a tonic to his talent— For society, to be sure, all that is of interest is precisely that someone no longer performs certain actions: to this end it removes him from those conditions in which he can perform certain actions; that is wiser, in any event, than to attempt the impossible, namely, to disrupt the fatality by which he is thus and thus. The church— and in this it has done nothing but succeed and inherit from the philosophy of antiquity—proceeding from a different standard and desiring to save a ""soul,"" the ""eternal destiny"" of a soul, first believes in the expiatory power of punishment and then in the obliterating power of forgiveness: both are deceptions of religious prejudice—punishment does not expiate, forgiveness does not extinguish, what is done is not undone. That someone forgets something is certainly not evidence that something has ceased to exist—■ A deed produces its consequences, within the man and outside the man, regardless of whether it is considered as punished, ""expiated."" ""forgiven"" and ""extinguished,"" regardless of whether the church has in the meantime promoted the doer to a saint. The church believes in things that do not exist, in ""souls;"" it believes in effects that do not exist, in divine effects; it believes in states that do not exist, in sin, in redemption, in the salvation of the soul: it stays everywhere on the surface, at signs, gestures, words to which it gives an arbitrary meaning. It possesses a thoroughly thought-out method of psychological counterfeiting."

Ugx8NLbkvwSYv-Km-Ex4AaABAg,JustPast12,1515025299580,"Watching his videos a couple few times and making notes really helps me understand what he's talking about. But also inderctly makes u think of something. For example when he says ""depends on what u mean when u say"". So if you say ""I want to be a better person"" and he would say ""depends on what u mean by better"". That then opens a rabbit hole. When u start defining things all the way down to core is when u really see the surface clearer. Make sense? No? Ok back to work"

UgiVA18gHOhYC3gCoAEC,Mikhail Volkov,1504484499630,"It was the theory of relativity that accounted for the anomaly in the speed of light. General relativity is a bigger box within which Newtonian physics resides at human and larger scales.

Quantum physics came later, and it is not really a bigger box within which Newtonian physics resides. It's more like a different box within which Newtonian physics can be generalized to very small scales.

But quantum physics is still at odds with general relativity as one cannot be used as a model for fully explaining phenomena in the other. Indeed, we still don't have a complete model of physics."

UgjxncvZTu4CP3gCoAEC,Reynald John,1504484499732,"It sounds like you're operating on a common misconception about Hume's statement; when he said that you cannot derive an ""ought"" from an ""is,"" he literally meant ""derive"" in the sense that in formal logic derivations, which use letters in place of statements in the way that calculus uses letters in place of numbers and relies on various mathematics-esque transformations resembling functions and rules almost like order of operations in math logic. It is absolutely true that there are no operations that you can perform on descriptive premises in formal logic to derive a proscriptive conclusion. People tend to use this in the vernacular to say that descriptions can't translate to ethics, which isn't really true as real-life moral decisions tend to be constraint-satisfaction operations rather than derivations: we tend to start with declarative constraints that connect in such a way that ""ought"" statements are auggested (and often we come up with more than one option). Patricia Churchland has a more detailed explanation in her book ""Braintrust"" (an excellent read, by the way)."

UghWurLVE8A4pXgCoAEC,Michael Connell,1504484499769,"Rather than matters of degree, I always thought of Piaget's notion of assimilation as more akin to updating the sensory networks to map new stimuli onto existing knowledge structures (assimilating the world to the person as they are), whereas accommodation is more like a process of generating new knowledge structures (category systems, motor plans, and so on) to deal with a conceptual or task domain for which the person doesn't already have sufficient structures to map onto readily (accommodating the person to the world as it is)."

UggXDMD05kjyM3gCoAEC,LeeFerikson,1504484505260,"Great lecture Dr Peterson, but you made a small error when explaining physics around 23:00. You referred to the theories that superseded newtonian mechanics, due to the problem involving the speed light as quantum mechanics. In fact, it is special relativity that explains this phenomena, and uproots newtonian mechanics. Quantum physics, while also outside the realm of newtonian is something very different from special relativity, and is not used to explain the problem of the unchanging maximum speed of light."
