UgyJj6BcfLg-TksO6254AaABAg,Jacki Clark,1528071771329,"I would think, from knowing people that are clearly higher in industriousness would have gained that from the way in which they were raised. 
Obviously nurture weighs on our personalities. For example, I am extremely high in openness with an IQ in the 85th percentile, but I also am extremely high in orderliness (97). I grew up in serious dysfunction which involved neglect, abuse and having a mother with BPD. These variables have arranged my personality in a contradictory manner. I'm also very low in agreeableness, which is not common for women.  Due to being exposed to what I was as a child molded or, one might say distorted how I see the world. For example, I am acutely aware of people and their intentions (hence the disagreeableness) and I'm quite sensitive to cleanliness (the orderliness) but I'm super creative and my mind is ""on"" all of the time. My point is because I'm naturally creative/open it would be assumed I would not be orderly but I am. The high levels of disgust as well as being disagreeable come more from being in uncomfortable situations as a child than from my nature. 
Understanding myself and many (not all mind you) of the ""whys"" as well as knowing some industrious  people I would dive more into background and childhood for reasons of high vs low industriousness...it's a thought."
UgzmtL8ZpNhWmkUh1mN4AaABAg,Toni Duval,1528071771351,"I really don’t know what I’m talking about, but I really enjoyed wrestling with these ideas! :D

Prof. Peterson said at 56 minutes; “You can have a pretty vicious personality disorder that’s characterized by extremely disorganized behaviour and a complete inability to put long term plans into operation and still have a high IQ. One of the things we really can’t figure out is [why] the relationship between IQ and Industriousness is zero. Most of the brain models are predicated on the idea that your ability to engage in long term planning is a factor that’s associated with intelligence. Industrious people seem to not only engage in long term planning but they seem to do it right; if they are more industrious they put their plans into operation then the plans actually work. But it’s not correlated with IQ.” 

I think IQ tests designate the range of how complex or simplistic your (long/short term) plans are, but IQ tests do not factor in necessary value systems that determine whether or not a complex/simplistic plan will be feasible. In other words, no matter how well thought out a plan is, it doesn’t guarantee the plan will work. I think people with high IQs are aware that failure is definitely a possibility (especially with more complex plans such as the long term variety) and when failure is thought to be more likely than success, it leads to the pre-mature abandonment of their plan. 

Industrious people seem more fixated on the “implementation of plans” rather than controlling the outcome of said plans. The goal is to 'work hard at implementing the plan', and a high or low IQ does not stop an industrious person from working hard. I think you may have more success in measuring industriousness if you had your test subject carry out a plan rather than process one (for example, offer your test subjects a blank page with the instructions of hiding 14 ""N"" letters among a string of ""M"" letters, and whoever had the longest string of letters is likely to be more industrious than the rest). If being Industrious means that you are more willing to work hard, then it follows that your tenacity allows any of your small accomplishments to become bigger ones (as per the Matthew Principle). Therefore, Industrious people are more likely to be successful in the long term, regardless of their IQ. 

That’s what I came up with, but like I said, I know nothing :D"
UgxkkRPjF4P1pfUeAUp4AaABAg,Patrick Alaggio,1525393371363,"~55 minutes into this discussion there seems to be a significant gap in our wisdom as to why high IQ and a lack of sensitivity to disorderliness (disgust sensitivity) exists. The question that seems too difficult to figure out is ""why is the relationship between IQ and industriousness zero?!""  Could it be as simple as motivational influences upon a developing child? If a bright child ascertains that he can get everything he wants from his parents with proper behavioral responses then why struggle being industrious? Why bother when being polite and obedient takes up much less time and energy, which is then freed to pursue whatever activities are more pleasing and rewarding. Furthermore, if a person is exceptionally bright and those around him seem dull then why bother to compete? It's like a world class athlete being put up against a group of children. Where's the motivation in that? Disorderliness seems simple enough to explain; why bother arranging things that will take me away from far more important thoughts and endeavors when they will just become messy over and over again FOREVER! I've got more important things to do. Finally, why compete to satisfy a social norm if I care not about climbing over people on this rat maze imposed life of ours. After all, I have all that is needed and all the time in the world to enjoy my OWN creativity and I care not a wit about what others think about me. I respect myself, my passions and that is enough... I have no one to please except myself. Isn't this answer enough Professor Peterson? Either I am misunderstanding your dilemma or you are simply testing the class... or cannot see the forest through the trees with all of the limbic vs. frontal cortex considerations. Perhaps if I was a very smart cave man I would recognize that I did not have to hunt and kill the saber tooth tiger and risk death when I can simply boil the bones from the carcass, drink the broth and eat the marrow."

Namely, I've read your and Deyoung's paper On Openness and Intelligence and the construct of G in terms of Crystalized and Fluid Intelligence was exchanged for what was argued as the better construct of g as a bifurcation into verbal and Non-verbal intelligence that produced interesting results in terms of verbal intelligences correlation  to the Aspect of Openness, Neuroticism, and Compassion.

UgxOSrbkL6NWkkqM80B4AaABAg,garet claborn,1515025371472,"I have a theory on industriousness v intellect. Based mostly on my relationship with my younger sister. As a kid she tended to think I was more intelligent and I'd argue with her that she's got a different type of intelligence pretty often. - she is highly industrious whereas I'm rather difficult to motivate lol. If you can get me going I practically never quit but that's quite a tall order. ANYWAY

The more trivial the task was, I'd notice that I'd be bored very easily whereas my sister would see something she has a grasp of as opportunity to shine. She likes a challenge every bit as much as I do make no mistake but she liked to prove herself through effort. I see a feedback loop of challenge-->success stimulation-->continue, as the driving force behind all the smaller tasks that make up a 'macrotask'. 

It could be that for intelligent people they haven't had the exposure to things that are simultaneously familiar and challenging, requiring constant effort and a slow drip for success dopamine. If so, pathways would be less keen on noticing 'hey this is an opportunity to feel good about yourself!' but for some intelligent people it would vary greatly"
Ugzd9_nsplj9vPDc-p54AaABAg,J J,1509754971484,"The IQ discussion suffers from foggy definitions. There is mental hardware (memory buffer size, etc.), mental software (mental habits, thinking strategies, developed skills, avoidance of biases, epistemic hygiene, etc.), and actual software output (stuff you've learned). 

IQ is actually circularly defined as the ""smart""ness which makes you successful in life, which is why it is so well correlated with life success! What Peterson seems to be trying to measure (half the time, he shifts around on this) is really hardware. He correctly points out that better hardware makes better software and a bigger pile of facts (though it's simplistic to see knowledge as a bunch of facts; epistemic hygiene of factual info is far more important for many disciplines, especially the ""high IQ"" ones like physics theorist). 

They are using incidentals to basically look at hardware capacity. Your mental hardware specs. The huge missing piece is how interested you have been in created good mental software, good mental habits. How diligent you have been at that. Hardware does place a ceiling on that, *but not a floor*. It does correlate, but is by no means the same thing. Not even close. 

For example, avoiding logical fallacies is huge! And there is no guarantee that someone with excellent mental hardware will avoid many of the logical fallacies. Sure, some of them, like circular reasoning, are easier to see if your memory is better: you realize when you've just argued yourself in a circle because you recall where you started. But many are not of that nature. And many people just aren't that self-aware. They don't care about going meta on their thought process. 

The kind of fogginess here hits much harder on analysis of very smart people than very unsmart people, so it doesn't as much apply to the envelope-stuffing guy, but it's a real shame to have someone who is very smart, has excellent mental hygiene habits, etc. score only moderately well on an IQ test (like because they don't know the capital of Georgia - WTF? - or have a bad association with arithmetic for an unrelated reason so get nervous when calculating under pressure) and then conclude they aren't cut out for greatness in the intellectual realm.

Measure hardware and call it hardware capacity. Measure overall useful life ability and call that overall life ability (even divide it into fluid and crystalized; i.e., software and output), but don't conflate the two."
Ugx01JFprCT8-g-9y-V4AaABAg,Chuck T.,1509754971495,"Prof Peterson, you are working with several logical fallacies about industrious people. For example, you say it seems they can regulate their own behaviour to not procrastinate. Well this is near totally false. It's not a cognitive ability at all. Not only can they not regulate their behaviour, but this inbred trait borders on a disorder itself, but one that often tends to be an overall benefit  to the afflicted. They can't sit still or not be industrious. The skill and self control they lack is to slow down, analyze and collect enough info to act in a more informed manner. Normally someone smart enough will recognize the awesome asset of the industrious person and direct their massive efforts in a productive fashion, often in a mutually beneficial way."

In math tutoring we like to ensure people that are having difficulties that it's best not to think of talent as a factor in their success. Especially with math's stigma in american culture, it's easy for people to get discouraged. Nevertheless, it seems to me that talented - that is to say intelligent - people don't have to work as hard to do well in school. One then either decides to set harder goals, which would have to be external to school since you can't get better than an A, or one could become habitually lazy. So intelligence and industriousness can both result in success independently of each other, but I would expect that intelligent people that are not industrious all have some similar pathology so that they choose laziness."

UghKYWd1dEgEYHgCoAEC,Gwen Stoll,1504484576333,"Hello Dr. Peterson. To the problem of industriousness.  Taking a guess, I would hypothesize dependency on a couple of factors: a) the ease to translate intention into motor function. If you have to think about something a couple of times before the action it carries out, then it consumes a lot more willpower. b) the relative absence of mixed emotions. Singular emotions translate into small decisions that have to be made on the path more easily, whereas mixed emotions need to be processed on a higher cognitive level, which consumes more resources. c) high attention, particularly to detail. d) good resilience from single, failing steps. Both a) and b) make a person more prone to distractions.   Then industriousness and intelligence could contextually correlate dependent on how simplified one's internal model for the current situation is. If one has a very simplified model, the translation into action should be easier, and if the model is still complicated or yields ambiguous solutions, acting out plans should be easier.

Then, intelligence may counteract industriousness when the situational awareness is high (for example as measured by Richard Davidson), i.e. the sequence of encountered situations contains many new observations that intelligence wants to integrate into the model. Following a plan should be easier when those additional stimuli remain subceptions. But once the model is complete, the inhibiting effect should be less. 

Another influential factor may be self-awareness, i.e. insula activity. If self-awarenness remains high during tasks that are related to industriousness, emotional contextualization should be reduced and thus alter inhibition or drive."

One question I have about IQ and the problem you are facing in regards to being able to be industrious might more than likely have something to do with upbringing. I know some very intelligent people that were in foster care and in group homes but that kind of environment isn't conducive to an emotional state of well being that produces industrious people. In that, I mean that if you are exceptionally intelligent in a group home or foster home, ""who cares"". So, then the outlook of the person with said high IQ, doesn't care either. That to me is an extreme example but it happens a lot. I'm sure the ignorance of a child's talents and potential happens in a lot of homes with parents who are also intelligent that work long hours or with parents that are gone for long periods of time as well. 

I know of a guy who can understand physics easily and is currently writing a book on his version of unified theory but he lives on a ranch and isn't very successful but he isn't poor and he also never graduated from college and anyone that knows him, doesn't really like him because he is socially obtuse and hard to get along with. I think the problem with having a high IQ and being industrious is about the hundreds or possibly thousands (or maybe even more) of people with high IQ's that aren't recognized as such because the people they are around don't care to find out so the person that has that potential doesn't care either. I could be way off, I don't know. I'm just speaking from personal experience. At the age of 17 I was tested to have an IQ of 136 and no one cared, so I joined the military and made it a career.

Ugj0hP_COi9ITHgCoAEC,VH 78,1504484578293,"According to a quick Google search more than 30 Percent of all people have a college degree or higher. So even if you assume a strict relationship between Iq and level of education, it seems a bit bold to state that ""students (not even graduates!) of higher education have an Iq of 115 or above""..."
Ughc_7ePvZRY7XgCoAEC,DarthYuYevon,1504484578307,"Lastly, about the guy who seemed to not have the ability to do any job, Peterson left out a bunch of useful info, like for instance, could the guy drive a car? Could he put together a desk or some other furniture by himself? Could he write a clear email? Could he read information and understand it, like an magazine article, newspaper, or book? I ask because if he was really that dumb then you would be able to see the result of his stupidity in other areas of his life. You won't be able to drive a car if you can't even work the lowest of jobs. You won't be able to put together objects like furniture that you need to assemble. In fact what could this guy do at all? Without knowing this, it's hard to know what his IQ may have been. Could he even speak well enough for you to understand? He sounded like he was retarded, and clearly retarded people won't find jobs. Peterson mentioned we have a large unemployment problem. Do we really have a very high percent of retarded people in the U.S? That seems unlikely, and what would be the solution? It seems schools should be able to figure out IQ of children in grade school which should determine who is retarded and who isn't, and then come up with jobs that are only for retarded people, where they are watched and cared for by staff, and pay the staff well for their job of watching over them.
.
Lastly, for the dumb, it wouldn't be a problem to point out who is dumb and who isn't if society wasn't so hostile towards the intellectually inferior. It's always people saying out of anger, ""what are you dumb or something?!"" It seems kind of dumb to get mad at the dumb. Why not embrace the reality that some people are born dumb at no fault of anyone since you can't help how you're born, and parents can't help who the give birth to? If you collect all of the dumb before that become adults and monitor them in a place where they do the most simple jobs, and even a separate facility for those who are hostile, like a kind of jail for the dumb, you take care of the big issue of heavy violence in America by getting at those who are most likely to be violent enough to kill someone, before they do it.
.
Anyways, just my thoughts."
UgjSV9WM_gaquXgCoAEC,DarthYuYevon,1504484578320,"Sounds to me that IQ tests only test what you write on paper as your answers to questions, but it doesn't reveal what the level of the intelligence of your actual brain in your skull is. I say this because studies have shown that if you compare students IQ of same race, and class, but from a great school to crappy school, the students from the crappy school show to have lower IQ's than the students from the great school. The difference is environment of the schools, not the brains of the students. If the students from the crappy schools went to the great school with their much better teachers and updated materials and usually a lot more funding from rich folks in the area, they will do much better and therefore result and testing with a higher IQ. So to say you can determine the intelligence level of ones brain with school IQ test scores is irrational and unscientific. The best you can have is an idea of what the IQ level may possibly be and then ask what type of environment the kid has been in for his life to see what could have contributed to that, but it in no way proves for a fact that this or that child has a brain of great intelligence or not. I like Peterson, but people like him never seem to factor in how culture plays a huge role in why one may or may not score high in IQ.
.
 Testing the difference between a retarded person and a normal person is pretty easy, and you can physically see the differences in real life behavior. But a lot of people claim that you can also see a differences between borderline retarded and normal. You can have one person score a low IQ of 70 and appear to have a low functioning brain, yet in real life this person makes smart choices, and succeeds in very brainy careers, while the person who scores a normal IQ of 115 may have good career but is actually useless to the company because they get by only on appearing valid but doesn't do anything and then gets out performed by the supposed low IQ person. To me, there needs to be a way to match IQ numbers with real life action all the way up and down the list from below 70 to above normal IQ, and I have never seen this. I only hear assumptions that claim to be facts because of supposed accurate numbers. I number statistic can mean what ever you want it to mean, but what does it really mean.
.
If you can't accurately match the IQ numbers with the actions of the person in real life, it's a flawed way of knowing what someone's actual intelligence is. It's like the idea of if you have a country accent and you're poor, and a lot of people like this are poor, it must be because they have a low IQ and look at the low IQ test scores so it must be true, so they must be stupid. But there are several reasons outside of IQ possibilities that could have contributed to why they're poor, and why they score low with IQ.. Anyways, those are my thoughts. I'll add, if you score with low IQ's, look to see if that actually matches what you do in life. If you are a success in life in brainy careers, ask, how would a low IQ allow me to do this. If you score with a high IQ, think twice about your situation if the life your living doesn't match your IQ numbers. Are you really doing a good job in your career or is it because you were friends with the right people? Are you truly skilled or do you just get by with bullsh*t? Is that irritation you have the fact that you can see that a person you feel are low thinking, are actually out performing you and causing you depression? Maybe you need to rethink your IQ."

UgjJLlsuhwcZVngCoAEC,Mephisto,1504484578357,"Two questions about intelligence:

1.) What explains the phenomenon of a person with high crystallized intelligence and average fluid reasoning skills? If fluid reasoning is the ability to assimilate information and learn while crystallized reasoning is a measure of what is learned, how do educational psychologists and psychometricians understand large disparities in the two measures? I gather from your lecture and from other readings that fluid reasoning and crystallized reasoning tend to be correlated, so it is uncommon to see the kinds of disparity I'm talking about, but it's still a question I'm curious about.

2.) On a public policy level, what kinds of conclusions might one draw from the IQ testing vis a vis the organization of societies? What types of measures might be used to reduce disparities associated with what might aptly be called the ""natural inequality"" of personality and intelligence, particularly given the role these personal characteristics have on life outcomes?"

That's a great line to end a lecture on.
Is that what Jung meant by 'in stercore invenitur,' 'it is found in filth':
That truth is disgusting?

I can understand that orderly people wouldn't like disgusting truth.
I can imagine that they could be quite industrious in trying to scrub out the truth.
Conscientiousness seems like more of a repressive superego than anything that could be called 'intelligent' in the sense of exploring and incorporating novelty (learning).

UgjIW6tk53Xc3HgCoAEC,Abreviatur,1472948580442,"Does ""higher intelligence"" describe actually some added quality (like faster working of the biological structures), a more efficient structure (like use of better algorithms), a better ability to focus and shut out other mental noise, or the ability to manipulate ""abstract"" data as images? The last item was my impression after asking a number of gifted mathematicians and programmers about their mental experience when working on a problem. It seems that at least a fair number of highly intelligent people have a very stable imagination for abstracta which they can manipulate like ordinary folks play Tetris or some such. This also explains why some people love ""abstract"" problems. For them, there is nothing abstract at all!"
Ughb8zWOjOp9V3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948580453,"Dr. Peterson always gives thorough presentations of the subject matter.  But when it comes to psychology I am not very convinced about it's accurateness or usefulness.  I like to think of stuff that seems to defy or minimize it's accuracy and usefulness.  I'll give just two examples to be brief:
1) Regardless of one's intelligence, assuming one is not an imbecile, the outcome of one's life will vary greatly according to how much wisdom one has accessed or been fed.  
2) Exceptions are very interesting, and don't always disprove the rule, since the rules are for the masses.  So we might want to consider that a different set of pyschological axioms/theories are needed for the exceptions...but how would those be pieced together.  I like the example of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was born and raised dirt poor in a shack in Pakistan without piped water or electricity, lost his father at an early age, and attended K-10 in a shack of a schoolhouse.  How did he get from there, to university, to working for banks in England, amassing a fortune of a hundred million, then appointed finance minister of India, then served two terms as Prime Minister and flipped the economy from communism/socialism to capitalism/socialism, creating an unprecendented sudden increase in prosperity like nothing ever seen before.  And he's not a playboy, not an extrovert, not super energetic, aactually very soft-spoken, and he's a religious person, a Seikh.  He's not even a politician in the sense that he never sought political office.   He probably was intelligent but his other traits don't support his truly massive success."

Uggb9bwPqPCxOXgCoAEC,Geli,1472948580492,"Jordan, have you read Gogol's The Overcoat? The premise is a man who is extremely hard working but not at all bright, such that he is adept in his current situation, but any promotion or novelty at all are impossible for him to handle. Dostoevsky sited it as an important influence. It's quite short, and you may even find it funny in its own dark, Russian way."
UghtE_AGQy4urHgCoAEC,Geli,1472948580505,"Sure intellect exists. We have talked about it for thousands of years. But it's rarely been seen as monistic. It might have a male and a female aspect which are quite separate and even opposed. It might carry potential in leadership and value in every common situation, but also carry the potential for a whole set of vices of its own, which are antithetical to success. 

But Intelligence probably has little to do with knowledge of trivia or innate curiosity, which today's IQ tests seem suited to measure. I should know. Curiosity for menial trivia I have in spades, but actual intelligence I'm still not so sure about. Or as the prof said, modern psychology might be better at rooting out those who are given to think they're intelligent, than the droves of those whose intelligence has gone unrecognized and underdeveloped. Again I would know, I think pretty highly of myself."
