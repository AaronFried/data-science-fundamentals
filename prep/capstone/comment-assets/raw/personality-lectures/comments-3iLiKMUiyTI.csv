They just made up seemingly plausible explanations and then ""confirmed"" them when listening to patients. It is funny though, how Peterson on the one hand often seem to rely on emperical science as he often talks about correlations, but then apparently on the other hand just decides to trust whatever Jung (or other famous people making unfalisfiable statements) said in the past. What is the method, Mr Peterson? Is whatever you find intriguing always ""the truth""?"

UgzvWF-kAVkw7YVEkG54AaABAg,phat phuc,1534206417438,"The lion merely emphasizes and reinforces the divine right of kings.

Scar was blessed with intelligence, instead of ""brute force"" which is how religion selects its rulers for the people to worship. It was the monkey which took the throne from Scar and gave it to Mustafa. When the monkey split the fruit, holy sacrament, the corona which it created was religion acting as the authority of some divine being expressed in the monkey which gave hereditary monarchy the right to rule by anointment or by appointment. We see throughout history monarchs painted with some reference of heavenly inspiration in the form of a halo or the association with dragons in reference to the east. The perception of the church which is reflected in the monkey is somewhat relative to reality, the animals bowed to the monkey before they bowed to the lions looking down upon them, the monkey climbs up instead of walking up which is how the lions navigate this structure. The monkey hugged the lion, yet the bird bowed to the lion. The church would have you assume, their responsibility is one of being humble and duty bound, but in reality. It was the monkey which created the environment in which order is established, for the king who ruled by force to subjugate the masses and they automatically acts out because they were trained to assume it was divinely inspired, by the will of god. Who is more powerful, the one who wears the crown or the one who places the crown on the head which carry it. One of the more revered animals to the Egyptians, were bees like the ants. Who ruled by another means, pheromones as a result cities were born."

Thus the modern ""rational"" man attacks anyone who thinks in graphics and metaphorically, they deem them as superstitious. Hence the death of mythologies lamented by Nietzsche.

Professor Peterson, why dont you mention the grotesque depiction of the spotted hyena in this movie?  I mean no matter how good the symbolism and archetypes of this movie are, if its built on PROVEN wrong assumptions about things or creatues (like the hyena) then its really devaluing the message of it.

Hyenas are devoted mothers, have stable societys built on hierachy, competence and rituals and hunt 10 times more than they scavenge. No matter what size, a hyena clan would never attack an adult male lion. Everything depicted and said about hyenas is bullshit except that they can break bones with their teeth.

What makes it even more retarded is that pretty much half of all hyena deaths are related to lion attacks eventhough the lions dont even eat them, they just kill them for fun or to decrease hunting competition. Showing hyenas as sadistic and mindless murderers of lions is like the most ignorant and wrong thing Disney could do.

Lions have no function whatever in nature other than being apex predators. In all territories where they are extinct due to human hunting their disappearence doesnt make any difference for the eco system. Their gap is replaced fast by other competent predators (like the hyena) , lions have absolutely no utility that nature would miss.

For me it  pretty much shows how shallow human cultures and degenerate authors like Hemingway are in depicting animals for their narratives. They always put brute force and aesthetics over utility, thats why most people respect lions while dislike hyenas. Thats a more nazi thing for me than marching in goosestep.

Hyenas have some unique utilities that cannot be replaced by any other animal. They can digest bones, which exposes the calcium and bone mark hidden in the bones of animals. So instead letting bones untouched for millions of years hidden in the earth, the nutrients of bones get back to living organisms. Vultures and other birds feast on hyena shit so they get the calcium required for producing eggs robut enough for an unproblematic time for the baby birds in their eggs.

Hyenas also can eat every biological meat waste, no matter how rotten or infected of diseases it is, without getting sick from it thanks to their abnormal strong stomach acid. They transmit little to no diseases to humans or other animals which is also very rare for the complex mammal that they are. They literally prevent diseases instead of spreading them.

They also require extremly little watter compared to their size and weight, so they really dont drink away the scarce water from other animals and plants in the Savannah.

I am not a biologist but from the facts that I know from real biologists and hyena researchers I think everyone should love them and they deserve to be a symbol of social, intelligent and indispensable useful animals."

""We know that if you take yourself and you put yourself in a new environment, new genes turn on in your nervous system. They encode for new proteins. And so, you're full of biological potential that won't be realized unless you move yourself around in the world into different challenging circumstances, and that will turn on different circuits.

So, it's not merely that you're incorporating information from the outside world, in the constructivist sense; it's that by exposing yourself to different environments, you put different physiological demands on your ""self"" all the way down to the genetic level and that manifests new elements of you.

And so one of the things that happens to people -- and this is a very common cultural notion -- is that you should go on a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere central and that would say, like, the rock, Pride Rock in the Lion King.""

The fact that new experiences actually change your very genetic makeup deserves more than the mere cursory treatment that Dr. Peterson offers in this lecture. Does he talk about this subject in any of his other lectures? Which ones? If not, Dr. Peterson, would it be possible to hear more on this subject?

Ugxr7t6rBz-VKzEQxut4AaABAg,Markus Domanski,1520123265075,"While this is certainly an interesting lecture, I don't agree with the theory about liberals and conservatives. Liberals want change, conservatives are fine with the way how things are. Capitalism creates winners and losers. Losers want to be winners and winners want to stay winners. The basic motivation for change is social status. Most liberals have a low standing in society (aka poor) while liberals with a high status in society have usually been educated by liberal professors (aka theoreticians) at universities. Most conservatives come from the middle class. They are not driven by ambition to change their situation. They believe that society is the result of an evolutionary process and there is simply too much risk in changing what worked in the past. The thing about Trump is that he managed to activate voters who are currently losing and want the ""good old days"" back.

The issue about borders is based on a misunderstanding about the function of borders. States need controlled borders where the default is ""no trespassing"", like the door of your house needs a lock and like computers need a firewall. If you switch off the firewall of your computer you will find out why it was a mistake very soon. If you leave the door open, you may meet very friendly people, but usually you don't. Even if you meet mostly friendly people, one bad person is enough to kill you. That's why we lock our doors and it has nothing to do with psychology. It's just plain evolution. The guys who left their doors open, just got killed by intruders and didn't make it to our gene-pool. It's not liberal or something to leave doors open, it's plain stupid and it will lead to the same outcome.

Psychology can explain a lot about the human thought process, but every once in a while that thought process is simply flawed. We shouldn't accept these mistakes as a wonderful part of human personality. We should simply avoid them."

The more a psychologist‚Äîa born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner‚Äîturns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner ""desperateness"" of higher men, this eternal ""too late!"" in every sense‚Äîmay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction‚Äîof his ""going to ruin"" himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness‚Äîfrom what his ""business""‚Äîhas laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honor, admire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived‚Äîor he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt great sympathy, together with great contempt, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence‚Äîreverence for ""great men"" and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honors the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them .... And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the ""God"" was only a poor sacrificial animal! Success has always been the greatest liar‚Äîand the ""work"" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the ""work"" of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is reputed to have created it; the ""great men,"" as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars‚Äîthe people then call them idealists‚Äîoften struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour ""faith as it is"" out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:‚Äîwhat a torment these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman‚Äîwho is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers‚Äîthat they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do everything‚Äîthat's a belief particular to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is‚Äîhe finds that it rather destroys than saves!‚Äî It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that demanded love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send there those who did not want to love him‚Äîand that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is all love, all capacity for love‚Äîwho takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such knowledge about love‚Äîseeks death!‚Äî But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. ‚Äî"

UgzT-fvEDlD00znjQVx4AaABAg,Eqx716,1509755313498,"I experienced synchronicity yesterday. I was up very early for work (4am). I walked outside to my car and looked up at the October harvest moon which looked brilliant  due to the light fog which created a halo around it. After briefly admiring the moon, I got in my car and turned on the radio. Crazily enough, the song ""Black Hole Sun"" by Soungarden started playing. This event was part of a larger chain of synchronicity. Chris Cornell, for those of you who don't know, was the singer of that band and the writer of that song. He unfortunately ended his own life back in the spring. Since I heard him perform the theme for Casino Royale, he has my biggest idol for the last ten years as a musician. His last album (Higher Truth) helped me immensely in the final days of my battle with alcohol before I finally achieved sobriety. I admired Chris for not only his music, but also for how humble he was as a person. I obsessively learned his music on guitar and watch many interviews to try to know him as a person.  He also fought addiction. Unfortunately the demons he was self-medicating got the best of him. His death came a week after I had successfully finished my internship at a mental health partial hospitalization program for teenagers with behavioral issues. That internship experience cemented my drive and commitment to be a social worker in the mental health field. Chris's death was a result of mental illness. The news of his passing hit me not only on the level of my professional aspirations, but also in regard to my passion for his music and the fact that it was a factor in my recovery. So with all of that said, that synchronous moment of seeing the cosmic beauty of the moon aligning with sonic beauty of his song was enough to make me burst into tears. Place that moment into the context of the narrative I just described and you can understand a hint of the sheer wonder. Thank you Dr. Peterson for sharing your teachings. I have been watching your lectures as part of what could be called my extended informal education since I graduated this summer. You have defined for me many of the mysterious, beautiful, and terrifying phenomena we experience in life."

Now, with a little bit of knowledge shown to me by Dr Peterson, it's obvious how that song gave permission for lack of responsibility, unbridled rage, self destruction, and nihilism. Now of course, people will say that Love eventually triumphed in the end, though in a confusing none archetypal way, and that ""Love saves all"" was the lesson. However, considering how memorable Disney songs tend to be, I suspect most will remember Elsa's happy call to rage and nihilism first and remember ""Love saves all"" a distant second. Also no character in Frozened went through any sort of heroic rebirth journey (heck, even the harsh climb up the peak was parodied by some conveniently found stairs). Worst of all Elsa's rage was never really addressed. I believe the writers thought that Elsa accepting herself and learning to control her powers because of the love she felt for her sister could count as a rebirth. But that rebirth seemed unearned because of the lack of the heroic journey. There was no burning off of the wrong self to achieve the new self, in fact, Elsa reveled in her rage and freedom from responsibility and was presented the most beautifully on her descent into chaos. In fact, she never really ascended out of it. Instead of a heroic rebirth, she had a narcissistic nihilistic, ""perfect the way you are"" one. Thus, on the whole, the real message was less ""Love saves all"" or even ""Let it go"" to more like ""You're perfect the way you are, you don't need to take on responsibility, and God help those that piss you off."""

UgjORqy4HW2QW3gCoAEC,Richard Noll,1504485020956,"(This is a response to a comment on M Czerna's website which hosts a 2014 lecture on Jung)

Dear Vegan GCB:

""Podcasting it out"" with Jordan would be fun. Serious discussions of Jung's work between people with different perspectives are rare.  When I told my students in my ""Psychology of Spiritual Experience"" course about Jordan's comments about me and my work, they too urged me to ""podcast it out"" with him. A few days later one of my students presented me with some buttons to wear if such an event takes place. They each have one word on them that Jordan has used in various videos or in written comments in replies to questions put to him about my work: CROOKED, UNSCRUPULOUS, JEALOUS, RESENTFUL.  I think we can all just have a good laugh about this.

But Jordan needs to explain why it is so difficult for him to examine Jung's ideas of archetypes and the collective unconscious in the same critical manner in which he conducts his scientific work on personality traits. He does not do so for his students in his lectures, nor did he do so in his video reply to Sam Harris. Jung made public claims about these concepts and then presented evidence in favor of them, but as I tried to show in my work his evidence was tainted (indeed, at times consciously falsified) and he never convincingly ruled out the two strongest alternate explanations for these concepts:  the cultural transmission of symbols and myths (of which there is abundant evidence) and cryptomnesia (a phenomenon Jung wrote about), which would be a more reasonable explanation for the appearance of symbols and myths and Greek gods in patients' dreams and in psychotic delusions and hallucinations. In cognitive psychology today this is sometimes called ""source amnesia"": and idea pops into our heads or our dreams and we experience it as novel and surprising, but in fact we had been exposed to it earlier and had ""forgotten"" that we had done so. Unconscious plagiarism (like George Harrison's case with ""My Sweet Lord"") is an example of this."

The I Ching, the version whose translation was approved by C. G. Jung, the Wilhelm/ Baynes edition can also give an overall impression and also a specific answer. (See pages 725 and 730 for help.)  Dr. John Beebe M.D. of the San Francisco Jungian Institute gave a lecture at the institute on how to use the I-Ching, (that specific edition which he recommended, and which he learned how to use growing up in China), and a movie buff, he gave a program of Jungian interpretations of movies,  both of which I attended decades ago when I lived in San Francisco. He is an analyst, a writer, is on the faculty, a lecturer, a past president of the C. G. Jung Institute of San Francisco. ( See Youtube.) (See Wiki.)  Perhaps Dr. Jordan B. Peterson could invite him to Toronto to give a lecture if he is still strong and healthy enough, or perhaps he could give a live lecture over  the internet from San Francisco."

UgjPYqhL9gd5o3gCoAEC,Richard Noll,1504485046842,"Jordan's pairing of Jung with the Lion King has deeper (perhaps ""archetypal"" in Jordan's preferred vocabulary) resonances than he may realize.

On Christmas Day 1913, while deliberately engaging in mental imagery/inner sense cultivation experiments in his home library, Jung had a visionary experience in which he interpreted (in a private 1925 seminar) as both a ""deification"" and an ""initiation"" into ancient mysteries, specifically the Mithraic mysteries. In this experience he assumed the position of the crucified Christ, sweat blood, and at the moment of climax he head turned into that of a lion.  He became a lion-headed deity (like Aion). This episode is in the ""Mysterium"" section of The Red Book.

For those interested in an analysis and commentary on this life-changing experience in Jung's life, my 1992 article ""Jung the Leontocephalus"" can be found online here: 
https://www.academia.edu/15115530/Jung_the_Leontocephalus_1992_in_Paul_Bishop_ed._Jung_in_Contexts_1999_

As The Red Book indicates, Jung had more than one deification experiences. Another involved being hung upside down from a tree like Wotan in Norse mythology.  I mention this, and other anomalous experiences of Jung, in my short vignette case history at the beginning of my chapter on ""Psychosis"" in Greg Eghigian's forthcoming edited volume, The Routledge History of Madness and Mental Health. The manuscript is available online here:  https://www.academia.edu/13557839/Psychosis._In_Greg_Eghigian_ed._The_Routledge_History_of_Madness_and_Mental_Health._London_Routledge_forthcoming_April_2017_pages_331-349

For those who do not want to sign onto Academia.edu to gain access to these papers, I can send them to you directly via email if you contact me at richard.noll@desales.edu

For a fascinating survey of these sorts of experiences, I heartily recommend classicist M. David Litwa's 2013 book, Becoming Divine: And Introduction to Deification in Western Culture. Jung is not in it, but there is a vivid chapter on the magical procedures for the deification of the magician in the ""Mithraic Liturgy"" -- an ancient magical text that fascinated Jung and formed part of the evidence that convinced him of the reality of the archetypes and of the existence of a collective unconscious.

Of course, it's their right to express their opinions but the way they're coming forward is akin to the way Nazis rationalized their views on Jews...I would like to hear you opinion on these matters but most likely my request will be ignored...but I just wanted to voice my opinion while I can, before the likes of me will be wearing armbands with a crescent on them."

I suffer cluster headaches and I found college too difficult to manage but I still  enjoy learning new things.

UghU3H9E6O3v9HgCoAEC,OneBalance,1504485055696,"Allow me to muse for a bit--First off, fantastic lecture Jordan, you articulate yourself extraordinarily well. You are exactly where you need to be. 

I resonated soundly with your comments concerning Satan and Lucifer as a representations of hyper-rationality of maybe just cogitation in general. Isn't it interesting that it seems it is the one quality within us that can make us begin to feel that we are something 'other' than nature--such a ""Satanic' rebellion, is it not? Being as it is that religion, in large part, is really a struggle to explain the presence of 'evil' in the world, I've always wondered intensely about these two characters; are they the same? Different? 

I wonder if they might represent, quite appropriately, two different poles of 'evil' viewed as a whole which if allowed to dominate, are particularly insidious. Lucifer has that fiery quality about him, being a shining light, the morning star, particularly beautiful. This is akin to arrogance, hubris, and the like in relationship to thinking that is more closely associated with an emotional link. Emotional thought, per se, that in its tyranny and impulsiveness may lead one to 'see red' with fiery hell-fire violence. Satan on the other hand seems to be a pole associated with infinite caution as opposed to impulsivity. I notice how when we think of any particularly terrifying character, we are 'chilled to the bone' at his 'cold calculations'. It is in fact rationality divorced from the warmth of Lucifer. 

It seems to me that Satan and Lucifer, in all their mythology, exist in some (as you might say, Jordan) hyper reality within each and every one of us. These are elements which as far as I understand we cannot escape. We are verily forced to confront the faculties of thought and emotion, and strike some harmonious balance between unchecked impulsivity and passion and infinite caution and calculation. Then out of 'evil' per se, something good, some harmonious construction is formed. It makes me wonder about the 'rejection' of evil, and wonder if it is simply not just necessary. A difficult conclusion, but logical nonetheless."

UgjbeBlvjzFFangCoAEC,tyler swedan,1504485067270,"""Jung"" yeah right. There was hardly any talk of jungs theories in this video! I'm excited for when he is discussed more"
Ugiv-e1eYEH0Q3gCoAEC,Kon Berner,1504485067282,"""The state is a hierarchy with something at the top that occupies a space that has been illuminated and made safe by consciousness."" So, for example, the states in 1937 USSR, 1858 India, 1945 Germany, 1780 Argentina, 1966 China, and 1937 Japan, would be examples of this. Right? Perhaps better to say that this is what the state could be, but never has been. Or at least to the extent it has been done, it has also been polluted with injustice and domination e.g. the Egyptian pyramids were built by slaves, correct? Might have been sophisticated and well treated slaves in many cases, but slaves nonetheless. 

EDIT: You started covering my point above around 31:00 .... Point: 1) living constitution needed sort of point... not convincing. Point 2: Misallocation of resources due to laziness caused by statist monopoly where it goes beyond applying ""consciousness"" and tries central planning (which can't work)... agreed. This is why the dominance hierarchy has to be constantly questioned by humans, especially keeping it as limited as possible (to the useful rule of law function). The rule of law is essential, but the New Orleans levees were not any aspect of rule of law, but were part of inevitably broken central planning."
