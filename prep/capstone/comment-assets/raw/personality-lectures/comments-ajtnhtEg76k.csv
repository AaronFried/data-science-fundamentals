Can't imagine the discipline it takes to hand scribe that much wording on that kind of medium because if you make a mistake there's really no way to correct and skin is very expensive even more so three thousand years ago. I think they are still to this day hand copied on to sheep skin ""sacrificial element"" to it and most likely has to be done by kosher law with a rabbi overseeing and all the rest of the rules and regulations just to get the ""paper""."

UggGqusffXXDRHgCoAEC,SunlightDivisor,1504484472554,"Dr. Peterson, I very much appreciate your lectures and public speaking. I only discovered your videos recently but they're already affecting my life in drastic ways, so thank you. There is so much that is taught in schools at all levels which is completely upside-down, and after years of being in the academy and seeing no hope in most 'educators,' I'm glad to see there are still honest people working to generate true understanding among students.

I have been thinking about the content of your videos a lot. I find Piaget's assertion that ""You do not have ideas, ideas have you"" very intriguing, and I find it goes counter to one of the fundamentals of our society, which is that every person is a distinct entity with free will. We do not choose what ideas possess us; it is up to fortune to determine whether or not we hold the correct views. It reminds me very much of Schopenhauer's correction and reversal of Descartes' and Spinoza's thinking: ""With those other thinkers, he wills what he knows; with me he knows what he wills"" (from vol. 1 of The World as Will and Representation). It is truly terrifying to creep up, through slow philosophical inquiry, to the notion that we are not free as individuals. I wanted to turn back from this quest many times because I saw that it threatened to destroy my life. As you've implied if not outright said in other videos, taking away responsibility is basically a death sentence for the individual as it gives way to nihilism.

Yet I do see it as a paradox to take responsibility given the apparent lack of free will. I understand that it is necessary to have, but given our growing understanding of the fact that 'ideas possess us' and the determinism of brain function, doesn't it make responsibility a necessary lie?"

UghQToqAPK5xJ3gCoAEC,The First Lord,1504484472817,"Prof. Peterson, if I understood correctly, there is just one type of intelligence. And that type of intelligence is spread differently within genders and races. I recall there was research that showed  that black people on avarage have lesser IQ than white people. Considering You have said that IQ is partially determining your success in life, is it then possible, that lower IQ of blacks population to a certain degree influenced the fact that so much of black population lives in not so good conditions? Compared to environmental and historical causes, of course, does it have any real impact?
And another question I wanted to ask - I have not watched all Your lectures, so I apologise if it is answered later on - it has been theorised, that people with higher IQ more often go to STEM fields. What may be reason for it?

ego extension of my step  mothers sister and her nephew-- i feel  they r
 in my head 24/7  like  if  my head is a house  then they r the  home 
owner and i am  just  a  pathetic tenant i cant get them outta my  head 
even if i  was to choke  to death  -i like   to say  -when i was 9  
years old this very step  mothers   nephew he   tried to kill me by  
hitting   me on the head with  a hammer- i  suffered  a terrible 
concussion but   i survived this   attack   any  ways  although with 
sever   amnesia and cognitive problems    i   got    hospitalized for a 
year -- after the hospital stay  unfortunately  -i was  forced to  
continue living  with this guy in my  step mothers  household  --- 
amongst  their family members    this  nephew   as a result of  his     
attack on my life    he had   regained    high  statutes as a   very  
cool  mighty  ass kicker guy---  their  relatives would belittle me and 
 tell me  we got u  this time for real  did t we??they used to laugh at 
me  and at my father   -- they used to  call me their scared little shit
   rat  begging for my life which was  true i did not care what was 
expected  of me i just did not wanna die  -----this nephew   on a daily 
basis    made me understand  that he is  not done with me but    is 
putting my  murder only   on hold and that i  owe him  my every breath  
 he  demanded   absolute   obedient  and ass  kissing   on my behalf   
--the other time  he heavy duty  planed and  plotted my murder is when i
 was  19  year old    how ever  this time  again i  got lucky and   i 
survived his plan--  later i found out his  plan    had not gone through
   due    to  some  problems which had  worked in my favor  this is 
years ago   but  now   i  always i feel  no  sense of identity what so 
ever   i feel this guy   has   swallowed my  identity whole  --   like  
that  movie scanner 2 brother  fighting each  other with their thoughts 
and one of them over takes his   twin brothers  body  while his own body
 catches fire  -- i feel  this is  exactly what  has happened to me --

Ughru46CNRN_G3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948474742,"I must comment on the dichotomy presented between Conservatives and Liberals.   Asia is almost entirely conservative.   Lee Yuan Kew in only a few decades built up Singapore from nothing into a major economic player, and a stunningly beautiful place.  He is a conservative, but to perform his magic he worked very hard to build coalitions comprised of very different peoples....Chinese, Maylasian/Indonesian Muslims and Hindus while simultaneously reaching out to all the business and shipping communities of the world to convince them that Singapore is the place to be, at least on the way to some other place.  

Somewhat similarly, in India, Manmohan Singh, a conservative (he's a Seikh), engineered India's turn from socialism/communism to socialism/capitalism, which he could only do through coalition building.   As a result, about 300 million people have been lifted out of crushing poverty to middle class, and many formerly middle class people are now living quite comfortably.  

It is often said that Asia copies while the West innovates.  I think that is due to the retardation caused by colonialism.  Asia today does innovate, Japan leading the way since the 1960s, and we owe the miraculous invention of the white led  (which is technically blue) to Japan.

Meanwhile I have seen pics of tomato plants in India that outproduce those in the West by about 10 to 1....their all tomato and almost no plant!   I've yet to see these in the USA.   

Meanwhile, in the USA, the Longshoreman's Union has resisted implementation of robotic loading and unloading of containers.....as Ayn Rand pointed out in Atlas Shrugged, it is the Left, not the conservatives, that oppose innovation."
UghHXlxh-ubz_3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948474762,"I must comment:  It is too simplistic to say that people don't have political ideas, but ideas have them.  Typically people adopt political ideas that represent gain and advantage to they themselves and the subgroup in which they commune.  A great example of this egg before chicken situation are the communist revolutions in Russia and China.  In both cases the populations were about 90% impoverished and over-taxed, abused, and caught up in wars waged by overly egotistical warlords.  Those who supported the revolutions were those who expected gain if the revolution was successful.  Yes, they would parrot common revolutionary phrases, but they all knew that such parroting was an act of taking a stand for that which they saw as gain for themselves and their subgroup.  Of course at those times the subgroup was in the majority and the revolutions were successful. You can hardly blame the revolutionaries, though things did not turn out as rosy as they had hoped, but at least day to day existence was relieved of some burden and uncertainty as compared with the past.  

Those opposed to communist revolutions were of course acting to protect their priveledge But in that group, and commenting from the outside, were those who extrapolated that ""rule by the people"" would be corrupt at best, and disasterous at worse, which is how communism turned out.  In the case of those ""extrapolators"" we see persons whose politics was formed by an idea, based in history, regarding how things really are with humans.  

But in any case the ideas of expected gain or loss and frank assessment of human behavior are the source of the choice of political stances."

Ugip8vepTb8kQXgCoAEC,TheMostGodless SinfulBastard,1472948474824,"Prof. Jordan makes: the brain is an extremely complex thing and we don't understand it, I'd would add that there's a group of people specially neurologists and people who take brain scans and such who think they DO understand it, and they say things like ""We don't understand the brain BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW is this or that"" and then they go ahead and make some very far reaching comments or conclusions about it based on what little they say they DO know; and people take that to mean so many things which these experts say or their conclusions and never examine the FACT about it they said they knew, never decide if it is in fact true or not, their particular lingo and phraseology makes it sound deep and certain... I guess the point is the little they say they know they DON'T REALLY KNOW!!!  So people should be aware of this.
