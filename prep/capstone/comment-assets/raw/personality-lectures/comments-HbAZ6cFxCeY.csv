To say that not even one time ever a human got accicdently swallowed up by a whale seems ridiculous. There swimming around with there big mouths open trying to eat krill .
If a human was stuck in the esophagus of a whale could he breath the air from the whales airways?"
UgyJ5OBeqrku5eMQywl4AaABAg,Tactical Victorian,1535675177650,"Something I noticed:

A soon as he starts talking about ""malevolence"" and ""Auschwitz"" and all that stuff that relates to  ""totalitariansim"", his body language and tone of his voice change to something  more alpha, more protective, maybe even more hostile.

He really does think in ""images"" and ""graphics"".

Also;

Republic of Turkey with erdo*an would be a holy grail for him to study more about totalitarianism. A live example of his expertese.
I really would like to read about totalitarianism from Peterseon.

Ugy7vhfM5agnaJm-eqt4AaABAg,JCM,1535415977777,"Its like the Star Wars story: the Jedi died in Order 66 because they were too proud and naive and their core philosophy was destroying the evil inside and being this devine creature. That lead to them being extinct as they didnt realize that inside of them (chancellor palpatine) was the true enemy. Then the hero who is Luke Skywalker faces Vader, the pure evil in Episode V and loses as he too was too naive. He then completes his Jedi training in Episode VI where Yoda tells him he has to face Vader to become a true Jedi and a devine hero. In the final fight he then faces the evil inside himself as there is darkness in him, as a part of Vader also lives in Luke because he is his father. Through embracing the darkness within in their last lightsaber duel (he hacks Vader arm off) he is victorious and turns the evil inside (Vader) to the light again."

Ugzk1g5vP0d2IogWF094AaABAg,GuerillaUnderground,1533342380650,"I think I know why so many men are terrified of women- without the formal education system, the age barrier would become a natural obstacle to sexual proclivity without being an obstacle to social interaction. In this way, men would be able to normalise their interactions with females in a ‘play’ type situation. The stratification of children according to age in schools is not a natural social structure - and it is doing untold damage to the ‘snowflake’ generation."
UgzgRbAdUFEO8sGiROV4AaABAg,GuerillaUnderground,1533342380672,This is the only comment that JP should really pay attention to- we have two modes of social regulatory self-control; what we are feeling and what we are seeing reflected in the other person’s eyes- this goes back to the knowledge of good and evil and the corresponding self-awareness that JP has correctly identified. A lot depends on the relative value that we give the reflected image of ourselves in the other person’s eyes; this is probably the most profound thought I will ever have and I thank JP from the bottom of my heathen/Buddhist heart for the gift of his impeccable work ethic and relentless efforts to impart the information that he has discovered.
UgwuDh83Qp7kMRuzSFd4AaABAg,GuerillaUnderground,1533342380683,"We are at a crossroads of our social and technological evolution and democracy only works if we all take an interest and participate- politicians have made it as difficult as possible for the average person to understand how our system of government works, but if we see something that needs fixing then we have to use the bureaucratic system of public service to make sure it gets fixed."

Ugzxk5F87883sdg64UZ4AaABAg,Kent Nauman,1533342380730,"Evolution is false on an eighth-grade rational man level.  The evolutionary theory fits into the exact shape of a classic snow cone just replace the ice chips with new species and positive mutations which do not exist but should be commonplace.  At the point of the snow cone is the ""origins of life"" which after over fifty years they do not have a mechanism for a self-replicating protein.  The canning industry puts all the parts into a can billions of times a year and depends on neo-biogenesis not occurring.  Information science shows that DNA can only degrade.  Currently, we are in the sixth extinction crisis that of large animals such as the lion, cheetah, and giraffe.  Extinction crises are not predicted by the evolutionary theory but rather more and more new species.  Creation is an upside down snow cone which is devolving through entropy to the extinction of the biosphere just as we are seeing.  The computer modelers of biological systems cannot reproduce Darwinian Evolution using Darwin's parameters either.  This gives evolutionary psychology and especially psychiatric theory a false foundation. God bless you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))"

His family of origin also taught him that everyone else in the world shares their perspective, so he accepts it as reality without testing it. It isn’t until he finds a validating environment when he learns his supposed weakness is actually a tremendous strength, and that his strength is particularly strong, and that he is gifted even among the gifted."

Anti federalists argued that the bill of rights should not exist, not because they did not believe in the rights, but because they believed that the rights were self evident.

There's a lot of things that can get you feeling completely hopeless - especially in this day and age.

Now I know why I like this song so much. Apart from resolving violent urges every time I hear war drums.

There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves

Jormundgandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Rise to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor Hlôdyn's son
Protector of mankind
Rise to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Vingthor rides to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world

Bolts of lightning fills the air
As Mjölner does its work
The dreadful serpent roars in pain

Thor Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Rise to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor Hlôdyn's son
Protector of mankind
Rise to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by it's tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thundergod

Thor Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Rise to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits

Ugy7OJ4cdtWXBz4Y5Ax4AaABAg,Integral Stanley,1530663985100,"I have been loving taking this course and wanted to share my notes in case anyone was interested.  Jordan tells us that a central scientific question is “What is the universe made of?”. He expresses that a more meaningful question is “How should I best live my life?”  He explains that for thousands of years myths have existed and been accepted because they help us answer important questions like the second question above. He believes that myths continue to be very important for modern, postmodern, and integral persons. To support his belief he tells us that millions of people have waited in long lines to view myths expressed through movies such as Star Wars. On the other hand few people tend to wait in long lines to listen to a scientific talk. 
 One topic of myth is when a person looks back and is turned into stone. This is the story of people who do not move forward with their lives and instead get stuck on something that has happened to them in the past. 
 Another topic of myth is the Phoenix rising. This is a story of how people can overcome difficult circumstances and move forward to live beautiful lives.
 Another topic of myth is the hero’s journey. Many myths have been told of a person traveling to far off and adventurous lands to bring back great treasures for the benefit of their society. A job of education is to give students the hope that they can live meaningful and adventurous lives and contribute beautifully to their societies. He gives us the sobering data that fully one third of the students at the University of Toronto are so depressed that they qualify to be hospitalized. This is probably typical for most universities in the Western world. Education needs to realize and help with this situation.  Jordan believes the great antidote is the hope of living a meaningful and worthwhile life."

• Our society has metaphysical ideas

 -  Maybe our society will work better this way?

• Implicit morality

• You notice corruption in the world
 - Do you run away and not do anything to change the corruption?

• The Hero Myth

• Facing and overcoming the monster (e.g. Basilisk in Harry Potter)
 - Pragmatically it means facing our issues, weakness and faults
 - Important as we need to recognise it as a symbol for our savageness or danger
  ○ ""I need to be careful of the things I can do""
 - (slight tangent) reason children as scared of the dark could be a holdover from times when there were dangers in the dark
  ○ Especially snakes
 - Attractive quality irl to opposite sex (particularly to female)

• We learn the most when we make mistakes
 - Learning is almost proportional to how bad you screwed up
 - Changing habit is killing an established neuronal structure
  ○ Extremely difficult and painful (literally and figuratively) 

• Perception is determined by values 
 - e.g. limited scope means we focus on things that are important to use
 - ""attention has its own autonomy""
 - We do not see objects - we see tools or obstacles
  ○ Obstacles can stop your whole journey
 - Objects affect our emotions and utilisation of them
  ○ e.g. patients with prefrontal cortex impairment - when they see an open door they cannot stop themselves from walking through it

• Mythologies show us shared values
 - Tragic self-consciousness
  ○ Search for meaning
  ○ Being engaged in something worthwhile => makes me feel worthwhile
 - We live in a society
  ○ Status and Respect 
  ○ Benevolence and Malevolence in society

• Psychoanalysts believe in different 'parts of yourselves'
 - 'angry self' - almost foreign concept that is so horrifying
  ○ PTSD
 - 'normal self' - regulates emotion
 - Do the different hemisphere have different consciousness?

• Cultural identity can regulate emotions
 - Expectations about what you're supposed to act like
        - Help individual keep emotions in check - to a degree

• Serotonin
 - Tunes your nervous system, 
 - When you are at the top of a dominance hierarchy your serotonin levels rise which means that happy things make you happier 
  ○ sad things make you less sad
 - When your at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy hardly anything makes you happy + everything makes you nervous. 

• To manage anxiety - (recommend at least 3)
 - Need to eat properly
 - Regular schedule
 - Career - get you somewhere on the dominance hierarchy
 - Spouse 
 - Family - parents, children
 - Manage intake of drugs 

• Language - is not necessarily required for social interaction
 - Pre-verbal comprehension of the world
 - Meaning outside of language

• Sexual selection
 - Females are choosy, pick someone higher in dominance hierarchy
 - Preference for creative men
 - Dominance hierarchy can act as selective mechanism
 - Nature is what selects = probably why it's Mother nature

• Social cognitive filter
 - Children personify inanimate objects => helps understand your world
  ○ e.g. animations
 - Because they live in a social world

• Major intellectual battle
 - Traditional - suggests that we have a nature, more based in nature and history (?)
  ○ Cultures we set up must match our basic nature
 - Postmodernist - blank slate, any aspect of us can be changed
  ○ Social construction utopian - human beings are infinitely malleable, changes to society will lead to perfect society"

It was easier for me to overcome become my family is basically 100% sober with the exception of a small amount of alcohol on the holidays. Making new friends and cutting old friends off is the challenge because I had roughly the same group of them for around 8-9 years. It really does become a way of life, not just an addiction to a substance. That's why AA focuses on a ""spiritual awakening and psychic change"" because you need a new way of life. I do not like the AA program or NA program very much but they do have that part of it right 100%."

UgwIwHgiprF1f5MxxOJ4AaABAg,Rafael Ramos,1515025613043,"I think Peterson makes a fundamental mistake when he proceeds to say that ""you can't act without a morality"". Not all of our actions are based on morality or have moral implications. If we consider, for example, a perfectly moral community, in which all evil is taken away, there are still judgements to be made upon a wide variety of circumstances: facing the death of a loved one or the choice of an occupation are profound human problems which have nothing to do with morality."
UgyeLAPBZMZedK0b88F4AaABAg,Eric Hiatt,1515025613063,"The idea that there's ""only"" general intelligence doesn't make a lot of sense, even though the various multiple intelligence theories are perhaps off base. Do this thought experiment: Imagine the set of all possible environments and all possible brains (you can extend this to all possible brains in any organism, alien or otherwise). Expose these brains to all possible developmental contingencies (e.g. all possible educations). So one brain gets to develop in every way possible in all possible environments. And keep in mind that environments are dynamic, so it's an exposure to all possible environments over time. Also consider that a given brain is competing/cooperating will all other brains undergoing the same conditions. This is an absurdly large space, but it ""exists.""

A given mind is going to be more or less successful in a particular subset of these realities, and the success is going to be determined by biological differences, neurological differences, a vast array of cultural and environmental differences, etc. 

Consider that creativity, for example, is relatively rare. In some environments creativity will get you thrown in a labor camp, while in others it will get you awards. Do we say that a person is lacking general intelligence when they express their creativity and are jailed because they didn't adapt to that environment? There are clearly differences in brains and differences in environment. Where is the general intelligence here? And some survival strategies, like going along with a brutal dictatorship, are suicide to the species as a whole in the long run. Is the general intelligence the one that will sacrifice our future for its own survival while the artist might take a risk?

And we also have proof that humans are dumber than chimps given the tyrants that humans choose, organized crime gangs, etc. Our ""intelligence"" has been used to amplify and secure dominance traits that can be kept in better balance by ""less intelligent"" animals.

The United States has more than 1000 military bases worldwide and has a history of overthrowing socialist/communist countries and installing brutal dictators. This is to protect capitalism (curiously - a long-term suicidal economic strategy). This is tyrannical behavior Peterson claims we don't engage in as human beings. Then we tell the wrong story from the comfort of our violence-procured-resource shelters. Many tyrants are simply beyond reach - so the strategy works just fine. Countries like the United States have indeed created Hell on Earth - several places and throughout time. So have many other countries.

Tinkerbell is a good metaphor for capitalism - with modifications. You never get to live in harmony with your home - Earth. You never grow up. So you wed a ghost who will turn you into one.

Culture kills other cultures. It's just a higher-order evolutionary structure. It keeps you alive the same as a spear - which is a tool of an evolutionary arms race. Humans are innately xenophobic."

That changed my mind since it nearly killed me.  I started taking lithium and it saved my life. There is a serious difference between ""problems in living"" and mental illnesses like schizophrenia.

UggqZRqytqnKz3gCoAEC,Simon Reye,1504484848269,"I completely agree with what he says about personality and character but he's not being faithful to the story of Jonah. It's not a precursor to a St. George and the dragon story. The whale in Jonah is not the problem, it is the solution. The whale is salvation. Jonah was already going down into the depths of the sea destined to drown and die when the whale rescued him. If you let the Jonah story stand on it's own merits it is quite clearly a story of the mercy of God. Jonah knew God would change their hearts and minds if Jonah preached repentance to the people of Nineveh. He didn't like them and would rather have them remain destined to feel God's wrath rather than have them experience God's mercy."

Males from an evoluntionary prespective have been collectors of resources and we know that women and gold are limited resources. Gold being the best rescource to have to attract a mate and Females being the ones to mate with. This female has also an increased value because of being a virgin, she has no history of sleeping with others and therefore has a relative higher value when you sleep with to produce offspring. As you go on to say the dragon is a choas, the person need to vanquish to be rewarded with those limited resources"

UgjwHnff0hDvK3gCoAEC,Matt Varela,1504484848852,"02/03. Historical & Mythological Context

- about mythological universally known stories:
        - a. why it is comprehensible
        - b. why it is enjoyable 
        - c. what exactly are you doing

- cultures use music to organise themselves, to catalyse their identities 
- in archaic societies, rituals use music and dance as symbolic representations of a mode of being in the world (ex. animals, leader, family, nature, etc.)

- HOW SHOULD ONE CONDUCT ONESELF IN THE WORLD?

- axioms of faith …society is supported on philosophical foundations, metaphysical ideas, these are manifested in stories and myths 
        - the individual has transcendent worth, fundamental axiom from which the human rights in western civilisation is derived “we hold theses truths to be self evident”

- mythical underworld (unknown/chaos) …place where you go when things fall apart, when an axiom with which you conduct your life, disappears/gets destroyed/fails/etc. The worst case scenario you can find yourself in is when you are playing a causal role in the “falling apart” of the axiom, this is specially hard to define.

- road to health …from a psychoanalyst perspective is that if you are not doing well, which means that the combination of your presuppositions and your actions translated as habits are not matching with how the world is responding. Then finding whats wrong with your presuppositions/action patterns and so why are they not producing the desirable outcome is what might get you out of the underworld.
        - ej. maybe your are not moving forward because of fear, maybe that fear is grounded in terrible experiences from the past that you were never able to understand.
        - what are you avoiding? from fear? disgust? 

- we are nested inside a dream cause we can’t know everything, we have to take things as givens and those things are nested inside stories, we accept the stories as valid, and then outside the stories is the absolute unknown. 

- to punish the virtues …is a central archetypical story found in christianity, for example, in which Christ is punished in the worst possible way for the highest posible virtues, thats why its archetypical there is nothing more unfair than that, its a sort of limit.  

- Because life is so difficult you have to do something that is truly worthwhile, in order to justify it. You have a ethical duty to straighten things up.

- respect for yourself …you cannot have proper respect for yourself until you know you are a monster, because you won’t act carefully enough. The harm you do to people can come in many ways. Understand your shadow.

- Jung believed that inside the shadow was the anima. It relates to the preference of the women for dangerous but tamed males.

- learning …finding out something that you do wrong, something thats build into you like a character, presumption of your perception, or a deep habit, killing it, killing that part of your personality, suffering for it as you correct it, and become a new version of yourself. the phoenix.

- mental disorders …these are not illnesses that have specific limits on the mind and life of the subject, they are usually embedded through out all across the individual’s life’s, so you can’t actually “clinically” remove it sort to speak.

- categorization …one of the problems that come across clinical psychology or psychiatry as a science is that their categories are actually quite diverse, the problem is big because if the categories aren’t homogeneous then its very difficult to draw a conclusion about the members of the category.

- perception …your value system determines the direction of your perception…you live within a framework of perception thats determined by your values because you look at what you want, you aim at what you want and once you aim the world lays itself out to you, and thats how perception works.
        - your value system is configured by mostly unconscious forces that you have little control over and determines your attention and focus.
        - The Ecological Approach To Visual Perception (James J. Gibson) …when people took at the world they see value first and inferred object second.

- truth …there is not one way of defining truth thats appropriate, the definition of truth might be more like a tool, and as tool using creatures really what we are trying to do with our conceptions of truth is to work trough the world, successfully. The darwinian idea of truth is that our notions about the world have evolved trough a darwinian process and that its appropriate for us to regard as what is most real those things that reliably ensure the continuation of our lives and the probability of propagation.

- archetype/to be human is to participate in a certain pattern of being …that pattern is acted out socially, individually and is also part of your structure, even your perceptual structure as a living organism of your particular type.

- culture …set of value laden presuppositions that you orient yourself in the world that MATCH the set of value laden presuppositions that everyone in your culture has and acts out. Is that match that regulate your emotions, is not the belief system, is the match/cultural identity. 

- serotonin …it tunes your nervous system, when you are at the top of a dominance hierarchy your serotonin levels rise which means that happy things make you happier and sad things make you less sad, so if your at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy hardly anything makes you happy, and everything makes you nervous. 

- society …the societal structure, which is an elaborate dominance hierarchy, regulates your emotions because the match of your expectations and the behaviours of the people within that structure, and your position within that hierarchy regulates the ratio and intensity of your positive and negative emotions 

- falling into chaos …it is not just anxiety, when you fall into chaos, you fall into a state where nothing is certain, the way you construe the world isn’t certain and even the way the world is isn’t certain because you don’t know how to act or your actions aren’t working and so the world is presenting itself as something that is chaotic, is not just psychological, the chaos is a weird intermingling of the chaotic world (“real” chaos) and the chaotic self (psychological chaos), those two things con spiral  …the distinction between the psyche and the world is quite arbitrary.
        - ej. a person gets fired, this is devastating, this is falling into chaos, psychological speaking you are disrupted and realistically speaking the person is unemployed that makes the world far more incomprehensible and uncertain.
        - Thomas Szasz - The Myth Of Mental Illness …most people have problems in living, not psychological problems 

- dimensions to live well …operating reasonable well in at least half of these dimensions will psychologically thrive you, motivate you.
        - schedule
        - plan 
        - career
        - productive time 
        - regulate use of drugs
        - family

- language …there is a meaning network outside of language, and its what language is grounded in and that is this pre verbal comprehension of the world, its an embodied comprehension of the world. 

- environment/social cognitive architecture …your environment is not nature, is culture, is other people. Your fundamental architecture is social cognitive, you tend to view the world as if it is personified. This is specially because the world in which you emerged as a being was primarily social, what you needed to know is “who is the big primate? who is the little primate? who is related to who?”.
        - ej. if a big chimp bullies a little chimp he can tear him apart. but if the little chimp is associated with bigger chimps, the little chimp can bully the big chimp, big chimp won’t mess with him. This is because the nervous system of he big chimp doesn’t respond to the little chimp as just little, but a little chimp attached to some big monsters. 
        - The nervous system responds to the network around the chimp. This is a kind of platform that constitutes the evolutionary underpinnings of your psyche. This means we actually dont care too much about what our “world/nature” looks like, but the relationships between beings, the social cognitive architecture. 

- super ego …internalised representation of the judgemental father, society.

- you can’t use science as a guide of behaviour, you use instinct manifested in imagination and the evolved structure of your organic culture (dominance hierarchy/emotions/feelings) 

- universals … social world, natural world, the individual 
               culture, nature           , you
          the known, the unknown, you
           father, mother         , you"

I believe you will be aiding and helping a great deal of people across the world who do not have access to Psychology University courses like they may offer in Toronto or other highly developed areas.

How could abstractions and complex thought structures become apparent to an individual before he could articulate them to himself? You, an Carl Jung, have showed me the answer (I don't have to explain to you how). Consciousness, and a more and more nuanced and sophisticated picture of the world, developed over time as we distilled our language and myth structures into concrete truths. 

I am attending Cornell next year, and I would love to go up to Toronto and meet you. I believe we think in similar ways, and ask ourselves the same fundamental questions. On some level, we have even come to the same conclusions, though yours are much much more intelligent, and simply enlightening.

UgiqPrGbhOuzJHgCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504484926648,"Jesus of Nazareth takes particular aim at those who would make the contents of scripture out to be beneficial fables to communicate virtues.

Matthew 22:29-32 
The same day came to him the SADDUCEESS, WHICH SAY THERE IS NO RESURRECTION, and asked him,
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Jesus answered and said unto them, YE DO ERR, NOT KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES, NOR THE POWER OF GOD.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

Whether one believes that the Bible is literal or not is up to the reader to decide for himself.  However it is very clear that the Bible wants you to take it at face value.  It wants a flesh and blood comprehension.  The incarnate Word is warning those who would scoff at the power of God.  Is the potency of the Godhead simply a series of cryptic lessons about values?  The Christ presents the ""intellectual approach"" as ignorance, even a form of dread.  He warns about this type of person and this type of interpretation as a form of fleeing.


John 3:3-4
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

Nicodemus is playing a game.  He knows God is not telling him to reenter his mother's womb.  However instead of confronting an otherworldly reality, he would rather shrink back into an all to human frame of reference.  He would rather cling to a template of absurd materialism rather than embrace the sweeping take over of spiritual reality which is turns materialism on it's head.  Sell all your worldly possessions and follow God.  This is absurd to the carnal minded. Why would you give away your power?  I am not saying Jesus was not serious when he commanded the rich young ruler and his disciples to divest themselves of earth's wealth.  However the bigger focus was to leave earth behind for the new kingdom.   God is moving the center focus of your reality from the earth to heaven, from substance to spirit.  The earth is not real power, barely a real place,  that is why the devil rules over it.  That is why the is friendship with the world is enmity with God. 

 Romans 8:7 
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  

Carnality is not just sex, food, drink, and revelry.  Carnality is a mindset that says I have a way of seeing and connecting to the world and I will hold to it even if it gets disturbed by an outside influence.  I will explain it away.  If many people see something supernatural, what do we say of it?  Mass hallucination!  That does not exist.  Any clear thinking person knows that you can not share a hallucination.  You can share an ILLUSION with a common point of scrutiny (refraction of light particles) like a rainbow, but not a completely self generated hallucination.  Why do we make up obviously false explanations?  Easy, to keep our old paradigms, to keep our old wine bottles, and our old garments.  The new wine and the new cloth that threatens to rent and burst the old are figments of our imagination or witty literary devices helping us understand and appreciate the old.  Never replacements for the old.  Listen to Jesus lay into Nicodemus. 

John 3:12 
If I have told you EARTHLY THINGS, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of HEAVENLY THINGS?

Mythologizing the real exploits of God is a clever way of running from God and his kingdom.  The main point of the book of Jonah is that no one deserves mercy so there is no point in devising a standard by which to administer it, just give it. The second minor point (my point) of Jonah and the wale is to take God seriously.  Jonah did not run from God because he did not take him seriously.  He ran from God because HE DID and did not want Nineveh to take God seriously, WHICH THEY DID!  The power of God can only be realized when you take it seriously.  Why did the sailors throw Jonah overboard?  They took God seriously when the lot fell on Jonah.  They did not symbolically throw him overboard by verbally chastising him, they threw him overboard literally to quell a literal storm."

UgiZuxzrnSjeuXgCoAEC,fred321cba,1504484947595,"Grrrrrr, thought this was the next lecture in the series. Well, hurry up!!!!

What's that? You have to wait to give the actual lecture to the students? No, don't worry about them, just give the lecture in an empty room and record as planned. Besides, I once heard a professor at a university say that these days it's a waste of time for students to go to university... they should go to a trade school instead or something like that. If any of your students complain, just pass that advice onto them.

And Jordon, if you want to know what crazy professor gave such advice, just let me know and I will try to find the source... but I'm sure it is sound advice so don't worry about your students. They can always use YouTube."
