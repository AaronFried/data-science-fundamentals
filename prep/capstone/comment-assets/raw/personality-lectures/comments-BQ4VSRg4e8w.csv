In jail I had some time to think about my response.  At the end of this lecture he tends to be dogmatic.  ""it's over man, it will never happen because there is data on this'.  i don't like this Jordan, I like the humble Jordan who speaks about possibilities and probabilities.  ' The chance of it happening are slim but what do i know'.   anyway this is a good lecture as usual."

I've always been good with empathy and after having not really don't much since high school as I've never had much interest in all things that come along with ""going to college"" I really haven't mentally developed much since and I've become somewhat stagnant. But while I was listening to the psychological or philosophical reasonings/ explanations behind regular everyday activity or our regular thought process that are presented in this video it reignited my passion in me for these things that I haven't felt for almost 5 years. It's beautiful. I was intently listening to this entire lecture and constantly thinking to myself ""wow, I never thought of that,""

UgxKOraDE9RhiV6vDld4AaABAg,SixSixSix,1533342399087,"I disagree with that point from Hume that JP keeps quoting  -- ""you can't derive an ought from an is"". 

I think you can definitely derive an ought from an is, with decent reasoning : 
For example : ""I know this berry is poisonous . Therefore, if I want to avoid dying , I ought to not eat it"".

or ""I know this chimp is a cruel tyrant, but since he is much larger than me and could tear me into pieces, I ought to not engage him, until I am sure I have enough support from the other chimps.""

There is a logical jump or skipping point there -- ie. why would you want to avoid dying? What is the logic behind that? But that's just the limit of our understanding of logic -- and this is where some bare basic intuition in terms of being a living organism comes in. 
The biological survival program is pre-written. Why is it written that way ? Don't know -- that's just the program logic which has developed.

You don't need to know the deepest level of a programming logic in order to see that there are processes which will make a program work or break. 
You can know how to write code in the C# language, without having to know exactly the mechanics of where all the 1's and 0's are going , or even knowing assembly language -- and you can see that what appears on the surface represents definite processes which are interlinked beneath the software layer.

Cultural and scientific updates are like software updates. Sometimes it makes the software worse, but usually it frequently makes things better and more user-friendly.

I don't see where the supposed ""massive difficulty"" about basing a reasonable morality or basis for action is in this sort of thinking."

How important these characters according to you for a human being? Because i feel extremely the need of these characters in my nation.

Imagine if you recreated the Vitruvian man without ever having seen it or even knowing who Leonardo da Vinci was, and then you proudly show people what you've discovered, but then they scoff at you and declare you didn't create it because someone you never heard of did it long before you. You'd be pretty frustrated, because you accomplished something transcendentally profound, but no one recognizes your accomplishment.

The solace I take in knowing when I've created or discovered something that geniuses before me already exposed to the world is that I'm at least partially on their level. Sometimes happiness must come from within, and to hell with other people's lack of praise."

Everything is instant.  Technically speaking, their intelligence would cease to exist within the current landscape of possibility.  It's like they become ""omniscient""--they know everything all at once--which renders them impotent, despite being embodied.  ?  Maybe the ""blue tooth"" thing renders embodying robots a future failure, because IF you have blue tooth as part of the equation, then what exactly does the body entail?

I graduated from college in May, and am finding these YouTube videos (a medium about which I am, at best, ambivalent) as rewarding as an course I took there (intrinsically rewarding, that is; they are not helping me to attain a degree).

So, perhaps ""better"" in the sense of overall economy of human effort in trees felled. But an individual can fell a tree by fashioning a stone ax that requires no mining,   smelting, or collusion with others for its production. The tree can be brought down with tools collected from your surroundings with one's own effort. So, maybe the analogy is apt because you could observe and figure it all out yourself, but that will take a very long time and you wouldn't fell many trees over your lifetime.

Whether Peterson incorporates Vygotsky's theories intentionally or not, or whether perhaps Piaget's ideas aren't actually as  dissimilar as other developmental psychologists seem to believe, Peterson, with his deep knowledge of Piaget's works, might be able to synthesize the two's thought into a more accurate working model or representation and provide an improved diachronistic model of human cognitive, moral, and behavioral development."

Language falls short in describing the world and feelings; the unspoken horror of childhood trauma one of the reason for therapy as painting, movement, music, no words treatments. All the emphasis later on putting it into writing will construe rational and FALSE explanation for what is buried and suppressed because at the time of happening of that trauma the words were not there. The feelings of rage or freeze-helplessness are buried with no word labels- just image, sounds, and smell. The resent neurochemistry demonstrated that it is even worse. Such experiences locked into R hemisphere of the brain (not just limbic ‚Äì this word should be eliminated, because in human it is FUSED through the neuro-circuits with the frontal cortex) and run their own bizarre circle of rage without conscious approval.  The pause (count to ten and breath) does not work for irrational- every time the trigger is pushed the survival kicks in, although the true issue of survival does not apply anymore. The problem is that the people who do not have buried trauma ‚Äìmajority, thankfully, do not understand it, and pitch meditation and mindfulness, journaling as cure for all. It happens as well in adult victim of PTSD; but in case of an adult it has labels ‚Äì words; which makes it possible for blah-blah therapy."

I know you are not a friend of Marxs, neither am I - so maybe you don't mention him because he fell in love with the marxist idea for some part of his intellectual career but became disillusioned by it and abandoned it. he never went on the nazi train and his book ""the mass psychology of fascism"" was one radical and powerful book during the time of it's publication (around 1930 I think) I mean I think it is still a very powerful and radical book... so why not give the man some little credit?"

I saw the lecture with the William James quote a few days ago and knew that he described something that I thought of a lot when I was young. My old diaries are full of attempts to describe that. Then, yesterday evening, I wrote that this thing he calls pure experience is lack of interpretation from a limiting paradigm. We have to use a paradigm to interpret the world and we are unable to create a paradigm that is complex enough to represent reality correctly. Even this explanation is an interpretation, so I don't think that the explanation is complete. I'm just amazed that someone came to the same conclusion, since I've always felt very alone with these thoughts."
UghFGOjL0kinfHgCoAEC,rh001YT,1504484922970,"This is a good lecture, but for those wanting a better understanding of these kinds of issues I recommend Kant's ""Critique of Pure Reason"",  wherein he gives a very accurate description of how the mind works on say a data processing and symbolic level, not getting into neuro-science as such had not been invented.  But Kant's book CPR is the basis of cognitive science and computer programming.

It is impossible to condense CPR because it is dense, which is typical of many Germans of the 18th century.  

I don't know for sure but I suspect Piaget based much of his underlying theory on Kant.

Here is a nutshell that is far from comprehensive:

1) The human is born with a mind that is blank of data, but does have templates or concepts into which data is fit, and no data that does not fit becomes known data...such data is excluded without even knowing it has been excluded.   
2) The foundational base concept, on which all other concepts rely, is spatio-temporal reasoning, meaning we can only think or concieve of the world in space, or dimensions,  and time, and those two, space and time are completely linked, can't have one without the other.
3) Then there is something else, sorting and sifting.  Since all data is arranged or slotted by the one template there is great similarity between data sets.  The sorting and sifting engine can compare data sets and find the significant similarities between some of them which then allows for guesses at general principles that may be governing the data sets. So for instance wave behavior in ponds resembled  wave behavior of sound waves and  frequencies beyond sound and so on.  Each data set of different wave behaviors was gathered only in certain particular situations but then sorting and sifting suggested something in common. So obviously data about apples did not contribute to wave theory. 
4) the math engine: the math engine itself is part of the conceptual template and is already there before any data is recieved. The math engine and he conceptual template may be one and the same.  Because humans can tell that math is self-validating it is used as a test to determine if suspected general rules might be candidates for general rules that are as self-evident as math.  So from disparate slices of wave data a math-consistent set of general rules was worked out, and that set of rules suggested wave frequencies may extend all the was up and down.  With the math-consistency providing some certainty about the guess, humans will make the effort to find missing data which is still needed to prove out the guess. And so all sorts of contraptions were build by scientists to trap or trick other frequencies into revealing themselves, and that worked well, and led to general electo-magnetic wave theory.   
5) For some reason Kant did not explain but pointed out, humans seek data to fill the empty templates. This is what we see happening when infants and toddlers touch and taste everything.  They are not yet seeing the world clearly, as their templates are mostly empty. By age of about 3 or 4 the toddler is actually seeing, hearing, etc the world pretty much the same  as anyone older such as teens and adults.  It's not that toddlers have blurry vision or a dull sense of smell, taste, touch, etc, it's that they have no idea what it is their sensing.  When the templates begin to be filled then the human sees the world, but only in the shape or organization of that template.  
6) Because humans are driven to seek data, as if the template itself demands more filling out, they seek up to infinity and down to infinity because the math underlying the template, or math being the template, readily suggests infinity like multiplication or division by 0.  

Lastly, Kant noted that if the templates(which are the concepts), and the math that forms them or grounds them or is one and the same with them contain errors then A) we will never know and B) there could be more ""stuff"" (my word) going on around us to which we are totally and permanently blind.  But we will just never know.  So we can only work with what we have as no choice of another template is available to us.  And then we might wonder what is more likely, that our most basic and fundamental tool for oraganizing the sensible world into consciousness is perfect, or imperfect? Still we will never know so we have to work with what we have. 

With regards Piaget, Kuhn, others, I go primarily with a Kantian view that there are not revolutions in science or knowledge or anything but gradual filling out of the templates.  Think of the templates as a database, and it's obvious that Kant's CPR forms the basic first idea of a database. We keep adding to the database and then sort and sift for similarities and differences to suggest general rules or partial general rules that then suggest more effort into finding out how valid those rules are, and if they are found valid or even 85% valid, such will often lead to finding new ways to manipulate the natural world.   And with more and more data, higher level rules may emerge that would not emerge with less data."

UghdVHctCAbo2XgCoAEC,andriod84,1504484923018,"Perhaps this is a good backbone for figuring out what psychedelics do to a person in the trip. Some people seem to say they feel like they revert to a child like innocence when in the trip. Perhaps they influence multiple 'action' sides of the model more then what would normally happen. A little tweak in one action when not tripping would not do anything, but because your high in the trip your doing multiple actions you wouldn't have done (all basically at once) this cascades to a different end point even though each action you do might only have been tweaked slightly.

  It might explain why psychedelics work the way they do, linking the mental effects with physical actions. Set and setting play an important part in a trip as well so how you interact with your physical actions during the trip would definitely influence you during and after the trip and might also explain better a 'bad trip'.

The last few days I've been thinking about what I call the ""holy family"". Father-Mother-Brother-Sister. And how fascinating it is that the same person can exist inside this framework but overtime, change roles. One lives as a son with a sister, mother, and father, and then 20 years later lives as a father with a wife, son, and daughter. And even if we didn't have a father growing up, we have a psychological ""father"" built into us, and a psychological mother, and sister, and so on. In other words we have these archetypes and we can't escape them. Western Civilization has been slowly but steadily erasing the father from the family. But something always has to take place of that. In the same way that the death of God leads to ideology and/or nihilism, the death of the father leads to much of the same, as the father in a child's life plays the role of ""God the Father"". One is protected by the father, one loves the father, and one fears the father. But if there is no father then one begins to love/fear and seek protection from some abstract version of the father, such as the state, or gangs, or capitalism, or communism, or what have you."

UghBDVSKfdnSiXgCoAEC,professormaxtrinity,1504484959820,"It's mind blowing to me that anyone could even perceive  current human experience through the notion of there being no gap between ""is"" and ""ought"". My own firsthand experience tells me that, I live in the very noticeable tension between is and ought. It's within that gap that I developed my ow personal mores and moral criteria. It's in that infinite creative  gap that I play with and develop ideas. Also, it seems that to suppose there is no gap is to suppose that all is as it ought to be or that, there is no ""ought"". These suppositions are true from a reflective and abstract sort of mental play but, they don't apply to living in real time social structure with millions of other free agents of creativity. They are more germane to the ground of imagination that we develop and pull ideas out of.

The gap and the gentle but, visceral tension of play between is and ought is observable and can be tracked through associative and emergence aspects of learning. Epiphanies can be traced back through trails of associations that lead to root assumptions. That's part of what makes the experience epiphanous , it's a full circle culmination quality of something that was building that you're unaware of until the moment of epiphany. In that instant you have a mini version of a classic N.D.E. life review only it's focused on  your experience with a particular subject. Epiphanies are emergent culminations of building knowledge and demonstrate directly, the inherent energetic state of knowledge. The tension between is and ought, the gap, is the fertile energy ground where all the associative play is executed and provides the conditions for learning, for epiphanies and peak experiences and for the creative molding of personal philosophies and personal paradigms.

Like physical pain, it is a signal that something about the harmony of your system has met an obstruction, it cannot flourish.. The shattering of perceptions that appeared to be working until they didn't. --- The tower that  you built has fallen, and hopefully something is resurrected from the rubble  (maybe after spending 3 days in a tomb  ) . --- how many times do your walls have to be shattered before you notice the thing coming from afar, after learning the signs and symptoms. --- how many times I have been caught saying, oh..this thing again? I thought I was above this, jeez. Why was I so blind? --- Developing sight really does seems to summarize the lesson here. 

I'm interested in the idea of what is relevant and that which engages our attention. It really gets me when it comes to identity politics. While I empathize with many of my fellow US citizens about their pain (race issues, humans rights, guns etc) what really engages my attention and emotional systems is the environmentalism story. I like the environmentalism story because it appears to me that none of that other stuff will really matter when the ocean is so acidic no one can swim in it , all the water is polluted, and I can't go outside anymore because my skin can't take the sun. People may agonize over whether or not the media is body shaming women and what campaign we must follow to stop the degradation of our girls and women, but they'll still take a plane (by far the largest polluter when it comes to travel) to vacation in Hawaii.  Perhaps, it's because the environmental catastrophe is still too abstract to engage their attention. You have said ""people don't have ideas, ideas have people"" is it ideology that captures the imagination so heavily that it becomes blind to everything outside of it? They consider flying all over the world for pleasure to be a normal activity for a person in their position. 

How do I extrapolate that  my environmental awareness is the way to be in world that constitutes a moral truth? When someone else might say that it is relative to whatever is close enough to my heart strings for me to care. It feels like we live in a world where we are constantly flooded with information asking us what to care about. It's extremely overwhelming.

Wouldn't this higher volume and concentrated feedback loop of reactions result in the person having a significantly harder time getting to that new level of understanding you spoke about at the start?

Is it possible we are seeing a generation (or two) of people who will not be able to, mature, for a lack of a better word? 

Could we start seeing a devolution in our ability to individually separate real danger from the collective noise?

This might seem simplistic, but I am old enough to remember the simpler things in life, like eating dirt."
UghR2pfwNIIDT3gCoAEC,Christo,1504484987264,As a student of psychology I have not yet encountered during my education a single lecture that stands in comparison with what Dr Peterson presents here. What an icredible opportunity to be able to take this class from half-way around the world. The insights into the practice of psychotherapy I found especially gripping and useful. Thank you so much!

UgiB207_Um_y43gCoAEC,pipippu89,1504484987311,"I watched Jordan's old lecture ""Reality and the Sacred"" many times recently.
This was a lecture from 2009 I think. That lecture was so enlightening and exciting.

In some of the more recent lectures I felt Jordan felt a bit exhausted or lifeless in comparision with that older speech. I thought, that maybe it has to simply to do with age but maybe he also had a lot of more stress since his recent public exposure. I did not get that same emotion from his more recent lectures.

But in this lecture he was really on fire and seemed really on his A-Game. He seemed way more lively here.

I hope you take good care of your health and your life Jordan - I hope I can still enjoy your lectures and your knowledge and use it to improve my own life for a long time!

You definitely had me questioning a lot of my previous beliefs about the world, thanks for your work!

Cheers, Philipp"
