In the last two decades I have observed an explosion of True Believers appear around the world. People who are determined to ""make a difference"", and the first thing they resort to is the adoption of an ideology. A cause. Something to attach their lives to because if they didn't they would feel their lives are superfluous and therefore meaningless. The keystone to the antidote is the active involvement of fathers in the lives of their children from birth. Marxists know this intuitively if not explicitly, and that is why they have taken steps to force the father's influence out of the family.

Eric Hoffer wrote at length on this human tendency in his works, particularly The True Believer, The Ordeal of Change, and The Passionate State of Mind. He explains why people join a mass movement, and the human deficiency that promotes it. Easy reads, exceptionally lucid, and still available for a sawbuck or two. Sometimes the local library system has them.

Hannah Arendt covers similar ground in her treatise of Totalitarianism. A substantial portion of her writings mirror Eric's, from a socio-political perspective. She also covers to a limited extent the revolutionary mind, which Billington details in his Fire in the Minds of Men. I found her writings also available in the library system. Both these authors originated in Germany during WWII. Both were trying to alert the world how German society went wrong, and how the trends were spreading."

The Other Element
The structure was set and the rules were laid down
scaffolds set in history
a doctrine of nobility to adopt the suffering of the world
In some small part
In some untold whisper that echoes only in the mind of a
humble man?
The humble men now fell humbly to the structures
the structures now built themselves around those men on their knees
the men crumbled and melted
morphed and melded, until they became no more than this:
a shadow mass with no eyes or ears
Ambient technological overtones let the shadow spill

into - over - under - through

now you have become shadow.
You are the shadow
you are the Shadow
You Are The Shadow.

Now as a Shadow, what do You do?
You do nothing.
The Shadow is Most High and the Shadow's Will is All
Now the Shadow worships itself
The Shadow clings to the structures and You tear at them wildly!
With your Shadowy Claws and with your Shadowy Fangs
and Faceless Screams that seem to emerge only from Shadow...

Society gone
Shadow remains
the beauty of life no more than 
a stain

You realize too late now when everything's lost
Becoming The Shadow Has The Highest Cost"

He barely has more than the two players who follow him combined, and represents a tiny portion of goals and assists by all the players ever played (in NHL history or even in any given season or the time Wayne was active).

JP's criticism around the complexity of maintaining idealistic institutional superstructures is actually very insightful and well put.  However, his comments on the ""Pareto distribution"" and the basic idea that class stratification is justified on this basis are totally insane.  No person outperforms others to a degree that would ethically justify the wealth inequality produced under our current economic paradigm, and to suggest that this is a direct consequence of taking responsibility for oneself is a truly cruel lie, exactly of the same sort used to justify the existence of unquestioned authority such as the very USSR he points to here.

The lesson we must take from the cruelty of the USSR is not to superficially hate leftism, but rather the opposite: we must understand that pragmatic reality and human empathy must supercede any underlying ideology, including one that blames mere individual irresponsibility for our ails."

Pol Pot did not kill 6 million Cambodians, he killed nearly 1 million by violent means, more than another million by over work and starvation. This two million was at least a quarter of the population in four years of Pol Pot's rule of Cambodia, in percentage terms a record death toll inflicted by a tyrant on his own people in peacetime."
Ugz8NBL7f6gltTdFCUJ4AaABAg,Chas No,1530664393225,"So his name was Hubert Mungus, so what?  Or maybe it was a reference to the character Lord Humongous in the movie ""The Road Warrior""  Anyway, you knew that he was a smart and savvy player when he went with the humongous thing, did so with a smile, and stayed in character, despite aggression on the part of his interrogator.  Obviously, H-man is a smart and funny guy.  What a nice guy!
The way that she instantly assumed that ""humongous"" was referring to his penis, even though he made no such reference, and the way she kept demanding that he make such a reference, which can be inferred from her later and much repeated claim of sexual harrrassment, indicates that she was looking for a sex-based fight, and was so disappointed that she didn't get it, that she redirected her aggression against security personnel, who were professional and restrained in the face of her indecency towards them.
Yes, it is really horrible when the Soviets, or their stand-ins, bury you, without the decency of killing you first, but that's how Marxists roll.  When they can't afford a bullet for your head, they skip the bullet, and just bury you.  They're indecent like, but indecency is the essence of Marxism.
The Nazi death camps continued beyond the end of the Second World War.  Those horrors were extended by the Soviet Union under Communism, or Marxism.
I love Jordan Peterson's literary references.  I'm inclined to that myself, having majored in English and French.  He validates me, and I approve of that.  As should we all.

UgzZs6XdLfn1HV8qCRl4AaABAg,Alice Stanford,1525394002190,"There's lots of very good stuff in this video, and plenty of sincere passion. Yes, we need to know about Solzhenitsyn's work - and I applaud the moral of your story about truth telling and responsibility. But it's a pity that you push a conspiracy theory and allow kids to see you as the hero rescuing Solzhenitsyn from wanton neglect. I was alive when his works were first translated into English and he got mega-publicity then. Why he is no longer taught in universities is a puzzle. It is not that there are no anti-totalitarian, or no right wing intellectuals. I've met some of them.

You attack a straw man when you attack the view that the USSR was ""not real communism"". Where is the argument in this lecture that shows that communism - as a means of social organization - has to be a totalizing system that cannot acknowledge diversity or individuality? (Elsewhere you treat the left's attachment to multiculturalism with throwaway contempt - but it is an indication of an impulse to allow more in rather than force a single pattern on everyone.) Why did totalitarianism appear on the right and the left at the same time? Why were similar impulses at play in Revolutionary France? Couldn't it simply be that violent disjunctive chance unleashes forces of all sorts that tend to simplistic rule based, bureaucratic and punitive control. Arguing that all the previous experiments (Russia, China, Cambodia etc) have all produced the same outcome does not prove that that outcome is the inevitable shape of a communist society, only that a certain pattern emerges when peasant societies try to jump to a post-capitalist system - particularly when all those  are looking towards the USSR/Leninist theory as their model.

I am not a communist, myself. Nor am I a political theorist. But if I find these objections boiling up in my mind in response to your lecture, perhaps many, many other people have the same experience. (Don't think those who take your classes will necessarily ""speak truth to power"" and challenge you. As you know very well there are a lot of pressures on them not to do so.)

As for the poor mother who wrote to her daughter she was guilty - that was no lie. She was guilty of not being able to protect her daughter and provide a real attachment figure/place of safety that would enable that daughter to grow. Was she supposed to write the ""truth"" that she was not guilty of what she was accused of an condemn her daughter (a child) to being treated just as she was treated? I find that part of the lecture really lacking in compassion and insight."

A simplified view of the roots of WW2 in which the ""good forces"" such as Industry & money had as big a hand in starting the war as as Nazism. Peterson is a bit flaked out in his anti-commie bias. If for instance there had been 50 million Natives here in the US when Europeans arrived, we'd have 45 million dead of those. The prospective dead at Nagasaki were a consequence of the weather over other targets. Death numbers often imply circumstances, not levels of evil."

I would recommend you to read about the atrocities that were happening in the Romanian prisons during the communist time, more specific the Pitesti experiment. The people were tortured, humiliated in the worst possible way, starved, made the inmates to beat each other till they couldn't move, if not they were being beaten/punished by the guards, it's just out of this world. The most important detail of this experiment, is that it as performed on mostly deep religious people. It was design to kill every humane trait in a person's life, especially of a religious one. 
""However, what has not yet become universal knowledge is the fact that in the Romanian Gulag Archipelago there was an island of absolute horror, such as existed nowhere else in the entire geography of the communist penitentiary system: Pitesti Prison."" 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn himself described this ""experiment"", as the ""most terrible act of barbarism in the contemporary world"".

I hope you will see my comment, read about it, and bring it as an example in your further lectures. It's has to be know.....
Thank you very much."

While I'm at it I wanted to recommend a series of four published books that are made up of Soviet samizdat (meaning ""for the desk drawer"").  Solzhenitsyn was responsible for the publication of these volumes I believe. He and Maximov. They are called Kontinent I, Kontinent Ii, Kontinent III, Kontinent IV.

First I have to tell you that the one good thing about the terrible political system under the Soviet Union, and I feel guilty for saying and feeling this, is that it did something that pretty much isn't done to us here in the West. And that is that those who rebelled against that system risked absolutely everything including their lives.

I like to say that it turned them either into alcoholics or diamonds. And in the case of Vladimir Vysotsky, both :-)

But if you Google for instance the story ""and even our tears"" I think you can find that online. I made it available. It comes from one of the Kontinent volumes and it is so alive it will blow your mind.  It's also about the camps.

By the way, you will note that another diamond that was created by a totalitarian event (Bill C 16) is Jordan Peterson."

UgyCnTr2-GeOqI0tIrR4AaABAg,P N,1515026026505,There is a documentary that I saw 30 or so years ago called The Killing Fields and it is about the Cambodian genocide under Pol Pot. It's still around.

UgwaPosgxnwY2scKbf94AaABAg,P N,1515026026516,"The great Soviet poet Osip Mandelstam was married to Nadezhda Mandelstam. Osip died in the camps in the thirties. His wife has written two memoirs. Her name NADEZHDA means HOPE. Her first memoir is called hope against hope and the second is called hope abandoned.  She saved her husband's poetry by memorizing it.

These two volumes of memoirs are super fascinating. One thing I remember:  her husband was puzzled by this new word called progress, what did progress MEAN?  when he was told, and had internally absorbed the insanity of the notion, he broke down sobbing inconsolably.  

And don't think he's a wimp or an idiot. He understood I believe that ideology comes from this belief in some future ideal, that we actually supposedly ""head towards"" something called progress.  Marxism of course is predicated on this.

Utopias are always based on the future, and the notion of a progress toward the future that will be ideal.

And in placing who the Mandelstams are. They were very good friends with Varlam Shalamov whose short stories about the camps are in two English volumes entitled Graphite and Kolyma Tales. Solzhenitsyn had asked him to write the Gulag with him but he was too old and sick from being in the camps himself.

Related also to what JBP tells of in this very powerful YouTube video that you're watching now:  there is a superb story by Jacques Lusseyran called Jeremy.  You need to read it. It is a true story from Lusseyran's time in Buchenwald.  Jeremy has  amazing Insight yet he is a common man.  A matter of fact man. But he made a huge difference in the camps because he had a an inner spiritual presence from facing life and knowing what it is about.  His insight is simple but unbelievably fascinating.

Lusseyran is known as the blind hero of the French Resistance. He survived the camp.

Another truly amazing story of his which is also a true story is called Poetry in Buchenwald."

Ugxo7fgXHfSqVuppvVV4AaABAg,Luke Majewski,1512347632961,"My aunt's mother, now an old woman, was sent to the gulag by the soviets from post war communist Poland because her family were of old nobility. Reason being that their land was now the property of the ""people"" . She survived because as a young girl she was one of the few people in the camp that knew how to read, write and add. She was the book keeper for the camp and for it she got grain and and potato peelings she shared with her mother and sister. She told me that when they were released from the train, they were given a shovel and a small hand axe and left to their own. There were no walls of barb wire to keep them there, and the guards simply stated that if they wanted to escape they could. And why not, in every direction it was a thousand kilometers of tundra , and nothing else. They dug holes in the ground as housing, and in the summer it was the only shelter from swarms of mosquitoes. They were in charge of cattle and she described a moment when one of the cows died, the people with bare hands minced the animal and covered the blood in dirt and snow so there was no trace of it, within minutes. To this day when when she sees the color red on TV, she turns the channel. 

This is not a story from a book, the people that went though this are still out there, many in Poland and Russia. This isn't even the distant past. You can believe  me or not but growing up in Poland at the end of communism I got to hear many first hand experiences from people like her. Even my own grandmother who remembers the soviet ""heroes"" shooting a boy in the head because he wouldn't give them his bike. No German officer, or even plain soldier was ever this animalistic and she feared our saviors far more than the occupants."

It's not about the pirito distribution, but the idea that mankind needs these big overarching hierarchical institutions to ""govern"" it. The truth is no it doesn't. The responsibility and risks of a global system if small regional familial governments without institutions like the un outweighs the guarantee of tiranny. In one you have freedom, responsibility and risk and in the other you have a life designed and laid out by the ultimately corrupt to whom you will be nothing but a slave and you'll be discarded like garbage when youre no longer of use for the machine. And it's not coming in the form of a satanic zionist takeover. That's just one side of the divide and conquer strategy. It wil come under the veil of christianity.

I have been told that while the holocaust has evidence, this text has none, and thus they dismiss it out right in an argument against such collectivist positions. Naturally, given the nature of the text, I haven't been able to find supporting evidence myself, and I'm desperate to have a single source to present and say, ""do you see how disgusting you are for dismissing these crimes as lies?"" Still, I don't have that source, and if I did they would naturally dismiss it without care for the same ideological reasons. And so without supporting evidence I have stopped using the text in any argument and I'm forced to point out the lack of evidence of socialism or communism ever functioning as anything more than a disastrous campaign of civil atrocity.

- Abodah Zarah 8.5: If a non-Jew kills a non-Jew or a Jew, he is responsible, but if a non-Jew is killed by a Jew, the Jew is not responsible.
- Baba Kama 113a: It is permissible to deceive and cheat if the law is against Jews.
- Abodah Zarah 26d Tos .; Kiddushin 66c; Soferim XV, rule 10: The best of non-Jews must also be killed.

I am currently engaged in reading this book, and it is too much sometimes to take in large doses. I read a chapter, or even sometimes just a few pages, and I must put it down and meditate on what I've just read. Everyone owes it to themselves to read this book, especially given the current political climate of the western world. 
It is very interesting that this woman, upon hearing HM state his [name], automatically - like a computer algorithm - assumed that he was using a euphemism about a particular part of his anatomy, and the part most convenient for her chosen purpose. How does she know he wasn't stating his YT channel name? How does she know he was not adopting this moniker as a way of referring to his pot belly. These ideological slaves have been programmed to search in desperation for anything that can be highlighted as an offence against their identity or adopted identity group, or even against their ideological tenets. 
If we don't rise up in resistance against these political ideologies that have made such a terrifying resurgence of late - and do it PDQ - we will be reading more books like the Gulag Archipelago 50 to 100 years from now. Food for thought.....

The table before you is not real, but you, the observer, are.
Reality is proceedurally generated.

You cannot die, but you can be subsumed by general flow of Consciousness. These words are joining your mind to mine, therefore I have subsumed your consciousness. Does it distress you? Of cause not. And the same process happens when you die, 
So death is inconsequential other than the physical suffering of dying.

And why are you alive?
Consciousness decides to give you the power to observe and to increase Love. The experiences of the beings (Chiliviek) in the Gulags chose those lessons for the experience.

Generally speaking, people tend to forget how Russia's grain export prior to World War I had generated more revenue than all of Germany's industry combined, we can just imagine what they could've achieved if they had implemented the intended Japanese model of modernization, rather than the Western one which the Bolsheviks had implemented, the one that came with a massive cost to native human and material resources, and of course, to prevent Russia from furthering its Pan-Slavic agenda in continental Europe, which would've surely toppled the Germanic grip over most of Central, portions of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and grant Russia a passage to the Mediterranean sea.

UgjNakQg6otIv3gCoAEC,Bryan Croteau,1504485259644,"Professor Peterson mentions the game Monopoly about 20 minutes into the video and talks a bit about coin flipping. This actually a fairly common example: it is included in the postscript speech by Warren Buffet at the end of ""The Intelligent Investor,"" and it is mentioned in Nassim Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness.""

In the case of Monopoly however, the coin flipping explanation is actually only half of the picture. The other element, Positive Feedback, is a core principle of game design. The more property that you have in Monopoly, the more people give you money, and the more property you buy. It's a virtuous circle. The random element of Monopoly really only applies to the first few turns. Once the leading player starts to snowball, the game might as well end, because it is almost mathematically impossible for that player to lose.

As Yuval Noah Harari points out in ""Sapiens,"" accident compounded by positive feedback explains most of history.

The optimal strategy in Monopoly is to simply spend money as fast as you get it so that you have a fair chance of snowballing. Anyone who does not participate in this strategy is not actually playing the game. This can be abstracted into a solution to the ""set of all possible dominance hierarchies"" problem in the following way: people who do not invest 100% of their resources into future growth are simply not playing the game."

""I have seen the unshakable strength of the idea of social good that was born in my own country. I saw this struggle during the period of general collectivization and again in 1937. I saw people being annihilated in the name of an idea of good as fine and humane as the ideal of Christianity. I saw whole villages dying of hunger; I saw peasant children dying on the snows of Siberia; I saw trains bound for Siberia with hundreds of thousands of men and women from Moscow, Leningrad and every city in Russia - men and women who had been declared enemies of a great and bright idea of social good. This idea was something fine and noble -yet it killed some without mercy, crippled the lives of others, and separated wives from husbands and children from fathers.

...Yes, as well as this terrible Good with a capital ""G"", there is everyday human kindness. The kindness of an old woman carrying a piece of bread to a prisoner, the kindness of a soldier allowing a wounded enemy to drink from his water-flask, the kindness of youth towards age, the kindess of a peasant hiding an old Jew in his loft. The kindness of a prison guard who risks his own liberty to pass on letters written by a prisoner not to his ideological comrades, but to his wife and mother.

The private kindness of one individual towards another; a petty, thoughtless kindness; an unwitnessed kindness. Something we could call senseless kindness. A kindness outside any system of social or religious good."""

There are empowered and powerful cultures that have WAY too much influence and control over the last 50 or more years. They continue to gain more and more power, control much of the media, tell us what to believe of history, rights, education, AND they control much of the WEST'S politicians AND media, finance and FOREIGN POLICY. Now we fight wars for them, believe them to be the most moral, brilliant and valued culture. They protect their arrogance by claiming to be perpetual VICTIMS - and as paranoid narcissists, they hate and want to dominate all OTHERS - and they are the same culture that CONQUERED RUSSIAN IN 1917 AND KILLED MILLIONS RIGHTEOUSLY and seek to hide that incredible history.

That is Marxist logic - from each according to his ability (single unmarried guy with disposable income = high rent) to each according to his need (hey my mortgage is high so I need your cash). 
This Marxist teacher also told me he was for unilateral disarmament because it would be better for the USA to be incinerated than continue consuming the world's resources.

UghAjED8-Xb_EngCoAEC,Michael Samo,1504485284401,"There is something therapeutic about Jordan Peterson's lectures. Last couple of years I can't rid myself from the notion that nihilism and moral relativism is rationally correct cause people always have inconsistencies and double standards. 

One of the things that made me thinking so is treatment and consumption of animals. I am not vegan however I can't escape the contradiction that deep in my gut I despise slavery but don't mind animals slaughtered by the billions for us to enjoy their taste. I could never reconcile this and other cases of moral inconsistency and outright hypocrisy. Even if I become vegan I still will know that there is 1001 things we do for our enjoyment that kill animals as a result. 

Philosophy won't help ether, for example  - one of the strong arguments for utilitarian moral approach is that it has actual objective measure - do things that cause the most amount of happiness and least amount of suffering. However there are lots of cases that acting in such a way will create nonsensical scenarios such as doctor killing a healthy patient to collect his organs and save 5 other patients that will die if they won't get the organs. So most of people will agree that some things are just wrong no matter what utility they have on a moral level. And I believe the reason for nihilism is that we just can't agree on what these things are, and  that over history some things that were completely fine now illegal and otherwise. 

What I understand from Jordan is that human psyche goes beyond such things as rationality and logic and concepts like good and evil, morality and ethics have very deep psychological roots that goes beyond rational and logical. Such things could be described by mythology and archetypes. And the reason why ideologies, no matter how rational they appear to be, will never be able to organize human society in a way that is compelling to human psyche is because the roots of morality and values go much deeper into unconscious mind. Just think for a second where our morality come from. It comes from our culture, it comes from our family, from our own judgement, from our motivation, from our notion of universal values and more so if you try to find a consistent moral theory good luck with that... 

I like one of his examples - He says that it is logical that life has no meaning, but as a human being when you think about it you will probably have negative emotions. And the question is why would one think that nothing matters? Most of us will say - well because it is true or that what science suggests. And what he says is that maybe the reason you believe that nothing matters is because it is the bad and negative part of your personality wants to believe it.. the part that want everything be measurable. And the more smart and intellectual the more these ideas have a hold on you. 
Joseph Gobbles was very smart and intellectual but it didn't hold him to become a minister of propaganda in the Nazi regime and actually it probably helped him to be as such."
UggzumnkW31fc3gCoAEC,Ornicar Ornicar,1504485284413,"Too bad he is blind to the same atrocities when they are committed by religions, in the name of archetypal myths. He is sharp but so partial to his local mythology. Someone as clever and interesting as he is should realise that the worst possible way to justify beliefs is to do so by faith, because that is when no confrontation is ever fruitful. When beliefs are justified with no argument whatsoever (""that is what I chose to believe"") then antagonistic ideas can never merge. That is why religions always split and never merge, as opposed to science, that produces worldwide shared representations. He is as convinced as any that rationality is the way things must be studied (otherwise he couldn't make a coherent lecture, or he couldn't explain why he works with the Big 5 without doing so rationally...) but he has to give that up every now and then to make room for his pet mythology, never mentioning the inquisition and religion wars, martyrdom, ritual mutilations, religious terrorism, obscurantism or theocracies. That really makes the whole thing sound like a personal and convenient interpretation of ambivalent and ambiguous legends. As if a morality could be cherry-picked from holly texts without pre-existing moral criteria in the reader's mind. Good luck with that. We've seen how well that goes, whatever the religion. Burning witches or beheading infidels. And modern Russia is not going to be nice either.

Solzhenitsyn got his notoriety by being promoted by anti-Soviet CIA apparatus of the Cold War era, specifically by CIA run Voice of America radio,  the 5th column chipping away at the Iron Curtain.  

Solzhenitsyn was not only a literary fraud, but he was proven to write condemning accusation reports on his peers to NKVD, was known to have a wretched personality and low morals, giving him a psychological profile of a pathological liar.  These are not ad hominem attacks on his character, he did suffer a breakdown in combat and attempted to flee the battlefield, thus the reason for his incarceration, and while PTSD is well studied in our times, on the front lines of WWII Eastern Front it was a crime to abandon your position with out orders, as panic in the troops is the first enemy.  

Whatever psychological damage Solzhenitsyn suffered, and whatever decisions and actions he took due to his psychological breakdown are his personal issues, but his literary works are a fraud, a gross misrepresentation of historical reality, and at best could only be counted as his subjective expiriance through the distorted lens of PTSD trauma.  

The sad part is that there are countless of Russian sources that covered this in depth and it has been known for years, yet the myth of Solzhenitsyn's supposed literary achievements exists only in the West, as he is the darling populist poster child of how awful the totalitarian regime of USSR was.   

In personal reality, both of my grandfathers fought on the Eastern front, both were wounded in combat, both were captured as POWs, both survived German POW camps, and after multiple attempts both escaped and both made across front lines to friendly territory.   They were not executed, they were not tortured or sent to Siberia for cowardice.

Yes, life was tough back then. Some people were in prisons and labor camps. However most of the people lived well and happy. Is it fare to talk only about the dark side?
Prison rates in US are highest in the world. Can we conclude that capitalism is evil after reading some inmate's book who was raped and bitten for years in a US prison?
Many contemporary Russians believe that the Solzhenitsyn's book and believing that Soviet Union was a criminal regime (similar to Fascism) is just an ideological weapon against Russia. Because if it was a criminal regime, then Russia's current territory is not legitimate."

Ugj9U-J5eWZ99ngCoAEC,LCD M,1504485313259,"Professor Peterson, I respect your work a lot, but you've been saying something that is not accurate.
You said the majority of the wealth always accumulate in the hands of a few, this is of course true when it comes to money and nominal value of assets, or when it comes to totalitarian regimes, but is definitely not true when it comes to free market capitalism (hence why so many have been lifted out of poverty in a system that more or less resembles free market capitalism).

But in a free market economy the wealth accumulated by the top is just a small fraction of the wealth outputted from them to the world.
Meaning, the top 1-10% do not own the majority of the cars, food, clothes, furniture, mobile phones, computers, etc... Those things (the wealth) is owned by the people, the top 1% only have the stocks of some of the companies producing all this wealth but not the wealth itself, and a lot of those companies are divided in shares that are owned by the people. 

I just would like to point that out, because the way you say it makes it sound completely unfair and as if there was a problem that needed solving, which is absolutely not the case, the problem has been solved and the solution is free market capitalism."
UgjkkHTvnrgIaHgCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485313280,"Human all too human.  Men will protect their stalk come hell or high water.  

Under capitalism King Leopold the Second, a Belgian king, killed 15 million Africans in the name of establishing his rubber plant. The Congolese have no impressive written poetry to reference seeing that untold numbers of them who slaved away in these rubber plants had no hands.  That's right, little Congolese boys forced to harvest and tap rubber were maimed for not meeting daily quotas.  You must understand though they lived in Congo Free State so it's okay.  Venture capitalism is natural!  I have no problem with that, because ABSOLUTE VICIOUSNESS IS NATURAL, observe wolves.   A super pack wolves will  kill a surplus  that they will not eat or return to later to eat.  They do it because they can. 

I can weep about about sharks altering their migration patterns to follow the Atlantic slave trade routes.  They were so well fed from dead and sometimes living slaves.  They gorged themselves on the table scrapes of capitalism.  Ohhhh, can't tell my history because that is ""WHITE GUILT.""  Oooopsie.  Forgot, only certain suffering counts for legitimate consideration of political and economic formulation.

I love how people talk about genocide. Jews and Cambodians are still with us.  Great!  I love them both.  Really I do!  What about EXTINCTION though!  the Aboriginal Tasmanian people are EXTINCT!  The British colonialists wiped them out.  No more! Gone! Done! Capitalism!

The French Revolution was a MERCANTILE REVOLUTION.  What happened when the forces of unrestricted free market prevailed? THE REIGN OF TERROR.  That phrase was coined by the newly minted powers as they sharpened their guillotine.  Oh the Capitalists  know how to take heads too, literally!

Sorry Capitalism is not the good twin, it is just the successful one.   Successful does not equal moral.  Pimping is more lucrative than leaf blowing.  Heads of industry are largely pathological.  I need not defend that statement but simply underline it.  I am no Trump supporter, but he rightly called the banks and top investors he filed bankruptcy on ""killers"" in response to Mike Wallace's innocent portrayal of top level players that were stiffed by an exploited bank rule.  It takes a certain mentality, an one the spot, blood chilling, ruthless decision making ability to reach those rarefied spaces.  

Anyone who knows law, knows the real law is commercial law. This law can not be transgressed without a pound of flesh in return.

The truth is right wing oppression is the father of left wing radicalism.  That Indian woman was aggressive because she needs to be.  I am not saying she could have used more tact, but then again, how much tact did the Aboriginal Tasmanian have?  Oh yeah, we don't know because dead men tell no tales.  

I've seen this movie before.  Brown suffering is unhinged, unscrupulous, pampered, self-satisfied, vapid, and self righteous an can be chucked together with sexually confused people.  However white suffering peoples are wise with deep lessons to forged in the furnace of trail and turmoil. Lol, can't you see, can't you see, freedom TAKES TURNS.  I hate saying that, really I do.  I desperately want someone to prove me wrong.  However I have yet to see this done.  I want happiness, prosperity, freedom and unity with all peoples of the earth, but wants do not dictate the look or motion of reality."

UgitLxCGSWcd-ngCoAEC,zaxxxon,1504485313328,"WOW!!! Thank you Pr Peterson. This is my first sitting all the way through one of your lectures. What got me to click was Solzhenitsyn picture, and, being a history buff, I was swept in from the get go. I read the Goulag Archipelago in the early 1980s so your talk resonated quite a bit with me. Having recently read Cancer Ward, I'm about to undertake One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich.  

Early on, you talked about the fake factories and villages the soviets would set up to impress their foreign visitors, and it got me thinking about what the nazis did, in 1943-44, in the Bohemian small town (or camp-ghetto) of Terezin, near Prague, where they created a ""model Jewish city"", where, on June 23, 1944, the Red Cross delegates declared themselves so satisfied that they abandoned their next scheduled stop: Birkenau...

About May 1968, I lived it, in Montreal where I was attending grade 2 at Collège Stanislas (an off-shoot of a Parisian establishment of the same name), and where the students who were about to graduate occupied the school for an afternoon and 10-12 of them carried a teacher's Austin Mini up a dozen stairs into the school's main lobby, across the street from us. :-)

In closing, may I add that your 20th century totalitarian examples take root in earlier events. One such event happened in Florence, at the time of America's discovery, and right before the Reformation: Savonarole's Bonfires of the vanities."

Maybe this makes me a terrible person. But every time I hear about the fate of these communists it brings a persistent smile to my face. It´s like pigs building a slautherhouse. I´d watch it with popcorn.
Even if it wasn´t their own fault mostly, the world would still be better off without them. And were such horror only to befall them, I would feel no need to help them.
Thinking about this always strains my ability so view (all) humans as people and reminds me of my own darkest side. Because while on a rational level I can hold on to the Idea of the divine Individual, I can not muster up any sympathy. And while I would reluctantly do my part as soon as someone starts adressing the issue, I would never be the first to adress it.

Personally, from my own studies of the bible and related literature, I see Satan much more as a personification of the evil of individualism over collectivism - in this specific case, the sin of glorifying the self over the glory of god and his flock. I should mention that I don't necessarily agree with this  idea.

Ugizaw0zjxRLqngCoAEC,shananagans5,1504485325839,"When I was in college my best friend had defected from the USSR. She was working as a translator for scientists assembling a small, portable nuclear reactor as part of a joint project with the US. 
I think lots of young people don't know, or believe how strict the USSR was. The entire group from the USSR was staying at an appt complex. They chose that particular complex because it had good security. The complex had a large wall around it with 3 exits. While at the complex they were free to go to the pool & the rec center etc. That's where I met my friend, but, there were Russian guards at every exit. Every morning, no joke, a prison bus pulled up & they all filed onto the bus to be transported to work. They were literally prisoners. Exactly like you see in the movies or the stories you hear about Olympic athletes in the 70's, they had minders that watched them 24/7.
Anyways, late one night my friend called me from a 7-11 that was about a mile from the appt complex. She told me she had escaped & she was defecting & wanted me to pic her up & help her hide. I got dressed & when I went out to the parking lot, the Russian minder actually stopped me & asked me where I was going. They new I had become friends with one of the people they were there to guard. He didn't speak English real well but it was clear to me he suspected I was up to something because I was leaving at 3 AM. I told him my mom was sick & needed my help. I got in my car & drove off in a different direction from the 7-11. I drove around for a while to make sure I wasn't being followed, then I went & picked my friend up. She told me she thought they didn't know she had defected yet. I told her abut the guy questioning me when I left. Then she freaked out. She immediately knew they talked to me because I was friends with her & I was leaving at an odd time. She knew they suspected I was trying to help her defect but they didn't have the power to physically restrain me. I really thought she was being paranoid, I just didn't believe they were watching their people that closely. I took her to one of my friends houses & I called another friend that lived in the appt complex. He looked out the window & they had all the Russian scientists lined up against the wall & the security guys were going through their appts & questioning them. They were looking for my friend that had just defected. 
She wasn't being paranoid. They knew we had become friends & they were watching me too. When I left late that night, they checked on my friend & found her missing so they were grilling everyone in their group at 3:30 AM. 
lol At that point I got paranoid. I was thinking if they were watching that closely they may have the phones in the appt complex tapped. They didn't but I had just called someone there & told them everything we had just done. I was explaining why I was calling at 3:30 AM & asking him to look out the window. Anyways, that possibility scared us & we moved her to another persons home. 
We did get her to the proper authorities in the next few days & she got political asylum & eventually citizenship. 
Anyways, the reason I tell this story is because if anyone believes life was good in the USSR they are fooling themselves. My friend & all the scientists were living in the US in an appt complex with Americans but they were being watched closely & they were essentially prisoners. Had my friend been caught before she got political asylum, they would have physically taken her back to the USSR & thrown her in prison.
Even 2 years later, she was in the car with me when I got pulled over. I had pushed a yellow light & got pulled over. She was so frightened of having an interaction with the police she broke down in tears & had a panic attack. The cop was very nice, he gave me a warning & was very polite. She said people in Russia get taken away & never seen again for less. 
Under Soviet rule, people were living in fear. 
Now, my friend is in her mid 50's & she is having issues with her bones because when she was young, she had long periods when she didn't get even basic nourishment & she grew up in Leningrad during a time when the USSR wasn't having exceptional issues. Even in the ""good"" times, food was hard to come by. 
The first time we took her to a US supermarket, it really was like what you see in the movies. She was floored by all the food & all the choices. She had never seen anything like that. She really was used to standing in line for hours to get whatever they had. 
When you see these things from the 70's & 80's it's 100% true. That isn't propaganda. 
People were living in fear, afraid they could be carted off for years for the smallest infraction. People were going to bed hungry, even during the good times. Hot water was a luxury & heat was not a given. Even in the 1980's she had never even seen an air conditioner. She had been in air conditioned buildings but to have AC in a home was something she had not even realized was a possibility prior to her coming to the US. 
To all you social justice warriors out there wanting socialism/communism are wrong. You are just wrong. It's an evil system that doesn't work. Even in the ""good times"" people suffer & in the bad times, truly evil things happen on massive scales. 
With many things in life, differing opinions don't necessarily mean one side is right & one is wrong. Communism vs. Capitalism is not one of those things. Communism causes human suffering. You CAN NOT deny that honestly. You are either fooling yourself or you are terribly ignorant of the facts."

Then I realised the man was right! The political discourse has been so dominated by identity politics, gay rights in a large part, that people get elected regardless of their competence. Competence is not discussed that much anymore, it is replaced with discussions about the candidate's ""moral virtues"" regarding ""oppressed people"". When all the election is about gay rights, a politician that would build proper dykes never gets elected.

They are called ""The Last Resort Letters"" and prime ministers are said to become white when they are given the task.
Each letter is then transferred to a dual key safe on each Trident submarine and is burned without opening whenever the prime minister changes in the UK.

I belonged to that environment, in which I was born, but when I tried to talk about that with my father, his reaction was vitriolic: I understood that his generation had been largely brainwashed and my questioning the goodness of Communism was the infringement of an untouchable taboo, the subversion of the moral legends on which the cultural left stands.

I would not try to live during such a period. look at how many slaves there are compared to the men enslaving them. why are humans such cowards? torture is so terrible but they are already torturing you... so this is what statism does to you - it makes you into such an helpless child that you take punishments from psychos and do nothing. perhaps the best thing to do in such a situation is to force the evil ones to murder you quickly least they turn you into another jesus christ who suffered with horrible tortures. suicide is salvation if you wish to escape from hell. it's scary how much the peoples of the USA already resemble the types of mindsets the russians had. fools! did you not notice how many people who have committed non-violent crimes are being imprisoned? oh wait, you don't care about that because they broke the law and are criminals... heh. and besides what could you do against a mindless and powerful bureaucracy? and what have any of us to do with the evils that we do not care about because they are not directly affecting us yet? woe woe woe to the man who does not obey god for he shall obey something infinitely inferior. but things can get a lot worse and what god is to most is just a devil and a fairy tail. apparently hitler took away all rights in about 2 months. things can get very bad very quickly. how perplexing it is to see human beings falling into such a deep captivity to techniques. for a mother to not even care about her children... this one is so lost that she basically has no soul. she is near completely mechanized."

Men of the West became soft, women instinctively sense this is a problem, because that means lack of alpha men. It expresses itself as a hatred for men.
Just like in marriage, when a husband fails to detect or react to wife's infidelity, she has contempt for him, and while she may continue to use his resources, she does not want to have his genes, because it is a genetic dead-end - his sons would likely be like him, he will pay for offspring that aren't his (thus her).
That also explains why feminists like islamists - they instinctively sense available alphas. 
Women like to be taken and ""abused"". Look how popular ""50 Shades of Gray"" is.
Men of the West are stupid, they criminalized normal male behavior, so needed for societal/cultural/civilizational continuation. This, plus commercial interests that control media (staring with barbies and princesses for little girls), that brainwash women into long years of education and then earning and spending and paying credit card interest on useless crap, making them waste their fertile years, together with islamic conquest of the West, spells doom to the West."

UgjvfeZmK5L-nngCoAEC,hugh jass,1504485344864,"have just learned about you a week ago jordan and have watched 5 lectures so far and your appearance on JRE.
