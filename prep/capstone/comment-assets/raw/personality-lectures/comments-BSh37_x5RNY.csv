UgyeTLQrXCl1fzOY2qN4AaABAg,Intraterrestrial,1528071708356,"I love these lectures... the difference here compared to when I went to my university, is that when money was involved and I was being graded, I went because I had to, not because I wanted to learn. When it's here on YT, I attend because I want to learn. It's a drastically different mindset, and I'm taking away so much more here than when I did when I went to university (not to discredit my professors, they were very good in their own right). Thanks Dr JP for posting these, you're on the front end of the next paradigm of education."

Someone else can't suffer our sufferings for us. If someone punches me in the face I'm responsible for experiencing the pain because that's just the way it is. I can't ever truly abdicate responsibility, but can only have the illusion that I am. And as far as I know that goes for everyone. This fact of life is one of the many reasons I believe the religious/psychological life (""know thyself"") is a much more valuable mode of being than the political life (""change the other"")."

Ugj2b7lSJo-I8XgCoAEC,Amit Sen,1472948511371,"I just got an image, a realisation: listening to you, watching you here on youtube, in a way is watching you unpack your representation of the world in real-time.

Aside from that, I'm very intrigued about the ""collective unconscious"", which in some sense you could attribute as ""nurtural"" inheritance, in parallel with ""natural"" (genetic) inheritance. The way you raise your children, in all its aspects (parents, environments, habits(!)), will be roughly the same as to how you were raised, and that to how your parents were raised, and so on, for thousands of years. Perhaps this is very subjective: I sometimes feel like ""nurture"" is put aside as a simple attribution; ""How well one is raised"" (whatever ""well"" would mean). But considering how incredibly many, small, subtle, little habits, like motorics/movements, intonations, facial expressions, have descended into your own from thousands of years of mimicking one's parents, I think it's a very complex aspect of one's development. And it makes it really interesting to look at ""is it nature or nurture?""-types of issues."

UggdgVvHXWont3gCoAEC,Rince wind,1472948511402,"What Nietzche said about suffering and relgion is very interesting. The christian belief of Sin gives meaning to human suffering. When something unexpected and bad has happened, the religious human asks himself why this has happened to him, and is immedeately reminded of his sins. The ideal sinless human is in truth impossible to live up to, and therefore every human is a sinner. This idea of humans being born sinners immideately seems kind of unfair, but is it really? Hitler did not think that his bad luck early in life where due to himself being a sinner. He projected the anger outward - resulting in millions of dead jews. This was of course exactly what Nietzche prophesised would happen due to secularization. Sin gives an introspective meaning to suffering, with the lack of meaning we are liable to create one, and project the suffering outside ourselves. The idea of sin is a much better way of dealing with suffering. We know that only when directing suffering inwards do we stand the possibility to grow as a human being. As far as I understand, rationalism and science can not provide us with such a subpersonality built to handle suffering. So ... I believe we are just as vunerable today as we were in the 1930s. The idea of sin might not be true .., it is an esthetic idea. Esthetics teaches us to live with elegance. Like the Elves in Tolkiens universe, that kind of life is possible, its not pure fantasy. It is a question if you understand the esthetics of life or not. In our era we do not understand the esthetics of life. We think that these esthetic guiding principles are for dreamers and naive people, but it is far from it. On the contrary, I would say that its is to clever, and demanding for people to understand. In the same way it is difficult to write a great novel - due to strict demands on the writers sense of esthetics - it is demanding to live this way. Especially when we have been brought up in a society very much opposed to it."
