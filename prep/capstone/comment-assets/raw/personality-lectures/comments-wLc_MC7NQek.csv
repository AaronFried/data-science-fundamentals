UgzD0Vvjt5vD3QTA3V94AaABAg,Simon Wiltshire,1535415990745,"I listen to you tube, lots.... too much.  Peterson I can't get enough of.  His measured coolness in the face of stupidity and name calling is my vision for how I would like to conduct myself. The comments sections of his talks give me hope that there are many who are thoughtful. An antidote to the mindless screaming identity ideology that we seem to be saturated in."
UgwBwODrmD8o5XSMp-94AaABAg,Claudia S.,1535415990757,2:15:03 not true as far as I know fish and water creatures have better eyesight than land creatures because our eyes evolved first to see under water. It could be that Jordan is just talking about land animals here but he doesn’t state that clearly.
Ugxp8QhL0buNhPCB2th4AaABAg,Alien Worthreich,1534811190770,"I observe a couple of flaws in his argumentation. One of these is the general differentiation of ""nature"" vs. ""culture"" in the sense of a ""village in the jungle"". What is the exact difference between a village and an ant-hill? Philosophy? 
The differentiations Peterson assumes (without even mentioning) are questionable. However discussion of the arguments (which all lead to the assumption of a soul vs. instinct dualism) would actually shake the basis of Petersons argumentation. And we should never forget, that society is what we make out of it and it is not a ""god-given"" axiom. In one case of a group of baboons showed a completely altered (meaning peaceful and ""egalitarian"") way of  group-behaviour after all the dominant males were wiped out in an accident. The tragic case of the poisened meat proved rather fortunate for the group as such, as the death of the most dominant males did lead to the development of less aggressive behaviour.
This points rather into the direction, that evolution (at least with certain monkeys) seems to tend to even out structures of dominance hierarchies with time. Though, not being a baboon, Peterson might not have come this far yet.
And by the way: Almost all fatal injuries caused by snake-bites were actually inflicted to humans during their intent to kill the snake - so, Dr. Peterson, please go ahead ""stompin"", as you suggest."

UgymbmJoe96RNgExi-F4AaABAg,David Hannan,1533342390965,"Fascinating lecture but...Let me make sure I understand this: People should conform to the dominant culture and compete in the dominance hierarchy in order to avoid the fate worse than death of not being alpha, characterized here by the usual '40 year old man-child' stereotype (btw does that guy really exist outside of some sort of untreated disability or mental health issue we're still primitive enough to call a 'moral failing'?). But then at the same time, JP's  'intelligent' clients living supposedly model, successful lives high up on the dominance hierarchy are tortured so much by their own tyranical minds to the point of needing therapy? 

I'm not sure how these two depictions can be contrasted so easily as they're both about  different kinds of ''losers'. If someone is rich but unhappy are they not just another kind of loser to be despised with the others? (according to the philosophy being put fwd here). 

Could it be that there are more ways to enjoy this life and find fulfilment in it than competing in a dominance hierarchy? Could it be that humans are not lobsters? Honestly I love listening to JP's lectures, and I think he's quite brilliant, but I'm beginning to notice that while his inconsistencies are rare, they can also be massive. Or am I not getting something?..."

I first thought it meant lecture 4 of 5 and therefore that the other videos (01/05, 02/05, 03/05 etc.) were missing which is very common for youtube playlists/series. Also, from a purely written accuracy perspective: ""/"" means ""or"" or mathematically a fraction, it does not mean ""and""."
Ugx6XR3BLJ4hRWzfZRZ4AaABAg,Rick D.,1530663993939,"There are no perfect symmetries, there is no pure randomness. Therefore, Robert B. Laughlin's definition of emergence, "" a collective principle of organization that gives rise to a law, a relationship of measured things that is always true but the law vanishes away into nothingness when you examine little parts to see where it came from"" requires a slight alteration, because the relationship of measured things is always true to some degree of resolution beyond which, the truthfulness begins to fluctuate and then vanish. When we measure the coastline of England, the answer will depend on the length of the ruler we use. As we move towards smaller and smaller rulers or finer and finer scales, we are moving through the fractal iterations. At some point, the length of the coastline will begin to fluctuate. This is an emergent property and it is caused by the wind and the waves, time and tide. If we imagine that the coastline of England is the hidden structure of reality, and the length of the coastline is a physical law, such as the fine-structure constant, when we take a measurement at very large scales (increments of 20 miles) the answer will not fluctuate but as we move to finer and finer scales something magical happens, the answer begins to fluctuate. This is the uncertainty that physicist are up against. The fluctuation, or lack thereof is an emergent property. Also, as we move to finer and finer scales, the concentration of energy increases. The fractal nesting of ever increasing cycles of time are related to scale.
Stasis→process→chaos.
Sameness→perception→otherness.
Symmetry→motion→difference.
Truth→communication→randomness.
The idea here is that symmetry contains no movement, no process, it is completely still. A point with no dimensions, no scale, but in terms of information it is pregnant with possibilities."

That's also why a lot of old people in my country are religious, not because they are stupid.

Hmmm...

I would really appreciate Dr. Peterson expanding his religious knowledge to Islam and discussing it in depth.

she is in bezerker mode having just slain a demon who would multiply as his blood spilled on ground. She decapitates the demon and drinks his blood to quench her blood lust.. 
to calm her rage Shiva the god of death and destruction (also her husband) lays on her path, whom she steps on and eventually calms down.
i could continue on the topic, but it would be better if you look her up and do some research on the mythology, symbolism,  and morals attached with the goddess kali and then use the story in one of your lectures.

So I get JBP's point that they aren't thinking about the den of sleeping lions and freaking out about the coming onslaught, but I disagree that discovering the future as we have is a bad thing, because we can do something about exactly the coming onslaught. 

One thing I do know about zebras is that I was at a farm that had a horse riding day, and kids mostly were getting put on horses or ponys and led around the internal perimeter of a yard. There was another adjacent yard which had open gates so there was free access to both yards. There were other horses that were not being ridden and just grazing and there was, I kid you not, a zebra. So  I had an excellent opportunity to observe.

What I was startled by was how freaked out the zebra was in comparison to the horses and ponys. This was the zebras territory, admittedly there were strange humans, but all they were doing was sitting on top of the zebra's horse buddies and not a single horse was making a fuss. But the zebra couldn't be more alarmed. It would put its head down, eat some grass, then dart off with it's head barely lifted from the ground. Stop after a few metres and eat some more, and repeat the process. There wasn't even necessarily any trigger. As in nothing in the environment had changed, the zebra just scampered away from it's stationary position as if it had been zapped by a cattle prod.

The strangest thing was even a horse would freak it out, a horse it had probably seen for weeks, at the very least the whole morning, and the horse getting near it would freak it out, even if the zebra was the one moving towards it! So even if the zebras are not freaking out non-stop because they are thinking about lions, I got to say JBP, they really are freaking out non-stop."

The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner ""desperateness"" of higher men, this eternal ""too late!"" in every sense—may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his ""going to ruin"" himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness—from what his ""business""—has laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honor, admire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived—or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt great sympathy, together with great contempt, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence—reverence for ""great men"" and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honors the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them .... And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the ""God"" was only a poor sacrificial animal! Success has always been the greatest liar—and the ""work"" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the ""work"" of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is reputed to have created it; the ""great men,"" as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars—the people then call them idealists—often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour ""faith as it is"" out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:—what a torment these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers—that they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do everything—that's a belief particular to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he finds that it rather destroys than saves!— It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that demanded love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send there those who did not want to love him—and that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is all love, all capacity for love—who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such knowledge about love—seeks death!— But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. —"

When ever Peterson talks about religion always take it with a grain of salt because he sometimes has no idea what he's talking about.

You'd think he'd actually do some research as to who Kali is and the story behind her standing on her husband Shiva. Or mention that those heads are demons she's slayed. He is only party right about her representation to be a personification of something to fear. She is there to terrify your demons and slay them! First this guy says she standing on a deity she just gave birth to, WRONG. Then says she's eating his intestines, WRONG. She just finished drinking the blood from the bodies of demons she slayed. Because she went mad with blood lust after slaying the demons and started slaying the innocent Shiva was sent and he laid on the ground and when Kali realized she was stomping all over her husband she got embarrassed and calmed down and returned to her Durga form.
She represents the dark and powerful side of women, something to worship, be afraid and respect. The demon represents the never-ending evil and that sometimes, we have to dirty ourselves to fight the evil, which in this case she took a terrible form and drank blood. Also, Shiva calming her down through trickery, shows how hard it is to bring back an enraged woman to senses."

He was killing people and Gods and the Gods [mainly the Indra and his major companions - Agni, Vayu, etc.] were unable to defeat him because he had this extraordinary ability to regenerate himself from a mere drop of his blood on Earth - hence the name. The Gods went to Parvati for help to which she inclined. That form she took was to kill that demon. All those heads, were his. She became so enraged during the battle that she became Kali - death itself in a sense. She chopped off the heads one by one of that demons multiple form and didn't let a single droplet of blood on ground. She drank it. However, by the end of the fight she lost herself to the point that Gods feared they're next and the earth will be destroyed. So they went to Shiva to ask him for help. When Shiva came to her she pinned him down as well only to instantly regain her senses that's it is her husband she is about to kill"".

Isis was not particularly associated with the underworld. It's true that she was Osiris' wife, and Osiris was king of the underworld, and so I suppose she was ""queen of the underworld"" in that sense, but it wasn't her primary association. In fact, by classical times she was much more often addressed as ""Queen of Heaven"". Going back to her origins she was a personification of the royal throne. Her name means ""throne"" and the object on her head is a representation of a throne.

Kali was often depicted with a sunken belly, but it's not because she had just given birth. She was often depicted as emaciated; it was an element of her horrific appearance. The person upon whom she steps, and in that one case whose entrails she devours, is her consort Shiva. The protrusion of her tongue is a gesture of embarrassment, when she realizes what she has done in her frenzy. In Tantric thought she represents the shakti, or energy, of Shiva, without which he is incapable of any sort of action, rendering him a corpse."

Even the Disney film followed this tradition by having the same actor voice both characters, even though they drew them to be quite distinct. The 2003 film also observed it.

NB: ""Peter Pan"" was a play before it was a novel, based on a character from an earlier novel. So the theatrical tradition is of very long-standing."

UghQF450SgAjVHgCoAEC,Catreece MacLeod,1504484835495,"This has been bothering me for awhile in your lectures - the use of the word ""chaos"" in a way that doesn't really work.

For example, on this one at 1:04:00 , the discussion turns to the idea that most people will want someone who is a bit unpredictable, but not too much so, and then you immediately move into how they don't want chaos.

The thing is, chaos is exactly what they want. Chaos isn't completely random, but rather it's structured and ordered, yet unpredictable. In the more scientific definition, it's defined by an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, or sensitive to new data, so that even tiny changes dramatically alter the outcome, but always in a way that makes sense. You may be able to partially predict sort of vaguely which direction it may go, and isolate the confines within where it could be, but you can't pin down exactly what will happen.

As such, I think it'd actually be vastly more accurate if you said that people are, in fact, actively seeking a state of chaos. They want things to make logical sense, yet they still want to be surprised. They want order, but they want freedom within the boundaries of order.

Anyway, if you use the scientific definition of chaos, the concepts you're trying to describe which rely upon the term ""chaos"" make an awful lot more sense if you don't use chaos in the way you've been using it. In fact, usually the way you describe ""order"" isn't order in the rigid sense, but order in terms of... well, chaos. The point is just that any time you bring up order and chaos, your definition of order always seems to leave you grasping for a better word for what you're trying to describe. And the word you're looking for is chaos, because it perfectly describes what you're trying to define.

While it may seem like nitpicking over terminology, it's really not. Understanding chaos as ordered and organized, yet unpredictable beyond a limited framework is immensely helpful just as a tool for thinking about very complex concepts such as the ones you cover. Randomness is not the same thing as chaos, and while they're often used interchangeably, they operate very differently to one another. This distinction is something I've come to realize is at the heart of a lot of problems within the tabletop role playing game industry for example - the failure to distinguish between chaos and random chance, and the conflation between the two, leads to designers often relying on dice, cards, or other methods of instilling randomness into given system. The problem there, is that they don't want random chance, they want to add chaos, and the failure to understand the difference between the two, presuming them to be the same thing, leads to significantly less effective gameplay cycles.

Given how you almost invariably run into issues with trying to describe what you mean once you start talking about order and chaos, it may be helpful to start thinking about chaos as a particular subset pattern of order.

Anyway, not trying to tell you how to teach your class or anything, just noticed you always seem to struggle when you get into that particular topic of order vs chaos, and I believe it may help you substantially to rethink your definition of chaos. Most of your arguments make substantially more sense when you make that change.

Otherwise, thanks for your work and uploading such so that we have access to it! Please continue to do so in the future!"

You manage to do it in a comprehensive way which helps develop a better understanding of these concepts, but at the same time you do it without asserting objectivity onto an innately subjective framework, and in doing so you apply a sense of rigor which is so painfully lacking in the psychological sciences.

I study mathematics and spend several hours a day (on weekdays mostly) studying different problems, and working towards my own perceived end-goal, and in doing that it's very easy to get into a rut of thinking within a logical framework that is too tight.
This kind of thinking often leads to severe stagnation in my work, and can be seriously demoralizing. Because of that, it's certainly helpful to take a break and focus on things that are far less logically rigorous, but that still have substance to them, and that still require some semblance of thought.

These lectures are precisely that, a good balance of thought and rigor, they're not too painfully rigorous, but at the same time there is still a great deal to think about at the end of every one.

But who knows? There is a lot in common.), and it was the single most profound experience of my life. Everything went like your conventional out-patient procedure: slowly drifting away into a deep sleep... but then I woke up inside myself. The drowsiness was gone and I was completely cognizant, but I had no control over my body. Then, after some time, came a wave of euphoria, ecstasy, and unconditional love followed by the opening of a vortex. All bodily sensation slipped away: there was no need to breathe, there was no pain, there was no fear. The only desire was to be closer to the source of this feeling, which I posited as being God. All those stories in the Bible of people singing praises for eternity at the Throne seemed painful and torturous before, but if they felt this, then it was the least that was due. The contentions of the material world? Frivolous. Lust, hunger, desire for material wealth? Nonexistent. There was only a palpable sense of love, understanding, and of going home. 

And then I came back. Everything hurt, breathing was hard. Emotion was a shallow thing in the material world; only anger and sorrow were more pronounced, and they hurt too. I'm not ashamed to say that I had to fight back tears. If babies feel this coming into the world, I understand why they scream so. If what I felt was even remotely accurate to what it's like beyond the mortal existence, then the concept of reincarnation is torturous. This life is only rich in suffering and all that is good is deafened compared to what I felt. I suppose I still see it as equivalent to a NDE, being as alien as it was. Even the most rich of dreams and the most vivid and exciting of life's moments cannot compare."

How they made it is not secret at all. 

All you do is boil and filter the product, the more you filter it, usually with a cheese cloth, the more potent the brew becomes. 

As far as transporting people to another world... that's absolutely incorrect. 

Also, Rich Strausmans' research specifically says that he NEVER found DMT in the pineal gland in the human brain. Which he autopsied 4 I believe. 

As far as I know, DMT even in large doses doesn't manifest a delirious state of mind like a Jimsonweed can. 

But instead, manifests visual, and auditory, hallucinations, particularly in the form of Egyptianized graphics. 

The big difference is the person in a delirious state truly believes and doesn't know what is happening to them. 

While the hallucination from DMT whether smokes, snorted, injected, or eatin still see's reality and can navigate their surroundings perfectly fine. But will focus highly on certain texturized things and come to the realization that those texturized things are alive and moving. 

If you look at glass, plastics, smooth surfaces, if they aren't textured, they generally don't change at all. 

If you look at curtains, carpet, light, trees, etc, the mind will create life like beings out of them. 

A shaman can help control moods with music and ceremonies with people under the influence of hallucinations. 

The shaman is the puppet master, while the people under the influence are the marionettes. 

The human body is always trying to maintain homeostasis. 

And when you introduce to much of an artificial drug such as DMT, which I believe is metabolized into Serotonin and Dopamine the brain tries to understand reality - by creating faces and finding patterns in things that aren't normally realized.

You are correct in the reports of people being ""blasted"" out of their bodies and most people DO seem to encounter the same beings. 

I believe this is because of influence and expectation the user has before taking the drug. 

And you have to some how describe your ""trip."" 

Well, most people taking DMT aren't well educated in the grammarian sense. So if you understand that along with influences and expectations, sure they are ""blasted out of their bodies."" 

I was never blasted out of my body. 

The first dose  of 700mg of CHANGA (a massive dose) I specifically seen a neon blue digitized computerized beach ball globe appear and spin clockwise above my stomach as I was laying in bed. As I watched this sphere rotate, I noticed my two closet doors turn blacker than black, and kind of like in Star Trek did a warp drive  funnel movement and become outlined with the same neon blue digitized graphics. Kind of like an etch a sketch, the neon blue formed and outlined the edge of the doors and then created inside the doors a totem pole of digitized heads that where spinning clockwise and constantly changing faces. As I watched, I begin to notice that these digitized neon blue graphics are actually little microscopic beings that are popping in and out of existence at will and creating mechanical things from their own speech and just living life however they wanted - some would created spaceships and fly around popping in and out of existence, and others cars, and others balloons, and they would pop the balloons and they would pop themselves like balloons, and come back together and turn themselves into all kinds of different mechanical like things, but all made of this neon blue light substance material. And during this time I got the sense they are talking to me telepathically suggesting to me that I too can do what they are doing. And I talked backed to them. And then it all starts to fade away like a dream. 

Other experiences are different colors in the daylight, digitized snakes, and lots of Egypitianized graphics, and even some winged-like humanoid beings which could only be described as angelic, and the barrel of monkeys that spin like a kaleidoscope of colors."

UggEiaB0dkiAFXgCoAEC,genesisofsound,1504484925727,"Great video, but I'd like to offer a little more information from my perspective. At 1:21:00, when Jordan talks about the woman afraid of slaughterhouses, he mentions that you can't live in the world unless you reconcile yourself with the horrors of it. This is true, but this does nothing to say how we should act. I say this because I haven't found any philosophical defense in favor of eating animals, in so far as you are not constrained by specific health defects(lack of a particular vitamin only found in meat), poverty, or environmental barriers. The fact is, if you are a relatively healthy person living in the first world, it is not necessary for you to eat animals to survive. Granted, it is true that animals are killed in the process for making crops, but this is mostly irrelevant when considering that most of the meat we eat is grain fed as opposed to grass fed(97%). It was also interesting that Jordan mentioned morticians and their mental health, as it made me think of the mental health of slaughterhouse workers, which are very likely to develop issues when compared to other professions. All in all, it's something that I have been struggling with in my personal life in determining how I behave, at least with regards to my eating. The standard rebuttles to veganism always seem like appeal to nature fallacies, very unconvincing."
UggTvPk9NquvkHgCoAEC,Infinite Ronin,1504484925738,So... it just struck me around the end.  Jordan talks about a noteable correlation between snakes and the evolution of human sight and brain function.

And the myth was made well before science was a thing.  So... weird coincidence?

Just a note, the glyph you depicted around 2h25m was not Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), but the Mayan interpretation of the same deity - Kukulkan. The specific glyph is taken from the city of Yaxchilan. Also, interesting that you related it to being a dragon, I guess it being a giant flying serpent that should be quite obvious, yet the archetype of the mythological dragon and Kukulkan are somewhat divergent from what I understand, which is very little. Quetzalcoatl (Kukulkan) is the 'feathered serpent', has numerous characteristics attributed to him, mostly by Western scholars reinterpreting ancient breadcrumbs, but one that stands out is the representation of fertility. A snake, duh, but also the scaly skin representing the parched earth, and then the feathers the new corn sprouts once the growing season initiates, which is also the part of the calendar associated with this deity. Corn being of course very sacred to both the Mehika (Aztec) and Maya."

at 30:00 you start talkin about what they did in russia, that was so glorious, I can learn so much from that. The evils of snitching.

I don't like how you say ""rule breakers,"" and make that a bad thing. That's contradicting what you say about the soviets and how everyone did what they said. Rules are arbitrary, it depends what the rule is. And it doesn't even matter what the rule is, what matters is right and wrong, rules are irrelevant. You can make your own rules and force other people to follow them, and then tell them they are bad because they broke your rules, that's bullshit.

You're using the word monster in the wrong way, you make it mean, ""a hateful person"" and also"" a detached person."" not being attached to your negative feelings doesn't make you a monster. Also you are saying monster is synonymous with being assertive, that's wrong. 

 on 1:58:00 that's exactly what happened to me, but my revenge is aimed at those who hurt me, and not at the innocent. But i can maybe see how it could turn into that.

YouTube seems to be up to its old tricks again. Odd that video with 14k views has only 15 comments; even more odd as when I load all comments and there are well over a hundred of them; and odd because our mutual comment thread had probably close to 40 - but it's entirely missing now when I load the page.

So I hope you see this!

In answer to your question, a fundamental difference as opposed to a difference of degree with regard to human and animal consciousness, would be like that Descartes described, where man possesses an immortal soul, while animals are souless automatons. 

Few people outside some churches would still think that that was a true and scientific distinction, but we sometimes find other more modern sounding language to express the same sentiment..."

Of course there are strong drives and urges which control our conscious actions, many or most of which are beyond our control but I think it is folly to assume that the dominance hierarchies in human society are in any way natural mirror images of those in the animal kingdom. The ability of the human mind to communicate ideas and make complex adjustments based on previous experience should surely make a simple appraisal of the human dominance hierarchies at least questionable when other factors are taken into consideration. In this respect the role of psychopathy and their cravings for power, combined with their ability to lie and a lack of conscience/empathy would undermine a straightforward view of the human dominance hierarchy.

Ugh_OLhyWiB6JHgCoAEC,Gumpkin,1504484971587,"Interesting lecture, I listened to it twice. So many questions.. so many concerns. I'll try to keep it brief and yes, this tl;dr is brief for me.

19:44 ""being able to be cruel and then not being cruel is better than not being able to be cruel.""

I like the analogy you make to martial arts philosophy. Sure, they'll teach you to kick ass.. but it's for personal growth, discipline and self-defense, not ass kicking.

1:59:41 ""You go after the unknown. You don't protect what you know, you already know what you know. You go after what you don't know, that's why you have to talk to people you don't agree with. That's why you have to talk to your enemies cause they're gonna tell you things you don't know, you can even listen to them,  it's possible they know a thing or two you don't know. But people don't like that, they just talk to people who think the same way and then they just stay stupid."" 

OK so, this string of sentences, despite lacking rhetorical polish, is vital, in my opinion. It's a pleasure to witness it being taught in college in this day and age where the concept seems all but lost on campus. For this I can't possibly thank you enough. I feel more emphasis should be placed on it regularly. Running into people who disagree with you sharpens the intellect.  As a liberal it has helped me understand and even appreciate conservatives. An eagle can't soar with only one wing, after all. To continue the fun martial arts analogies, I imagine a martial arts practitioner constantly seeking a challenge in order to improve their skill. It is in the spirit of this concept that I make criticisms of your lectures. Not to undermine your expertise but to test my ability to 
recognize holes in arguments, including my own.

2:23:01 ""I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a variety of reasons. Partly because I think it's an extreme form of cowardice."" 

lol, impartiality (something a professor ""ought"" to employ :P) is out the window with that one. I'm admittedly taken aback at hearing this phrase spill from the lips of not only a philosopher but a philosophy professor.. in the middle of a philosophy lecture.. to philosophy students. I wish you would've elaborated more on precisely why you think this way. Unless your understanding of the definition of moral relativism has been shaped by theologians, I'm struggling with why you would not only think this way but advertise it to impressionable young minds. Will our ideologically charged societies really benefit from more generations of students who view philosophical concepts through a theological lens? Meh.. I suppose I should be thankful that you're not instructing your students to be cultural marxist SJWs.

I apologize if the following comes off as rude, it's not my intention. I genuinely respect your seniority and years of study in these subjects but.. why am I not seeing any students raising hands and asking questions? Would it be too utopian to suggest that a classroom should be featuring considerably more back and forth dialogue? Would this not be even more the case in a philosophy class? Perhaps there is a structure to ""lecture"" courses which is different than regular classrooms. What I often see when I watch your lectures is an hour or two of you talking which then concludes with applause. Are these classes or TED 
talks? I'm confused.. and somewhat frightened. Hold me. Either way, thumbs up for getting me to crawl out of my escapist hole for some mental aerobics."

You've got to free yourself from what's oppressing you. You have to stand up for that. ... You've got to tell people what you're thinking. You don't have to assume you're right. That's a whole different story, because you're not. ... you can stumble towards an expression of yourself and you can listen to the other person and hope that they tell you some way that you're stupid that's useful so you can be a little less stupid in the future.""
I partially believe this, while of course this is EXTREMELY BAD advice in 98% of situations in life, or in anywhere your personal reputation is important, and you have a high chance of losing status that is important to you. I'm sure there are 100 ways to be assertive constructively, however there are 100 to the power of 100 ways to be assertive destructively, where you're lost in your own self-pity and say things you don't mean, to a person who doesn't deserve it, and they'll rationally tell you that you're wrong, and then you'll be twice as deep in the hole of resentment, because you can't control yourself, and don't understand why your emotions keep lying to you. OR the reverse, you DO find ways of making other people feel guilty, and they submit to your blame games, and you climb out of your resentment and believe your self-righteous bullshit and learn how to do that even better next time, and that seems even worse.
I'm not sure what situations you can speak out and make things better, but it probably is a trial-by-fire where you have to literally destroy 100 relationships you care about until you've learned enough ways to go wrong before you'll start doing it right. Family might be the best place to experment, or at least you can grovel later, and possibly deprocess a fight that no one understands.
Overall my advice is always start with a journal, although talking to an uninvolved friend who is UNLIKELY to agree with you might be faster learning. Then you can find a sympathetic friend if you need someone to take your side, so you'll still defend it. Talking to a person you resent really only works AFTER you no longer feel resentment and don't need the other person to change for you to feel better."
UggHVim7k-yvuHgCoAEC,aresmars2003,1504484971898,"@1:55:32 ""And once you know what hurts you, man, you can really hurt someone else. And you can do it in such a creative way, you can draw it out. You can make it excruciating. You can take people apart physically and psychologically. And you can keep them right on the edge of death so you can keep doing that endlessly. That happens a hell of a lot more than you think. It happens a lot....""
This is a very bizarre claim, although perhaps being a clinical psychologist Jordan sees things the rest of us don't see, both on the ""victim"" and ""perpetrator"" side? For me, the opposite seems true, once you see how you can hurt someone else, you try harder to not do that, even if that approach also creates a too-great sense of responsibility for the pain of others, and some pain is necessary, like when someone else isn't facing what they know they need to face, you risk becoming an enabler to help them hide what they don't want to see in themselves.
The biggest problem I'd see isn't pure victims or pure sadists, but people who are mutually lost in a dance expressing and projecting failed parental roles back and forth, or where victims are trying to ""save"" an abusive person, and the abuser usually is someone lost in an addiction cycle, and taking out ""his"" frustrations on people close to him, against his own will, when the deserved chaos comes out of that.

The heads represent demons of destructive desire that she has slain. In slaying negative desire she got out of control and her consort laid down at her feet to pacify her so she wouldn't destroy everything, including the good. She is also associated with time.

In any case, if she does have a ""terrible countenance"" it is directed towards evil and destruction of it, so she is a protector. The gods in Hindu polytheism are pretty much entirely benevolent. If you want an angry God, have to look towards Judeo-Christian stuff (including Islam). There may be other religious mythologies with this, but I'm not aware of it being in any of the other major ones (Buddism, Taoism, Shinto, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, etc.).

It also could be noted that the dragon referred to here is the European Dragon (evil but with a magical gift in blood or benefit/treasure from defeat). Very different from the typical Chinese Dragon that is a positive symbol of power and luck.

We normally do NOT celebrate someone being killed, in fact we think of it as one of the worst crimes that someone can commit. But when we kill an ""evil"" person we celebrate it, and hardly notice that killing took place. So when Symba killed Scar we cheered, because good triumphed over evil. When Osama Bin Laden was killed, we cheered, because good triumphed over evil. In other words, we are more attached to our emotions of what people represent (good and evil) then the people themselves. We don't cheer that a human life was taken, we cheer that what that life represents was taken, namely that evil was vanquished (at least momentarily). Even many pacifists cheer the death of a tyrant. It's fascinating."
