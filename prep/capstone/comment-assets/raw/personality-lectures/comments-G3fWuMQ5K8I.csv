There is more against than for you, it's a ghastly mess of pubescent trauma and end of life tragedy with, like an unhealthy high  street bought sandwich, a generally unpleasant middle filling. There is no 'happiness' you can work to achieve, it's dodging the bullet every hour of every working day. Success and happiness are the exception, not an achievable goal. Reality is dire, it's how many body-blows you can take which determines your survivability, not adopting a model when waiting for them."

UginqNjH_oy7gXgCoAEC,Kiaran Ritchie,1504484494958,This should be required material for all new parents. I think it's a shame that many parents will raise their babies with only a surface level appreciation for what the baby is going through. Anything that can help foster a deeper understanding between the baby and it's parents will pay huge dividends for both of them.

Never before have I met a professor who learned to think for himself and then share his ideas with students. You are the first professor I have ever seen being applauded at the end of a lecture and you deserve every bit of it, every lecture."

UgijRW1I98L5BngCoAEC,Unlucky Fat Guy,1504484496558,"Excellent Lecture

One question:  I've heard Dr. Peterson state that the human gestation period should be 2 years based on similarly sized animals.  Does anyone have the source for this?  From what I can find, we're on par with other animals of our size.

For example:
Chimp gestation: 240 days
Cow: 286 days
Gorillia: 257 days
Human: 270 days

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammalian_gestation_durations

The only animal I know that approaches the two year mark is the elephant which of course if far larger than a person.  I'm just wondering if this statement is accurate."

Could you allow the contribution of subtitles/closed captions? Thanks for all your work, it's very insightful"
UgjJO5-Vt2WJdXgCoAEC,MsSonya273,1504484496727,"Why are therapists, teachers, and parents, so quick to tell children and adults who are being socially excluded, ""Well, you shouldn't care what they think."" I think this is deadly advice for exactly the reasons you outline here. Is it a form of social gatekeeping?What should people do when someone is being socially excluded, ie, ""left out of the game""?"

Thank you, Dr. Peterson, for all the discussions and analyses that you share in your postings here.  Life changing for me.  

The self-authoring writing exercises were also very helpful."
UggWwBDzeUUbXHgCoAEC,Michael Chin,1472948498936,"Very good and intriguing video, but I couldn't help but notice (neuroscience background) you said that the motor areas were behind the central sulcus when discussing the aspects of the homunculus. You might have had a reverse of the two, because the motor areas are anterior to those of the somatosensory. Otherwise, a great lecture. Thank you."
Uggo7qlkg_SQWngCoAEC,Dawn Spence,1472948498955,Babies have a terrific sense of humor because they just got here and have less distance from the great cosmic joke. This world  appears hysterical to them. It is too bad that will get lost but the good news is that when you are really old and senile like I am the joke takes on renewed life. Babies and I have one hell of a good time.
Ugj9lxHpCxGwxHgCoAEC,kebabas222,1472948498980,"Dear Jordan Peterson, could you please tell which Piaget book (or books) is best to start with to read about known/unknown, knowledge building, abstraction hierarchy, equilibration?"
Ugh-RIV1BaPMlXgCoAEC,Rakim Hinds,1472948499005,"I watched your 2015 Personality Lectures and I think it's amazing how much better you get at lecturing year to year..It's almost a completely different lecture, and I really respect how much effort you put into making your lectures so captivating...especially as a college student surrounded by professors who I sense don't enjoy teaching at all and who aren't a tenth as articulate as you...I wonder how they're allowed to teach and why I'm paying so much money for it...it's funny and infuriating for me at the same time. Thank you professor Peterson."
Ugi37DfZxufMT3gCoAEC,Max Maria Wacholder,1472948499038,"We are not supposed to have a 2 year gestation period. African elephants have shorter median gestation periods than that. In fact humans have comparatively long gestation periods [see ""Metabolic hypothesis for human altriciality"", Dunsworth et al., PNAS vol. 109 no. 38]. 

You are confusing the gestation period that were required if human babies were born with the same relative brain size as other primates as compared to their adult brain size with the median gestation period of middle of the road mammals. Human babies are born with a brain less than 30% the adult size, whereas chimps or gorillas are born with 40% to 50% their adult brain size. Unfortunately I have no reference for that, can't remember where I read it."
