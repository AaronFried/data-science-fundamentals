The value in understanding this is immeasurable, especially if your primary goal is psychotherapy, or other such helping professions; even diplomacy and other such important political and military affairs! There are multiple ways of looking at the world! Literally, different ways of looking at the information; even to the idea of what information actually is, what is defined as worth being known. What you see, is determined by your fundamental values - and these values are not even close the capacity of the individual to consciously choosing their own values - it is much deeper than that; fundamental values determine perception; perception determines what you see, and values determine how you will see it. It is much deeper than this, and I can't even scratch the surface yet, but to understand this is so very helpful. Then it is a matter of learning the skills through committed discipline of more accurate communication abilities, and the ability to control ones emotional reactions in conversations that you find repugnant; because for the aforementioned reasons - because the way that you look at the world is different and how you look at the world is different; perhaps even more strange, that they way you do this, in relevance to the set of topics at hand, may be inaccurate."

But that's a good point about the simple exterior design of the computer. I just had a backup generator installed for my house, and it's exactly the same principle. It's enclosed in a smooth, regular, simple-looking housing. Open up the housing and there's a NG-powered engine with a dynamo attached; as complex-looking as any other engine. But you don't want to look at that most of the time. It also comes with an automatic transfer switch. When the utility goes down, the generator starts by itself and the switchover occurs a few seconds later. I won't have to think about it at all unless, for some reason, it doesn't happen. And then, given my home situation, things will get very complicated."

UgyhCUGiJcvRnOgeRXh4AaABAg,Catreece MacLeod,1504484953547,"Figured you'd want an update on your information - the origin of life isn't nearly the mystery you made it out to be at 52:18 after all. Like we know DNA is far too complex to have developed on its own, not just because of the DNA issue, but also because of the additional supporting structures that are required for DNA to exist, such as mitochondria and proteins, as well as being able to interact with enzymes.

RNA, however, can synthesize proteins in a way DNA can't, can interact with enzymes easily (a bit too easily one might say), and uses a much simpler sugar molecule. It's vastly, vastly more likely to occur naturally, and basically does a ton of different jobs - most of them rather poorly compared to more specialized components like DNA, but the important part is that it's able to do those tasks in the first place, even if at minimal levels.

This is why a lot of viruses and single celled organisms don't have DNA at all, only RNA.

Now, since the way RNA works to transfer genetic information within a cell means that DNA physically can't create proteins without RNA present, it means that you couldn't have just had DNA start out as the initial form of life. In fact, it's physically impossible for it to be part of the initial biogenesis process. It's not 100% guaranteed that RNA is what life would have started with, but it's excessively likely because of how it works and we already see RNA as being an integral part of how cells operate, so it'd be really weird if life started with something else then changed over to RNA, then to DNA. It makes vastly more sense for life to have started with RNA as its core genetic component.

So yeah, creating RNA is actually pretty easy, and it basically brings all its supporting structures with it as part of itself. It doesn't do a very good job of most of those other things, but it's able to do almost everything by itself. Life would almost have guaranteed started with RNA, it wouldn't have been all that difficult to do, and DNA would've formed quite a bit later on afterward, taking on a more specialized role once the other parts of single-celled life had managed to be formed independently. Basically, you're looking at a gap of at least a few million years, with the current estimate being somewhere over 750 million, between the initial biogenesis event and the advent of DNA.

What's more fun is that there were probably at least two biogenesis events on Earth, which shouldn't really be surprising once the conditions turned favourable for such. Felisa Wolfe-Simon's work on GFAJ-1 hints that there may have been an arsenic-based biogensis event, though it's been since proven that the arsenic doesn't get incorporated directly into the DNA in place of phosphorus. That doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the second genesis event, only that it's much less likely.

Anyway, sorry, kinda getting off on tangents now. The point is just that no, DNA would not have been the origin of life, and we've since stopped even considering such as a reasonable possibility. Also, even Francis Crick, the one you mention directly, is well aware that some viruses are based off of RNA alone, and that they appear more primitive and seem to be closer to the original structures used before DNA would have been created. And I say created because DNA has to be synthesized by other established parts of a cell, it wouldn't have just spontaneously formed like RNA can. So yeah, the idea of DNA just appearing out of nowhere at the origin of life is kind of absurd, which we now realize. As far as I'm aware, there is no one even trying to perform experiments to see if they can generate life with DNA from component parts spontaneously, pretty much all that research is now being done with RNA instead as the basis of the initial biogenesis event.

For more information, contact your nearest exobiologist who will have waaay more information than I do on this kind of stuff. =P"

Ugje9hFD4-muQngCoAEC,TheTygertiger,1504484963934,"What he says about seeing the snake and jumping into the air without having first gone through a real thought process is so true. I'm really scared of snakes and I tend to scream when I'm suddenly and unexpectedly seeing one. I've been known to scream in a pet shop when I turned the wrong corner and all of a sudden saw a snake in its terrarium. One time I experienced a scream and run episode where I really didn't have time to really see the snake before I reacted, just like professor Peterson explained.

I was helping some friends to move some furniture into their house. They were living upstairs and they had a storage room on ground floor where the new furniture was carried into from the moving trailer. My boyfriend and one of the guys living in the flat were carrying a sofa or something into the storage room and I was behind them telling them which way to turn etc. The other guy who lived in the flat too came walking down the stairs. He held his arm weirdly pointing forward and I remember thinking: ""Why is he holding his arm so strangely?"" Then I noticed a long blotch of light color on his arm and I can't remember which came first. Did the idea of a snake flash in my head first or did I first start screaming and then directly had the idea of a snake flash in my mind? I let out such a bloodcurdling scream that the guys had never heard anything like it and I ran back through the open door into the backyard where I stood screaming and shaking until my boyfriend came to hold me and got me to calm down enough to stop screaming. 

The guy had meant to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him with his pet snake, but that plan was foiled by my reaction. The snake was no longer than his forearm and maybe as thick as his thumb. When I started screaming and running, there were 2 guys and a sofa between me and the snake, and the distance was maybe 5-6 meters. I really couldn't see it well enough under the circumstances to know consciously that it really was a snake. I don't remember even seeing any movement which would have told me that it was a living thing on his arm. Somehow my monkey brain just recognized it as a snake and off I went."

UgiiGeOjlBO4-ngCoAEC,Johnathan Avery,1504484963974,"Paraphrase: your brain is distributed throughout your body; the experience of consciousness in the head is a recent phenomena. 

It seems as though the Buddhist/Hindu descriptions of chakras might have been an early attempt to integrate the various modes of thought (as defined by this context, thought being whatever emerges from action of the complete nervous system) into an experience of consciousness that is ""properly"" distributed. 

Maybe."

UgimNHoxixnEtngCoAEC,Katerine Anderson,1504484964028,"I think the primary reason I feel that ""me"" is in the head is because hitting my head disrupts the ""me"" easiest, compared to other parts of the body. Even a relatively low impact blow (enough to produce mild concussion or even just dizziness) disrupts or warps my experience of me and the world, consciousness basically. Whereas a similar low impact blow to, say, the leg typically only disrupts the leg. 

I've also had some trouble with sensitive nerves in my elbow, and when I have a problem there, I can feel the pain shock traveling up the arm, and when it hits the neck/head is when I black out. So if I think of ""me"" as the entity doing the perception of the world, and head is where you shut that down the EASIEST, then that's an example of how one would intuitively arrive at the ""self is in the head"" conclusion."

UggNwDk2lmdWQ3gCoAEC,Daniel Walley,1504484976844,"A note on the sense of self thing. I ended up in a position some years back where it occurred to me that what I called my ""self"", the sense of a core ""I"", was just a belief system, after which I stopped having that sensation of a concrete centre to ""me"". (Funnily, I used to feel it in my chest - I associated it with my heart and conscience (which was a learned association), and in a way the chest is also the centre of my body).

Since then I've had a pretty phenomenological ""perspective"", where I pretty much just see everything I'm experiencing as me (but also as not me, because basically I'm not really making that division much anymore, so it's seen as all one thing).

Essentially our perception of ourselves seems the same as the pattern scenario early on, where it's arbitrary which model of representation is chosen, and in an absolute sense none of them is completely true."

I wonder, because the players do not react to the gorilla walking on and chest beating, the curtain changing colour, or the player walking off, as you would expect if any or all of those things were to actually happen, doesn't that puts those events in the group of things that are 'not important, not dangerous, etc' and so can be ignored in this case because the events do not interfere with the task driven goal of the viewer?"

 I respect your work a lot, but you've been saying something that is not accurate.
You said the majority of the wealth always accumulate in the hands of a few, this is of course true when it comes to money and nominal value of assets, or when it comes to totalitarian regimes, but is definitely not true when it comes to free market capitalism (hence why so many have been lifted out of poverty in a system that more or less resembles free market capitalism).

But in a free market economy the wealth accumulated by the top is just a small fraction of the wealth outputted from them to the world.
Meaning, the top 1-10% do not own the majority of the cars, food, clothes, furniture, mobile phones, computers, etc... Those things (the wealth) is owned by the people, the top 1% only have the stocks of some of the companies producing all this wealth but not the wealth itself, and a lot of those companies are divided in shares that are owned by the people. 

I just would like to point that out, because the way you say it makes it sound completely unfair and as if there was a problem that needed solving, which is absolutely not the case, the problem has been solved and the solution is free market capitalism."

Ugi60gxp4U_GS3gCoAEC,truthseeker104,1504485000607,"Does anybody else question the validity of the Gorilla experiment? Obviously it is true within the context of the particular experiment but it doesn't represent a ""real world"" scenario in that people are watching it sitting down in a chair or whatever, so they are not physiologically primed for action and are not anticipating any threat from the environment. It makes no sense that somebody in the Jungle (say) would only be paying attention to their desired action and be oblivious to the predator creeping up on them. It would be interesting to see a more realistic version of the experiment. Also one way of validating or disproving the authenticity of the experiment would be to create something similar and then use hypnotic regression in somnambulism to ascertain whether those who didn't see the anomalous information were actually aware of it subconsciously. I just think it is a bit premature to assume that the conclusion of the experiment is valid without further investigation."
