Ugyiq2f0fRTMHppYWy54AaABAg,Flavor Of The Month,1535589193569,"As an aspiring entrepreneur, the last 20 mins of this vid has the best advice of any vid online at the moment IMO. I spent all of college trying to figure out how to create new businesses, and all of the ideas flopped. Now i work a stable job at a large corporation, but i work on my creative projects on the side. One of my flops is thousandcents.com, an online community for cryptocurrency that i wrote from scratch with PHP. I was hoping to make a large community and do that for a living. I studied business at college, but later learned web dev on the side, since i thought itd be an easy way to start a company with no startup cost. Now i work as a supervisor/full stack web dev, so i have stability, and am also learning a skill that helps me in my entreprenerial projects while at work. It took me so long to figure this all out, but peterson nails it directly in this vid. Ppl who are finding him who are young are blessed! Im 27 now so i still have much to learn from him, but its amazing a psychologist could pinpoint such an effective strategy for entrepreneurs which took me years in business and IT to discover."

The values of the relationship is the employer is saying I will use you to make lots of money and will do ANYTHING TO you, and the employee is saying I will let you for a little bit of money. Your basic premise is flawed its more than flawed it is corrupt and evil and everyone seems to believe it and those of us who don't you try to call children and stupid and wrong for not going along with your vanity and absurdity for how dare I value myself more than that to enter into this kind of agreement, the ONLY reason I do enter into some jobs is because I have the right to quit it at a moments notice and quit them I do! You see the vile govt. says that discrimination isn't tolerated in the workplace and so they use it as an excuse to take money to guard against this and instead use it as a means to oppress men and uphold lying women, homosexuals and drug addled deviants. 
All the while Yeshua has said ""what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?""
My way is better because its not MY way but his way and he hasn't failed to take care of me yet and he wont either.
I will close with this ""unless ye be converted and become as little children ye can in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven"".

You see when I was younger I looked ahead and saw a world that was ending. I read the Bible and because I DIDNT go to church I comprehended it. Nobody told me this means this and that means that so I didn't get lied to about it until AFTER I knew what the truth was. SO knowing the word I came to realize that getting insurance for my life, car, house, and getting a career for which I had to go to college for was a fools errand. So Ya I have met people like you who think their lives are so good and that people that spend their time learning of God and coming out of your system of ""BE SOMEBODY"" which is akin to be a slave. You would call me a 47 year old child but I know more than you. I see right through you and your so called methods of getting into peoples heads and its sad really. How adult is it to go along with a system that creates programs ""designed"" to prevent abuses of which they then use to perpetrate the same abuses using your tax dollars? I call that vanity and theft of funds.
When I look at you I see an empty suit, a guy that has been taught useless meaningless things that tend toward destruction rather than life, the suit is to make you seem worthy of listening to but Jesus says such people tend to be liars and thieves.
There is NO dignity in what you do other than your being humbled by it or soon will be.  I shall be exalted in my trust of the most high. ALL your work and ALL your wasted time and effort for nothing! For things that pass away and get consumed by the fire, that's got to sting! Imagine that! a 47 year old child as you say that can do so  MANY things and is really good at following Yeshua. Our forefathers I think it was Benjamin Franklin said "" Jack of all trades master of one' and then suits like you came along and twisted his words to master of NONE so that the deception could take place and people could fit into the slots the wicked assigned for them. I would rather die, chances are I shall be killed but what? Threaten me with eternity? Go ahead!
The REALLY sad thing is I clicked on this and NOTHING your saying came as a surprise to me. I already know where your going and there are no insights to be gleaned from you except self deception, so lets sit back and unpause this and watch it unfold I have some free time to waste."

My hypothesis is that there are minute bits of waste occurring in every job 24/7 and this waste can be reduced by more carefully hiring people whos personality and temperament suits a specific job rather than granting whoever ticks all the boxes, and comes accross well in an interview the job. 
Common sense tells me that an introverted person, who has sensing, judging preferences in the mbti test would certainly be more suited to a solitary job such as quality inspector etc, where an extroverted, intuitive, judging individual will by his very nature not be able to operate at such an efficiency that the ISTJ employee will in such a role. (all else the same ofcourse)
likewise, the sensing, judging type will not be suited to a creative, design type role where innovation occurs.
I'd really appreciate if anybody can help me out wit some ideas where to take my project :)

edit/ i realise mbti is meh compared to the big five, but i found those traits illustrated my point more clearly.
i plan to use 75% big five research"
UgwGTkCc7zToh9Z9nsl4AaABAg,Gubzs,1522802005902,"Extremely High Open Mindedness
Low Conscientiousness
Very Low Extroversion
Very Low Agreeableness
Extemely High neuroticism

Sounds mostly accurate. I'm not sure about agreeableness though, I don't want to be agreeable but I generally am exceptionally so because I understand that you get out of life what good you put into it. I'm a nice person unless someone makes an unreasonable demand of me, then I'm gonna start a fucking fire.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with my life because everything about the world we live in feels like it was built for someone else but I make due I guess. I'm an I.T guy and I satisfy my creative side by writing orchestral music and making mods for video games. Can't hope for much better I suppose.

We live in a world that favors two kinds of people: those who do what they're told, pour themselves fully into inane things, and who don't ask questions, and those few that defy the odds and succeed at entrepreneurial or risk-taking endeavors because statistically someone has to."

I believe that me as a  mother being  at  home especially through those adolescent year's was important. I have many examples & experiences that made me see that I made the right decision. Getting to the question, so you are basically saying that now I'm in my 40's that basically I'm doomed because I am too old now to find a suitable career for myself. Is that what you mean? I believe that's we are always trying to grow & become good people no matter our age. We are always learning & starting new adventures. Some decide to put their careers before starting a family so are they to old now?

I think it is wrong to say that science sometimes moves with giant leaps. I believe there are times when a lot of discoveries have been made ""under the radar"" or in the context of another problem so they click in with that final step and it looks like a leap or a fast development of ideas, especially in physics. There are a lot of examples were some structure or relation has been discovered and the mathematics necessary for describing it has been finished dozens of years before. To say one: the work on Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate, when people started trying to create it, it became apparent that the equation describing its behavior is analogous to the one describing solitons, so some people from the optical communication field quickly became BEC specialists. In my opinion Einstein is a bad example here. His work on relativity is overhyped and over popularized. While it is still a great feat, it by no means comes out of the blue or was done by himself, as is usually portrayed."

A partner? If I'm more Aggressive then naturally I want a Passive woman. 
And when I got my results there was no mention of politics in the summary. Since I scored very low on a category related to respect authority guess that's the Anarchist in me. 
What could be done to improve the test? 
Compare results with jobs. 
Compare results with compatible partners . Ie if I'm aggressive then a passive person is a match 
Compare employer risk. See if my results will tell an employer I'm risky to hire. 
I'd like to see a recommendation in what to fix on my test.

For example if you want to be creative, being a little happy or manic can be very helpful. It makes the mind flexible. (For me this is a laser lab, where you try to diagnose why a laser is not working properly.)

Whereas during a task that requires focussed attention but very little creativity (think of working through a difficult but well known algebra problem where one step logically follows the next), one can benefit from being somewhat angry (the frown of anger and focus are curiously similar)."

What gets in the way and becomes a barrier is our community's limited conversation and irrational belief system which would be threatened by our consciousness. For this reason we must be rendered unconscious so that we will conform. 
The appeal of Jordan is that his conversation, as brilliant as it is, is belief based, and being that it is belief based, it doesn't threaten the source of the problem, which is our beliefs. In other words. we like him because he makes us feel that we can work it out without disturbing the limitations and distortions of our traditional beliefs.

UghzAPvDjAsD83gCoAEC,Rob Longo,1504485244436,"Agreeableness

Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.

Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.

In fact, we don't fight, even though we disagree and have different worldviews. She's a Christian, school teacher, even-tempered and has never tried illicit substances; I'm a biker, pagan, excitable, and smoked my way through school.

What if a person is equal or high in both traits? How would that manifest in personality? In my profile, this is the case.

Extroversion: ""My identity is as others determine it.""

Introvert: Pursues truth through self. Finds comfort in that.
Extrovert: Pursues truth through others. Finds comfort in that.

Introvert: Others challenge self. Socializing threatens self-perception. Become psychologically defensive. Ergo socializing is mentally exhausting. Sequestration in mentally fulfilling.
Extrovert: Others validate self. Socializing aids in self-perception. Become psychologically open. Ergo socializing is mentally invigorating. Sequestration is mentally void.

Think of both the introvert's and extrovert's behaviors as their desire to 'read the book of their own lives'. The introvert can only read it alone. Others keep the book from him. The extrovert can only read it with others. Alone he cannot read the book.

Then factor in higher IQs trending with introverts (identity through self-pursuit i.e. factual substantiation) and lower IQs trending with extroversion (identity through pursuit of others i.e. social substantiation) and it makes sense. 'Self through facts' is more intelligent and can be done alone. 'Self through others' is less intelligent (tribalistic) and must be done through others.

It lends dignity to the empty coffers of provincial.  The rustic souls bat away the scepter from touching their shoulders.  They refuse to be doused with fair words and yet are in most need of them. This tireless spirit lends warmth to the brute understanding all fangs guard children.  To the whipped back, it causes us to remember how innocence hitched to curiosity can take criminal detours.  It is a forward looking language that sees what can be, but also what actually is before us.  Our self-loathing is unmasked when we hiss at political correctness.  It has the power to reverse hard damage in two generations.  We all have entered spaces turned fun houses distortions.  For this transgression political correctness has had to bare her scarlet letter.  Her captives show disdain for her.  The same ingrates she set free, turn their back on her only to wield red hot banding irons to relabel her disgrace with their former captors.  

I fully understand that some fellows are smarter than others. Life is chillingly unequal.  I get it.  However I have a deep mistrust of IQ tests.  I question how well we understand the mind and it's power to understand and advance solutions. 

The meaning behind the name ""SAT"" is complicated. According to the Kaplan website: ""Originally, SAT stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test. When the SAT test changed a few years ago, the official name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1997, the test makers announced that SAT no longer stands for anything, officially.""

They lost confidence in their own ability to predict intelligence. They lost a court case because they could not back their test up on a scientific basis. So the S.A.T. is not longer an acronym. The same way you spell sat, as in ""I sat down,"" is what their test is now. They lost right to call it an aptitude test.  Then funny thing is that people still spell it out as if it were still an acronym.  Spelling out the SAT test is like spelling S E X in front of children.  It is just a singular word."

Ugh0VhXgFXAYzHgCoAEC,Sonya Trejo,1504485253934,"IQ is not as strong a predictor of success in people who grew up poor, particularly women and nonwhite people The Right denies it, the Left says IQ is meaningless. 

As I've been listening to Dr. Peterson over the last few months, as much as I agree that the Left's viewpoint on this is both incorrect and ineffective to help just about anyone (poor people, nonwhite people, trans people especially), I wonder what disadvantaged people are supposed to do, what I'm supposed to do as one, what I'm supposed to to do help others. The Left observes the problem, conceptualizes it incorrectly, and its interventions make it worse. The Right refuses to acknowledge the problem at all. As Peterson has said when discussing Orwell, ""the Left doesn't care about the poor, they just hate the rich."" And the Right doesn't care about the poor either. I can almost here Righties say -- ""don't you know free markets are pulling people out of poverty all the time all over the globe?"" Yes, which is why I'm not an anti-capitalist. It doesn't change my observation that very high IQ nonwhite people from poor backgrounds are more likely to end up lower middle class saddled with debt, struggle with chronic mental and physical health problems,, or even end up in prison."

UggROf6GROw9vngCoAEC,Kevin Hornbuckle,1504485263592,"""Your political proclivities are very strongly influenced by your temperament."" This is a statement of directionality. Your temperament is very likely strongly influenced by the array and concentration of political proclivities that are operating upon your time and place. This observation would allow a curious person to observe that political correctness can become a vehicle for authoritarianism. An ethos which purports to protect creativity and openness but in practice has the opposite effect; such an ethos has to be explained in the context in which it actually exists - an not by the rather elastic standards of its proponents. I believe that Dr. Peterson has some very significant findings virtually sitting right in front of him. But his political pre-conceptions are preventing him from putting the final pieces of the puzzle into the places which would bring the meta picture into focus."
UgiyMLktPrqM3ngCoAEC,seandavidr,1504485263621,When people talk about Peterson vs Harris I don't think that they realize that Peterson is not only a professor but also a clinician. Peterson has more experience in helping people to have better lives. Harris is only an author and doesn't have the practical knowledge and experience that Peterson has.

UgjMQjuK7Al5pHgCoAEC,stefanl,1504485263697,"I recently did  big five test and then results turned out predictable but also surprising regarding the quantities. I'm ridiculously high in openness, like it is hard to score more (in the top 5% or more) and very low on consciousness, which causes of course causes trouble in my life and probably judged the most harsh by people around me.
I'm also doomed like Dr. Peterson described, like a 9 to 5 job in an office will in the long run literally kill me. And with literally I mean literally. I know people in my (professional) life who are happy doing their work in a company, 60+ hours a week, and I just can't do it.
I use the strategy he also described with some stable income and my own projects besides that, but that also raises the question by people of ""Why don't you just totally throw yourself into your work and make a lot of money?"". Tough I feel I need to be more risk taking and going after my passions more.
