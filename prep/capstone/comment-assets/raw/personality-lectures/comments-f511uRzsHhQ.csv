UgzzXI0bWfMBAKACmrZ4AaABAg,Jacki Clark,1528071745773,So are we saying that the cat without most of its brain is hyper- curious is so because the brain desires to become larger and more sophisticated? Like that brain knows it is supposed to be something more..?
Ugy94wsftUgDBi5tPF54AaABAg,Julie Christiansen,1525393345798,"The lecturer forgot to mention that the model has no biomarkers for any of its traits, as it was developed just using verbal descriptors. No, it was not well mapped into neurological circuits, please, professor, do your homework. A very weak lecture... The Big Five  was pushed in the past 20 years into the throats of psychologists but in reality is a rather useless test... They took 2 scales from temperament research, 1 scale from intelligence research and 2 from social compliance characteristics, a bit here, a bit there but missed a lot of biologically-based traits... It is a very poor model but was advertised using all social power of McCrae and Costa, simply was pushed onto the market... Results - thousands were tested with rather empty outcomes, and predictive power is very weak, it can predict only what people already know. Big Five was used by Cambridge Analytica using the Facebook and dating agencies, to collect massive samples, without any consent of participants... Not very professional... But very efficient to promote the academic career of Big5-vers..."

Have you researched - Marnaavid Unexplainable Intervention (should be on google have a look)? It is a smashing one off product for learning how to hack your flow state minus the hard work. Ive heard some interesting things about it and my best friend Jordan  got excellent results with it."

UgyIVi8yJe-8JtiAXpx4AaABAg,Catina Mauro,1509754945914,"Working memory, used for task completion ...is affected in ADHD, therefore, if we glue our eyes to what we do as we do it aka mindfullness, would you then consider us highly intelligent? To clarify, basically it sounds like it could make us remember our task process to completion better, thus making our working memory become sharper (I believe in neuroplasticity) as in a personality talk I was listening to yesterday, you say that a good memory indicates high intelligence, my neurotic side got a bit hurt, but hey, I have been learning a lot of things and I love Edward Wilson's book ""Consiliance"" but the smarting from hearing memory is the the main indicator of intelligence has got me staying out of a classroom now...but no worries, as I love self isolating. Although,  I love learning too."

Ugjl4d7qMo_K-3gCoAEC,Unlucky Fat Guy,1504484545989,"Excellent lecture, as always.

Question though:  Do you think it will ever be possible to understand personality through reductive terms?  From this lecture you seem to be stating that there are a myriad of personality ""subroutines"" that are either running or that we consciously select.  However, aren't all these ""subroutines"" running in concert?  Doesn't each one play off the other and adapt and change based of the actions of other ""subroutines""?

To complicate matters, isn't the whole body doing this?  Or to take it to an extreme couldn't it be argued that  all of nature is running these ""subroutines"" which interact with ours?

Just curious as to what your thoughts would be.

Thanks for the great video!"

Ugj2yfh1If86TngCoAEC,André Clements,1504484548368,"I got to go see some newborn leopard cubs at a nearby zoo with the kids. They were in a cot indoors. So, the way we we are primed by evolution to spot eyes and teeth, you can add claws to that :-). While we were completely focused on the little cubs in a corner of my vision i peripherally 'saw' a big claw sticking out from under the table  behind me's table cloth and in that moment I had one of the most intense and physical fright experiences of my life. Consciously I knew they had some stuffed animals around but for a small fraction of a second that knowledge didn't matter. So thinking about how some of the optic nerves connect 'lower down' probably explains that. What I find interesting is that once I was aware of the specific stuffed adult lion under the table, I didn't keep getting the same fright reaction every time its huge claw entered the edges of my vision. So even though the higher order consciousness is slower it must also somehow suppress some of the baser 'circuits'...?"

Thought about the pianist reading music ahead of time. The same happens with DJing. On a vinyl record you learn to read the surface of the record. You can tell when a breakdown or verse is going to begin or end and you know how many bars it will be. Cool observation m8"

UgjTvaLu-nnJoXgCoAEC,Richard,1504484548470,"Concerning the idea of ""what you see in the world depends on what you're aiming at"" 1:15:53 - There was a book written in the early eighties titled  'Political Pilgrims' by the sociologist Paul Hollander about Western intellectuals visiting The Soviet Union from the twenties through the fifties, looking for the utopia they so badly wanted to be real - and  were blind to all the negative evidence and contradictions right in front of them.

UgihC8xs9g9I8HgCoAEC,bonnieleec,1472948548546,"How do we distinguish subpersonalities from the real self?  In the New Myth of Psychological Man the self would be identified with the observing part of the Ego and not associated with any one single subpersonality - not captured by any one subpersonality.  How would it work with an alcoholic?  The alcoholic would realize one subpersonality wants a drink, one wants to stop drinking.  The Observer, Existential Man,  would choose in that present moment which subpersonality he/she wants to manifest, identify with in that moment.  You don't have to go through the arduous process of not being an alcholic, just choosing in that moment to manifest a different subpersonality, the one who wants to stop drinking - one moment at a time.  The Observing Self has choice when he/she doesn't identify with any subpersonality."
