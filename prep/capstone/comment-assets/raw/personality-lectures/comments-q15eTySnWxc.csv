Im conservative because I got to realize that seeking to have some order and routine in my life gives me a better living, and with that I can become better. 

Chaos is good when you need to find things to help you, but when those things were already found and they proved that they worked for a long time, then it makes sense to have them in your life. Take them as something to step on, then grow from it."

But on your personality test and multiple others I am 0th percentile in Conscientiousness and 85th percentile in openness with 95th percentile in intellect. Traditionally I've been very socially liberal but fiscally very conservative. Recently I've become more socially conservative(outside of politics) for rational reasons. I am completely against everything the left stands for but I have all their personality traits, except for agreeableness. I've also read studies that libertarians tend to have higher openness, lower conscienscousness and lower agreeableness. I always thought we don't want structure in the market because of our low orderliness, on top of reason and evidence of course. Or perhaps intelligence can transcend personality based pre-dispositions in political views. I value order, hierarchy, traditional family values etc. But all because I've developed those views from learning about history, economics, biology etc.  But that doesn't explain why there are people on the far right and far left who are very high IQ but there personality bias seems to overpower their reason, and their reason simply rationalizes their bias."

And we know from behavioral genetics that conscientiousness has a heritability of ~0.5, which naturally leads one to presume that some genes are involved. So if we assume that's indeed the case, and since there isn't much differences in overall conscientiousness by gender, might it be the case that some of the same genes are partially responsible for both industriousness and orderliness, but are just expressed differently depending on the gender (possibly as a result of different sex hormonal profiles)?

So I would question this study about health and consciousness, perhaps it's only relevant to Western populations and Western Culture. I would also suggest that conservatism has a lot to do with Love and Pride. You love your family (ancestors) and are proud of who you are and your family and where you come from.

I took your classes back in 2008 and a lot of this material on disgust is new to me.
I think you said that the name of the hypothesis was 'parasite stress authoritarianism' but i didn't catch the name of the theorist.

I look forward to learning this new theory on the relationship between disgust and orderliness, but right now I am interpreting your lecture through the old lens of Freud's psychosexual developmental model that grounds conscientiousness in toilet training. I'm not really sure how this new theory is different except that it seems to explain industriousness and guilt and shame as being motivated by keeping disease out of a wider social context, instead of reducing these things to early childhood socialization.

If you could provide some clarification on this new theory that would be appreciated. And if you could get some of your TAs or whoever to compile all of your insights into disgust and fivefactor model psychometrics and all of the other stuff you've been working on since Maps of Meaning and have them put all of that stuff into a book, that would be even more appreciated."
UghPt16Ym1-4oXgCoAEC,Jillian Leedy,1472948570928,"What if conscientiousness is about ideals and relationships, so without these existent in a lab setting you can't measure conscientiousness?  What if the ideal is the person's dominant hierarchy, which is why there isn't a care about the specifics of the social hierarchy or other hierarchies because their personal one is abstract, internal, and can be superimposed upon another.  An industrious person already knows why they work (their ideal) and this ideal can be superimposed upon any given structure.  So if a person believes that they are to provide for their family and this person tends to believe that money is valuable, then being an accountant is a good job to have.  Then they will be an accountant because that provides them the money to live out their ideal, which is to provide for their family.  If this person loses their job, they will do whatever it takes to find another without any care for what it is because whatever it is will be injected with or superimposed by their ideal.  The problem is that each person has a different dominant, universal ideal that they superimpose upon activity in the world?  Maybe?"

Has there been any attempt to study how long it takes people complete certain tasks? Or perhaps the methods people use to complete a task?

Perhaps it's possible for someone high in openness and low in conscientiousness to develop higher conscientiousness later on with experience? without losing too much of the openness? Pardon If I am not understanding the concept fully."

UggJ3ERY7c_4ZHgCoAEC,Hrj dc,1472948571049,"@7:00 to 7:50 High social status means high survival value but does high survival value mean high social status??

When one thinks in terms of Darwin, one concludes that high social status means high survival value and vice versa and that's perfectly reasonable. The tribal leader is tribal leader because he knows how to attack the tiger that constantly attacks the tribe or at least the tribal members perceive and think of him as the one who can, he has high survival value or they think and believe he has high survival value so he gets high status. Imagine, a tribe of say some 50 people, the one who can independently survive longest obviously has the highest survival value. When people align themselves with this individual, who has the skill and potential to survive for the longest on his own despite the impeding danger of wild beasts, harsh weather and hunger, they too increase their chances of survival thus a social hierarchy emerges and 'the one' becomes the tribal leader. (There is an another way by which one can achieve high social status in that given tribe, that is by being a tyrant, by being the tiger himself. Morality aside even through economic cost benefit analysis for long term survival,  one could easily conclude that former is a much better way to be than latter. (assuming he has no psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies))

This kind of reasoning for higher social status through the individual's survival potential seems to fall apart when applied to the modern society. An average night club comedian has more social value and status than say an average engineer who knows to build an efficient and cost effective dam or car. A Saturday night talk show host has high social status than an army veteran. A video on Solar cell fabrication on YouTube gets comparatively less views than a music video or even worst, a video on stupid pranks. What people value and what people should value under Darwinian living seems to be worlds apart. 

Water is a vital substance for survival but its cheap, diamond is costly. Man kind survived for years without diamond and they still can but without water they cannot. water is important. But just being important doesn't makes its valuable. One could say that supply and demand determines the price and value and end this here. But why should diamonds be more valuable? If diamonds had no Jewelry-kind application and value but only industrial-kind application and value. I guess, it would be just as worth and valuable as lead, maybe a little more and but that's it. Scarcity alone doesn't makes something valuable.

Supply and demand??  We have no shortage of Jokes, if I could collect all the jokes and comedies mankind has ever produced and start reading them and laughing now, I could easily laugh all the way to my death, we have enough joke and comedy repository. Now, that doesn't makes new jokes or comedies worthless, does it?

Entertainment is bigger than Engineering. Maybe that because Meta-game is larger than the game itself. So, it makes sense that diamond, with its alchemical significance, has more value than water, that politician are more important than engineers, that hollywood makes more than the health care industry.

Professor, am i correct??"
