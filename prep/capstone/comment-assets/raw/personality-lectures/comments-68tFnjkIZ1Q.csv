Ugw5-FtdxpsY7ww7VA54AaABAg,Walter Peretiatko,1525393642066,"Pain is not fundamental -- we have pain from things that are not there, e.g., pain from a missing leg.  We can ignore our pain as athletes do.  And though we can have physical and psychological pain we can also have physical and psychological pleasure. But the important thing to remember is that many of these people are romantic and prone to the affectation of the ""sickness of artists"" --  misunderstood, too sensitive, complicated, etc. -- which raises their stature in the community.  All this leaning toward the miserable in life -- nausea boredom, angst, etc. --  is mainly an act. These feelings should not be felt by people who have a high status in the community.  And if they are feeling such feeling then there are medications that can relieve them.  But most of it is just the pretense to being ""artistic"" because artists had become priests.  Once God is dead, artist are next in line of importance because of the god-like creativity.  It'[s the ""tortured artist effect"" written large!   

What would there be if there was nothing conscious?  There would be the same things as if there was conscious.  if all the people died on the planet -- no consciousness -- the CNN tower would still be there.

Reason has to be in control or else these other ""personalities,"" these ""anxieties"" take over and become habitual.  So reason has to be in control.  To become one thing, unified is a discipline of the monks.

Most people will try get rid of the pain rather than what causes it.  However, being as you define it is now a psychological entity."

Peterson explains it well, but if you're only here for Rogers and not Heidegger & phenomenology, then I suggest you use Wikipedia or another video.

UgzK3Afz9_dJ_wpX9bZ4AaABAg,Alec Losinski,1512347262719,"I like Dr. Peterson, but I find his acceptance of phenomenology disheartening. It seems the easy way out of explaining the universe without describing the underlying mechanisms. 

Eg. Why is a coke can a coke can to us? Well, it is its ""meaning"" or ""Essence."" 
justs seems a cop-out. Instead of explaining the underlying way that our brain ties concepts together to form our consciousness.

Eg. why does water have the properties of water? 
Phenomenological answer: the emergent properties come from water's essence and meaning.
scientific answer: the properties come not only from what water is made of (two hydrogens and one Oxygen) but also of how the molecule is configured such as how the molecules are oriented and how they share their electrons which change the distribution of charge on the molecule. The emergent properties are greater than their parts, yet you don't need some external substance or force to explain where they come from. 

Science does have a way to understand the world and describe our experience. It may not have a good explanation at the moment of how consciousness works, but it seems rather premature to throw science out as a possible method to explain consciousness altogether. There has been a multitude of times where people have thought it impossible to explain phenomena with science and they were later proven wrong. The hard question of consciousness is just that  ""hard"" but what we are likely missing is not the correct method, but a lack of imagination."

Ugx6pVGmY9r5juFWN1x4AaABAg,Jonathan Baxter,1509755262772,"You get non-Euclidean geometry by dropping the Euclidean axiom that parallel lines never meet. This leads to curved geometries such as Riemannian geometry.

You can see how by imagining what happens to parallel lines on the surface of a sphere. The (straight) lines through any point on the sphere are the great circles (i.e. they circumnavigate the sphere). Any other lines are not ""straight"" since they have intrinsic curvature. For example, lines of longitude are straight lines on the earth (ignoring the fact that the earth is not quite a sphere), but lines of latitude are not straight (think about the lines of latitude close to the poles: they're circles around the pole so clearly have curvature). Now, consider two parallel straight lines on the sphere. That's two  great circles. But  great circles always intersect in two antipodean points. So this is how you get non-Euclidean geometry by dropping the axiom that parallel lines must never meet.

Now, you might object that great circles are only parallel in two locations, which is correct. But an equivalent Euclidean axiom to ""parallel lines never meet"" would be ""parallel lines always remain parallel""  (perhaps - don't quote me :) ), so you can consider that the geometry on the surface of the sphere violates either the former or the latter - they're equivalent."

It seems that Peterson, when he started talking about phenomenology, fell way too quickly into some well-worn grooves in his thinking. And while his thinking was clearly influenced by Rogers, that influence is left somewhat implicit. I feel that what Rogers original positions were and the mechanisms by which Rogers influenced Peterson could have been made much more explicit.

Are they not just sharing their image of themselves, however inaccurate it may be? This question comes up when ever I try to take any personality questionnaire. I quickly notice that the whole test is predicated on the idea that I know myself to a certain degree of depth and accuracy. Do I? I may be convinced that I acted or thought a certain way while looking back retrospectively, but that in no way implies that I actually thought or acted that way.

He has an IQ around 145, believes 100% that he's a psychopath and has very convincing arguments to justify it, and yet exhibits very moral behavior and as such my compassion hasn't given up on the prospect of seeing him return to good mental health. He's desperately in need of professional help from those who know their shit (such as Peterson's) but his framework prevents him from seeking it out. I've tried to help him in the 4 years I've known him but my own nihilistic tendencies get reinforced by his and thus I find myself in chaos in the effort of trying to bring him out of his own; now I just speak my truths whether they're positive or negative, so that at least there may be truth in the middle of all this."

In the time that I have been recording my questions and attempting to find answers directly or indirectly, I have found a natural inclination to begin taking more care and pride in my personal space; previously It was seen merely as a place of sleep and storage and not much else. The point at which he mentions about organising ones room, made me smile...'The things you do every day, those are the most important things you do.' or, fix the things you do the most. Maybe I'm taking what I want from the section of this lecture and interpreting it a certain way for my own benefit, but it suggested to me that my approach to tackling issues that have up until recently, been unidentifiable, has been yielding some success. In the past I also found myself asking the question of ""What will happen if you don't engage in action?""..and he's quite right, I found that the reality within the answer creates a bigger dragon that chases you, than the one obstructing you.

I always thought that Heidegger was a bit of a Cittamatrin, the position is still ultimately flawed from a Madhyamaka point of view, as there is still something put forth as a ""model"" of reality, or what ultimately contitutes the nature of reality, or any given entity... and as soon as you put forth a model of ultimate reality, or the ""highest"" form of wisdom or something like that - your position will have flaws.

Eh, I dunno. I have problem with the notion that the fear of what will happen can motivate a person. That assumes a person is afraid to die, or afraid for their own life. It's just the inverse of the need for success (the need to not fail), and some people can only be motivated by other people, by being needed by others, by helping others. Most jobs today use the motivation of self-advancement and the fear of death or poverty to get people to do whatever they want. In that scenario, to go off on a tangent, we're actually SELECTING for people who only care about themselves, by cutting out those who are motivated by others and by the needs of others.

I think you have to understand that just because a selection process has worked so far doesn't mean we should keep follow it, that we shouldn't use our oversized brains to try to pick better things to select for."
UggaE46Ee1cHXngCoAEC,B. Wooton,1504484899284,"So the concept Jordan likes about Rogers, is the definitional difference between dialogue, discussion and debate.

Awesome distillation of a true problem America (And the other allied powers that benefited from the use of process improvement and strategic planning - which was so powerful that it was deemed a national security secret) has experienced since WWII.  We implemented strategic planning, thought of it as strategic thinking (the difference is outlined by Julia Sloan in her book Learning to think strategically) and forgot how to creatively reflect and grow through the process of dialogue.

 Are those people just different, or are they broken? And I'm not talking about the sort of person that's deranged and wants to go out and rape and eat people for fun. I'm just asking about the person that maybe feels stressed and confined by routines, and ends up making money illegally, though perhaps not by doing something that's morally wrong.
 
 And in an earlier lecture you kept using the word ""loser"" when referring to people that wouldn't be desirable mates; so is the implication that there's only one good way of looking at this and doing things, and if you aren't fitting into that mold then you're going about life the wrong way? 

 I just can't decide if you're saying that everyone should follow the mold set by the Hero's Journey, or if the implicit fact is that we're all doing that regardless of what kind of story we're involved in, be it that we're ""good"" or ""bad."""

UggEX0Uorl13sHgCoAEC,rh001YT,1504484911902,"Anyone who is bullied is in fact a wimp that attracts bullying.   I'm not just blaming the wimp, the bully is equally to blame.  In both cases one or both parents are to blame.  In almost all cases the wimp male has a father who is a wimp who is married to a woman who is a bully. The bully male has a father who is a bully married to a woman who is a wimp.  And vice versa for the female wimp and bully.  

To get over being a bullied wimp the wimp must recognize his/her wimpiness and then acknowledge how it was that one of their parents are to blame. Then to deal with the bully it is usually only necessary to say, after an episode of bullying, calmly and without emotion, ""why are you treating me unjustly"".  Any other reaction to the bully, such as anger or submission or even as Dr. Peterson suggests, documenting the bullying, is a reaction, and it is the reaction that the bully seeks and that reinforces his/her desire to continue bullying.  Non-reaction will eventually work by the bully backing off, or the bully will sort of self-destruct by abusing alcohol or drugs and then will somehow get himself fired.  Another outcome is that the bully moves on to bullying someone else who will react, which is not good for that wimp but is at least good for the wimp that learned or chose non-reaction. 

It is also necessary for the wimp to understand the the bully has been a victim of one or both parents, just as was/is the wimp, there being only a difference in polarity due to random unluckiness.  

This principal and it's solution was exemplified in the New Testament when, after being arrested by Roman police, and after Peter had reacted and sliced off the ear of one of the policmen, Jesus told Peter to stand down, and then Jesus reattached the policeman's ear. 

A similar story is that of M. Gandhi who exasperated the English colonial rulers by not reacting to their bullying....he just asked them why were they treating him unjustly and looked at them with those Gandhi eyes.  As other Indians took up Gandhi's ways the English became more exasperated.  The English preferred the violent part of the Indian revolt because they could portray those freedom fighters as criminals or insane. .   Gandhi had actually exasperated the English to such an extent that they were planning to make major concessions to ease the burden they had placed on the Indian people (whom they were bullying) when it just so happened that WW2 bankrupted England and they had to give full Independence simply because they could no longer afford the troop levels in India needed to continue the bullying."

For example, if I stand up to someone, as you suggested earlier in the talk, they may go away upset that they cannot control me, and I may go away shaking a bit from the confrontation. In such a case, any of the following are possible: 1) we both agree that we are better, 2) one agrees he/she is better and the other doesn't, 3) neither agree they are better.

I long time ago, I watched this late night documentary on BBC2 UK (when it was the Open University Channel) on a thinker who stumbled onto something, that has stuck with me for a very long time. However, I for the life of me cant remember the name of this 18th Century philosopher name, so I have not been able to look into him since. He was well off, and was dedicated to the study of Altruism. He went into this in some depth, even taking in the homeless into his house to look after them, even allowing them to take/steal things from him, until he ended up penniless. In the end as an ultimate test about God and Altruism in his work he slit his own throat believing some say to see if he would have stopped himself. That was not my interest though! He has stumbled across some phenomena about Time and the Void, that was startling to me and was something my own philosophic work had touched upon. Anyway never heard of him since and not been able to track down the documentary either. He was quite well known, I think he published some books too, but he certainly was not a main person. I think he also did some work on mathematics, maybe, from memory. If you know of this guy, or anyone else, please respond. His work is well worth it. Anyone else know of the French guy who was institutionalised from a young man who constantly made winged aircraft from his bicycle until they psychiatrically institutionalised him until he was an old man, only to find that when he was released he went straight back to making winged aircraft from his bike and rode it down the pathways again. Or what about the 1800 Guy who developed special weights and a jumping techniques that enabled him to jump rivers, which was a sport in the 1800. One day he was tested by rich lords, in which one lay on the blue spot of a full size snooker table with the boy jumping from one end to the other barefoot and putting blue chalk on the Lords nose. This was because his famous technique of river jumping was seen to have him almost jump of the middle of the lake of water! Those to last ones would make great cartoons or Disney Stories. These three names I have been searching for over 25 years."

Ugg16sFO-AwXcXgCoAEC,Dan Filimon,1504484950011,"I recently met someone whom I recently had to spend 30 minutes with and I thought was really dull. Thinking back, I guess it's because I get really anxious when the conversation isn't flowing and I don't feel like I have good ways of ""getting it back on track"".

Ugi0WPSRAPX1NHgCoAEC,Bobby Brown,1504484950070,"Nice, looking forward to the new lecture. Dr. Peterson, could you do a video talking about the Bible in regards to the typical Protestant viewpoint? I've always thought the stories in the Bible were intended to be taken literally, and was wondering what your thoughts on the Testament and how it relates to modern science, and the figure of Jesus (or the historical Jesus)."
