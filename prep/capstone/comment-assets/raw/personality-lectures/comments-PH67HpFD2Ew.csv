My generation and America in general would have benefited so immensely...I can only imagine what this country may have become by now. I wish his students could recognize the truly rare gift theyâ€™re being given, in our youth, we seldom recognize it at the time. Now, the whole world has a degree of exposure to his wisdom, if theyâ€™re willing to listen, consider and implement the choices he suggests. It really is up to each us."

I overcame that fear, rationally, but if ever I see a spider, something deep down instantly triggers a complete activation and shoving of my blood into my muscular system. It lasts 1/10th of a second, and probably activates within 20ms-45ms of seeing the spider (i.e. before I can even tell what I'm seeing consciously). Then my regular self takes over and doesn't care. Is this innate or a non-structural (non-primal) construct?"

UgxsL3IWsYzVJg0xmzh4AaABAg,Matthew Anderson,1517703684934,"Starting from 58:00 Peterson builds up to saying ""it's not 'follow your bliss'"" (58:38), a direct counter to that other modern champion of mythology and archetypes, Joseph  Campbell. From Campbell I always got the impression that ""follow your bliss"" meant pursuing what inspires you, what you enjoy working hard at, what causes you to lose track of time, etc. Sounds wonderful, if a bit new agey and idealistic.
 
And the truth is, we often don't do it.  Why? Because there are many dragons out there that confine your life to a small territory. Dragons that will devour you if you get too close. How can one follow one's bliss with all these dragons getting in the way? Suddenly following one's bliss doesn't sound so nice and warm and blissful. We can sort of do it without facing our dragons, but rather weakly. How many artists are out there who never activate the bold daring visions lying dormant within for fear of criticism, spending a life circling it from a distance, ""pursuing their bliss"", but never fully realizing it?

So in a way, the treasure the dragon guards is the bliss, or the exponential growth of it. Campbell just didn't focus on the terrifying requirement of his statement. Peterson says something like, ""no this is going to scare the crap out of you, it has to in order to wake you up to your full potential. But it's more than worth it, in fact it's necessary if you want to truly live""."

He was a great admirer of Jung and wrote beautiful novels illustrating a lot of the ideas you speak of. If not, you'd find them fascinating (if you ever need a recommendation). If so, as a fan, I'd love to hear you talk about a book like Steppenwolf or Narcissus and Goldmund.

Interesting how Peterson talks about the higher risk of  great failure in men's life, and of course gets a laugh (...). But does not bring up the flipside, that one needs to know to understand the first part: That the chance of great success is bigger for men, or more broadly viewed from an evolutionary standpoint, and this is about evolution at its core, for males than females.

This is due to males having the possibility, if very successful, to mate with a very high number of females and have many descendants in the next generation. Females have not the  same possibility for extreme success. But have also not the same risk of great failure, that is, not to get to reproduce at all... Males might win big, or lose big. Females, have not those same type of risks and rewards to nearly the same degree. 

And this affects a lot of other things for humans. Why is the bell curve for IQ pointier for women than for men? Seems to be connected, right..? 

But this is not ""polite"" to talk about. And explaining why that is properly would take some writing, more than might be suitable for a youtube comment...^^"

For about 4 years I have signed up for college and never gotten past the admission process due to my horrible habbit of running from my fears. Your videos have inspired me to push past those fears and I now am on my way to starting school in January to pursue a CS degree.

I have more things to push past but because of you, I have at least made the leap. Now to just stick the landing.

UgiqkeCJQX0ch3gCoAEC,Amy Jones,1472948488822,"I have always felt that the female initiation is childbirth.  At least, that's how I understood it as a child.  There is no need to brave yourself to hang from hooks or spend the night alone in the woods if you know that it is likely that you will experience the pain of labour.   It always seemed like an inevitable and impossible gateway to me, and it is only recently that it has become normal for a woman (in this culture) to be older or to forego the experience entirely.  I say this, but when I consider the fairytales and so on, it is often the way that the young woman has to prove herself through arduous tasks, often as the servant of a witch or similar.  Is the female initiation really sustained self sacrifice (the heroine feeds all the animals in the barn before herself and so on) and housework?  Or would the initiation point be where she conquers the witch with her cleverness (or occasionally purity) 
and goes on to fullfil her duty and then be free to seek her own fortune?  I think I will have to give this quite a lot of consideration!  Thank you for making your lectures available!  I am a housewife who would normally not have access to this level of education and I am very grateful!"

I get many archetypical ideas from these lectures that would fit right into a novel. Nature is that which gives us life, but at the same time destroys us. So why should not we do the same to it? ThatÂ´s the perfect antagonist villain, itÂ´s a noble cause to end suffering, but completed in a twisted way. A Inversion of the Buddha dharma. Even God became possessed by this archetype - he flooded the world to end all the evil and suffering. And itÂ´s quite possible that humans are doing it right now, with technology ment to make our lifes easier (causing climate change). It might seem that this archetype is not only rooted in us humans, but in nature itself. And we humans are the tragic greek hero, who means to do good but has an inherent fault causing or destined fall. It would be ironic if the world ended like a greek drama, cause ancient greece is the pillar of the modern world. It would mean that the artiststs and creative people of that civilization  (in a way) prophesied itÂ´s fall right from the beginning. That would certainly make Plato discouraged, as he saw drama, and poetics in general as a treat to the state."
