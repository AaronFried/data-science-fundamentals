UgxXihtdMWxjEZsdIaV4AaABAg,carson kik,1535415969300,"Mr Peterson, I am in the part of your lecture where you talk about industriousness and how those type of people are very good at using schedules and intern at managing there time. Personally, I find that I can manage my time quite well but I always forget about schedules; instead of a google calendar, I just use my brain. Now, this limits me to think on a week by week basis but it has worked quite well throughout my high school career. Do you think that my way of managing my time will inevitably be my downfall in post-secondary school?"

UgxAA0XReL24k-dhgfd4AaABAg,Nothing,1535415969340,"In his personality test I came up REALLY high on neuroticism, high on agreeableness, relatively low conscientiousness and highly introverted, I also come from a single parent low socioeconomic childhood and almost failed to pass high school. Somehow, despite all of this I have a high paying job (software dev), am happily married, and just bought my dream home.

Ugwxg7As9fUtSRlLiAZ4AaABAg,Antony D,1534206369361,We got our industriousness from plants
Ugz1TNMIJarMxz5yt5R4AaABAg,Baleur,1534206369364,"19:40 maybe industriousness is a random ""lucky"" mutation that happened thousands of years ago (closer to 20.000 years if we adopt the new discoveries in Göbekli Tepe, the water erosion of the Sphinx basin, and others), which in turn lead humanity to spark civilization.. Perhaps the animal kingdom doesnt have the same form of industriousness as we do, and thus they never spark a civilization, because no matter how intelligent they may be, at any ""free time"" after taking care of survival needs, they merely play or rest as this is most evolutionarily beneficial, to stay safe and rested.

But humans, we have an urge to build, to expand, to reach higher, for no other reason than because the urge exists.
Sure one might say there is a civilization-aspect of darwinism where the urge to develop civilization and technology IS beneficial for the species, thus could be included in an even longer-term overarching meta-darwinism theory, not entirely based on organic evolution but also social/technological evolution.

So its interesting to think about. I mean lets take dolphins, what if we gave dolphins arms, hands, opposable thumbs and the ability to be amphibians (survive on land, for a time). Would they use their supposedly near-human intellect to suddenly give rise to a new civilization? Or would they merely do what they already to, but on land?
My point is, the level of intelligence and the possession of tool-using limbs isnt necessarily automatically sparking civilizations.
It may be something else, a random ""spark"" in the persona of the species that is needed, such as industriousness.
Some new seratonin-trigger that has nothing to do with pure organic darwinian survival, but some random lucky mutation that leads to a reward stimuli if something ""productive"" is done, which in turn over time and in larger scales lead to civilizations.

This almost echoes some old Star Trek episodes, where you had whole species of humanoids of distant planets living like primates, but in complete bliss and happiness, without any comprehension of WHY anyone would want to explore space, develop a civilization or even build cities. Their brains simply weren't wired to comprehend those concepts or even desire them.

This is something difficult for us to imagine, because we're so fixed in our own perspective (obviously, we are what we are).
But as a random example, what if another interstellar civilization came across our planet and were absolutely gobsmacked, surprised and in complete disbelief of what we were doing.
Because, perhaps we had no expression what so ever in our entire civilization of something that THEY have always considered absolutely vital and important for their entire existence throughout millions of years, and in their own self-centered view they assumed that any other intelligent lifeform must also adhere to the same concept.

In that light, heck, perhaps industriousness is NOT needed for a civilization to start.
Perhaps, as unlikely as it seems to us, even interstellar civilizations can arise completely devoid of industriousness, due to some lucky accident in their society structure or way of being, that simply inevitably leads them to build ""up"" and explore space.
Not due to industriousness, diligence or curiosity, but just out of pure automation of striving for the survival needs of their species.
Its easy to think of an ant-hive in this example, but perhaps something with more individuality is also possible in that sense."

Since each neuron is made from multiple atoms, and each atom is made from multiple sub-atomic particles, it's impossible for there to be more neurons than sub-atomic particles.

Ugw7rAt3XWKFiSh1bQJ4AaABAg,Rick D.,1530663971527,"Cobinatorics and networks is the idea that a relatively small group of interacting agents can recombine in a surprisingly large number of ways. Space is not an empty stage and it is not an ether it is more like a nested hierarchy of action. The discrete bits are precise ratios of a quantum of action. Dimensions don't exist before action and not all dimensions are equal. This must be some kind of decision engine generating novelty with the fuel being something like the difference between harmonic regularity and self referential noise. Every engine takes advantage of a difference and we may not be able to name this difference. The big bang could be a large scale phase transition in state space. Each step in the process has some range of choices and when the choice becomes too fine grained (criticality at the edge of chaos) it is the chaos that drives the choice one way or the other. This is a random walk, the testing of state space, the measuring of value.
All value is not equal and it is the network or range of associations that controls or decides what is valuable and what is not. The result is increasing levels of sophistication. The idea that value exist in state space and must be measured and located for some purpose suggest consciousness is behind all of this activity."

So i'll say thiz,  if we take anything from which we can take something tangible it would be thiz hypotheziz.  The reazon the collegez have become breading groundz for toxic radical idiology can be related directly to the lack of intrezt young people show in college settingz to studiez where All material prezented to the student iz factual and not so much opunion bazed.  In other wordz before you Mr. Peterzon the world waz in a disarray of ignorance running a muck.  And so after your online debu4e and your explozion it feelz like the peicez are falling back into place, a connection one might make iz  that all of theze people that have latched (im holding on strong) on to you are the onez who thought college iz a waste of time, becauze they were not in college or elze they would have known about you and alzo the onez that couldnt be forced to attend and thatz a huge number.  But the reazon why they watch,lizten hear, attend read what you say itz becauze itz factuall, it can ne weighted, meazured, touched in some  way or another.  And we didnt know how much of a school setting reprezentz an official sanctuary of knowledge and thiz eliminatez all doubt of credibility and we can learn with a silent mind, focuzed.  The correlation between radical sjw pc identity politicz run amok waz one can say or hypotheziz iz when the education level of the general population fallz    xx' amont of yearz behind  what the current level of education iz in the country'z universitiez  there will be an uprize in the agrrezivnez of demandz a small group of people will be making agianzt the majority of the population and to achieve that their demandz are enforced they will demand changez to a conztitution bazed on idiology and idiology only and make claimz of irrelevance on groundz of date.  The problem ofcoarze iz the radical media will exploit theze people have them do their dirty bitting becauze thiz small group of radical individualz they themslevez are ignorant in the sciencez of modern day institution, and people like that are motivated by ego and require will not prezent proof or fact, and that manifeztz itzelf in our world with the dizrezpect of an entire population without any precedentz, like we see today.  So I believe there can be valuable information if one can extract the proper data.  Becauze after you Peterzon I realized how stupid and lazy I waz mentally and im sure im not the only one.  So next time thiz happenz make sure you tell you other not so brave collegez that it iz there moral obligation to put an end to any type of ignorance that might be poizioning the country if one of the claimz being made by a radical group  contradictz factual knowledge.

UgzHRHWQ2QYckehRdBJ4AaABAg,Integral Stanley,1530663973041,"I have been loving taking this course and wanted to share my notes in case anyone was interested. Jordan Peterson is an interesting professor of psychology. He was formerly a professor at Harvard and is now at the University of Toronto. He is unusually well accepted by many people. He obtained a grant to film two of his courses and has over one million subscribers to his YouTube channel. He gives public talks. Tickets sell for $60.00 to $100.00 each and he sells out major venues.
       Jordan tells us our personality is extremely complex. We are likely the most complex thing in the universe. We will likely never fully understand such a complex thing as ourselves and psychologists have made a good start. In this class we will study many important psychologists such as Jean Piaget, Carl Jung, Freud, and the psychologists of humanism, existentialism, and phenomenology. Although these psychologists focus on different aspects of the personality and sometimes seem to contradict each other each one is useful because they address a different part of our complex personality. 
       Transformations are best understood as learning or the results of learning. They represent a significant change in our thoughts, attitudes, behaviors and ability to live well. This course speaks directly to educators. 
This course also includes the detailed study of the big five personality traits. These traits include:
Extroversion
Agreeableness
Conscientiousness
Neuroticism
Openness to experience
       In terms of education an important point to remember is to help students and ourselves to benefit from the use of our strengths and to develop our needs."

I was born into a terrible situation, a marriage already being torn apart by a workaholoic, alcholoic, abusive, absentee father and a mother who fled with me and my sister into a religious cult. Me and my sister were raped. My mom abandoned us with my father, got a divorce and became transient only to show up into our lives to make empty promises and cause drama. We were poor. We farmed and hunted our Grandfather's land while living in a two bed camper trailer. We bought unlabeled dented cans from the super market. Before school age me and my sister would be molested by other people again. My dads brother was drunk piece of shit he would show up molest my sister start fights with my dad and usually get his head busted open. My earliest Christmas Memories were of my uncles head getting smashed through the glass door on our trailer. My dad was a harsh man and hard to get along with but he rarely beat us just yelled alot. He always used a belt even though it was metal studded. Things actually got worse after I started attending school. I was given an I.Q. test and turned out to be a genius. While all the other kids were let out to recess me and a few others were hauled into the library to complete extra assignments. I was doing 2 page book reports by second grade and read the lord of rings trilogy and Moby Dick in 5th grade. My behavioral problems started manifesting early and by sixth and I was already out of control. I was selling cigarettes and booze out of my locker by seventh grade and was in fights daily with every clique in school. I still hold the record for spending 193 days  in school supension   i.e. study hall, detention. I had tried to hit a student with an unopened can of Sprite but almost got a teacher instead. Soon my run ins with the law would start. I was hated for my intelligence and my awkwardness. Constantly being bullied at school and abused at home. I had two misdemeanors and a record before turning sixteen. I worked but couldn't keep a job for more than a year at a time. At this point I was a drunk. I ran away at seventeen 3,000 miles away and lived in a flop house with a revolving rouge's gallery of kids and misfits. We would constantly have the cops called on us. Trust me we were deserved it. A gang moved in and started bullying us. I watched as they drug my friend down the sidewalk kicking and punching him till he quit moving. We rushed him to the hospital he stayed there in ICU for five days. I was forced to ''work'' for the gang. The ''jobs were not pretty''. I still think of those people I hurt trying to save my own worthless hide. This went on for a number of years. Moving back I screwed living with my dad lost my girlfriend and ended up on my transient moms couch begging for death. I was 22. I had tried to hang myself a few years before so this time I tried overdosing pills and booze. I ended joining the military with the thought that I would be worth something to someone if I could just hold it together long enough to get killed in combat. I tried to join the infantry but after my ASVAB scores came back my recruiters would have none of that. I joined as an electronics engineer with a secret clearance. I thrived in the Army doing well at first but the strain of P.T. began tearing my body apart. I knew I could be put out if I said anything so I just ignored the pain. I eventually deployed not knowing I was about to turn the darkest corner of my life. I would be witness to several individual murders and two high body count massacres. One of those was the Hassan Fort Hood massacre. I got an honorable discharge and moved on. I worked whatever jobs I could. I ended running a afoul of a reproductive abuser who raped a baby out of me and tried to kill me more than once. I ended up in the glass house (Mental Ward) I was diagnosed schizo affective Bipolar disorder aggravated by PTSD. I was given pills and a small check and booted out onto the streets. I lived in homeless shelters and veteran programs. One night I had a flashback and broke a window on a house trying to get in looking for a radio to call for backup, backup that only existed in my mind. I caught a charge and became a felon. Nobody would hire me. I exiled myself to a shitty apartment only interacting with people through my computer for the next six years. I tried to kill myself two more times after that. Don't worry at the tender age of 35 my body is to broken to be threat to anybody. I live a lowly existence with no money and no prospects. I am the wasted potential. I am not a victim I did all this to myself through poor choices. Last year and this year I have changed all that. I reconciled with dad who quit drinking and subsequently became less of a prick.

Considering that humans are (very) social animals and that people drift without an aim to serve their communities or humanity tend to swirl into depression, could it be possible that industriousness is somehow correlated to how people are socialized or at least to their conditioned or hard-wired social lives?

Context:
I am a very asocial person by nature (I avoid crowds and social environments as if they were a threat to my life, this has brought a great deal of remorse and melancholy to me) but at the same time, I have an overwhelming capacity to admire, love, and care for people (my friends) individually and when it comes to getting work done I almost can't because I hesitate like mad until it's almost too late and my desire to do but inability to trust myself to (do) tears me apart so I spend most of the time getting to the work than the actual work itself.

My scores @understandingmyself.com:
Extraversion: High (moderately) — which, if I understand, implies at least the desire to socialize
Conscientiousness: High (moderately) — I usually know exactly what, when, and how it needs to be done, I love constructing workflows / plans.
Industriousness: Low (alarmingly!) — and this I think stems from my confliction with the desire but inability to socialize. This score completely sat me on my ass.."

It isn't true by a long shot. It is in fact true that there are more sub atomic particles within a single neuron than a neuron has connections to other neurons. Meaning that there are more sub atomic particles in your brain than there are connections between neurons in your brain alone. I believe that the original quote is that ""there are more connections in your brain than stars in the universe"" but even that is not true because chances are that there is a lot more universe out there than we actually know. To say that the number of connections is larger than the number of currently visible stars may be true...maybe."

Ugzil0KUa4QuRhxHgY14AaABAg,saracrislimalourenco,1520123193487,"More often than not, I study for exams the day before (average of 10h/day, like Prof. Jordan B Peterson mentioned... what a coincidence) and I've I graduated with an average of 16/20, which was the target I was aiming for. I work a full-time job during the day and I was having anxiety problems. I went to therapy and came up with a plan: not going to classes and studying the day before. It was the best decision I've ever made in my life.  

There are exceptions to the rule... For instance, I was pretty much clueless about math before college. Of course I had to study a bit more in order to understand differential and integral calculus. I attended zero classes of calculus because I was just way behind and felt I was wasting my time. Instead, during my vacation time (total of 2 weeks), I studied every day for an average of 4 hours/day, by myself, and got 15/20. Not bad. Finance courses usually require a day and a half of study. Logistics, 2 days. But you get the point, theoretical courses require a day of study, others may take 0.5-1 day extra, on average. (Btw, when studying for finance, logistics, accounting... I always do the math on Excel, because it's faster that way and if there's something I really dislike is wasting my time). 

So... This is probably bad advice to many people, but it worked for me. It is important to note that when I study, I really study, I don't just memorize and forget everything in a couple of days. I feel like going to classes is a waste of time. I can understand the class material in 0.5-1h at home, alone, but each lecture consumes 3h (!!) of my day. This is precious time I can spend learning other things (like listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures on YouTube...) or simply enjoying time with my family; focusing on my hobbies; relaxing; etc."

Civilization was not constructed by a ""democratic process"" with respect to personality. Those who decide our laws, who decide to divide the world into squares regulated by traffic signals, and so on are not going to be representative of the total pool of human personality. A subset of of personalities create the available niches in society since humans construct their own environment now, in other words. This would have a lot of applications - such as understanding a lot of mental illness and personality disorders, which I'm sure result at least partially and at times from environments constructed by personalities that do not provide the right niches, or only dysfunctional niches for much of the rest of the population.

There also needs to be more discussion of how the environment itself shapes and regulates personality. Nature/nurture is fully applicable here. Humans do not exist in any meaningful way apart from an environment.

UgxP5IVLmO_sqD_bAEl4AaABAg,Mark El-Deiry,1515025606345,"@19:28 - @JordanBPeterson - Professor Peterson, you state that you have been unable to find a lab measure on which industrious people do better. This relates to an observation I have recently made about myself and it seems like I've observed this same phenomenon in others - I personally am FAR more industrious when I am presented with a personally specific motivation; even more so when that motivation is emotionally significant (for instance, I am far more motivated by intellectual and philosophical challenges/discussions than I am motivated by money) to me.

I have seen this in many others as well. Give a person a task that he or she is personally motivated to complete, and that person will work tirelessly to get it done. In my observation and understanding of people, I would say that most people are motivated by a specific, personal, narrow range of subjects based on their combination of experiences, environment, and disposition.

Whereas people who normally test as more generally industrious seem to be ""driven"" or motivated by a broader, more general, impersonal interest to excel at all endeavors.

Relating that back to your difficulty with finding a lab measure for industriousness - is it possible that the variation in industriousness necessarily disappears in this artificial environment because all people are equally motivated to be as industrious as possible because they know the importance of the study?

Might it be possible to overcome this difficulty by designing a lab measure where subjects are not told that they are being tested for industriousness but are being tested for another trait or characteristic and then seeing whether their industriousness covaries more closely with their separately confirmed levels of industriousness? In fact, if my theory is correct, this might be most pronounced if people are specifically given a task to complete which does NOT personally motivate them. Those who are more industrious will remain motivated to excel because of their need to excel at all things whereas those who are less industrious are likely to be unmotivated and display that through being less industrious in doing a task they do not find motivating.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this theory and this approach to a lab measure for industriousness."
UgwYT-N3Hj9dIeM9aPl4AaABAg,Mark El-Deiry,1515025606349,"@15:01 - @JordanBPeterson - Professor Peterson, about ""orderliness"" and conservatism... has there been a study done to tease out whether orderliness tracks more closely with social conservatism than it does with political conservatism?

Personally, I am not very orderly by disposition (I swear I've started cleaning my room! AND... it has helped! Thanks for that!) and I consider myself a libertarian. Which is to say I am very socially liberal (if it doesn't affect me, do whatever you want - drugs, same-sex marriage, etc) and fairly conservative in what I believe government should control or offer to its citizens (small budget, non-interventional foreign and military policy, less controls on market forces outside of criminalizing fraud and abuse).

My suspicion - or hypothesis - is that orderliness will track more closely with social conservatism because orderly people do not want society to function differently from how it has traditionally because that is well known, well established, and ""safe.""

Has there been any study of this issue? Has there been any study of political viewpoints other than liberal and conservative?"

The number of POSSIBLE connections are greater than the number of particles ((number of neurons)! -  so with billions of neurons that number is enormous, but not reflective of real life). Basically, if a message has to get from A to D, it could go from A to B to D, or it could go from A to C to D, and with the number of neurons in a brain, it is pretty much guaranteed that the paths taken by the same message in two different brains won't be the same, because there are more possible paths it can take than particles in the universe (assuming the brains are identical, which brains never are).

TL;DR, Everyone has a unique brain that processes info differently.

And I'ts not that I did not suspect that something is not quite right with me because my life is a neverending sequence of wasted oportunities, failures, bad choices and so on. Messed up my education as well.  Good things are never a result of my work but just pure coincidence. Probably I'm quite intelligent, I can learn really fast, I promote quickly in every job that I have so I can mess it up because I'm probably not suited for managing people and most of all managing my own time at work.
Relationships? Give me a break. One friend and total disaster when it comes to establishing long therm relationship with a woman if any at all.
It's like I'm starting to feel that ending my life is less troublesome than living like this for next 30 years."

P.S. To the students arriving late: shame on you. 
You have the highest advantage in life to be there, in person, looking forward to a brilliant career, elevated comprehension of life, high income, and extraordinary education all given also thanks to this extraordinary person. You really have no idea how good you have it.

UgwI4keFHITpEUPBpPB4AaABAg,Anon Truth,1512347216241,"searching for Gerald Edelman, as suggested,  leads me down the rabbit hole of Edelman's lectures on concepts of consciousness, Jamesian properties of consciousness, and neurophilosophy. In light of this focus on consciousness and it's relation to psychopathy, the idea of the anterior insular cortex being a critical piece to the puzzle that is consciousness is fascinating; especially considering the AIC's connection to the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Jeez and I am only two minutes into the lecture. Thank you professor Peterson this is great information.

I found this man's videos from a forum or blog website and was hooked when I started listening to his motivational speeches. I am hoping to learn about myself and others a bit more so that I can lose this severe social anxiety.

""The complete hardcover version of the textbook can be bought used (the actual textbook is a selection of readings from this book).

But perhaps more valuable is that you can you can find pdfs of many readings on the course website (the URL at the beginning of this video is out of date, but you can find it on JPs website under courses, psych 230).

There's about 70 sextillion stars in the  observable universe, our brain has a mere 100 trillion synapses, now for the unobservable universe, we have no idea, and each star contain a huge number of atoms, which in turn each contain some subatomic particles.

Ugh_yW7ED5oprHgCoAEC,Matt Varela,1504484853089,"01. Introduction

- change in personality is commonly known as learning …factual learning and how to perceive and behave

- clinical psychologist of the first half of the course
        - the nature of the implicit structures that shape your perceptions
        - the implicit structures that shape your behaviours and how they are integrated in relationship to your negative emotions, health and wellbeing
-  thinkers of the second half
        - laying out the structure elements of those features (negative emotions, health and wellbeing) and relating them to the underlying mechanistic phenomena …this is making the assumption that there is a relationship between your personality and the manner in which your brain functions.

- metanarrative to learn …knowledge is not memorisation, but creating a cognitive structure that enables you to better conduct yourself more properly in life.

- wisdom …your capacity to understand yourself 
        - so that you don’t find too much of a intolerable mystery of what you constitute
        - to understand others and being able to predict their behaviour, understand their motivations, negotiate with them, listen to them and formulate joined games with them so that you can integrate reasonably well with another individual or group.

- big five trait personalities …implicit structures that govern your perception
        - happiness/extroversion
        - neuroticism …related to composed negative emotions  (anxiety, sadness, depression, etc.)
        - agreeableness …polite, noncompetitive, cooperative, self sacrificing for others, compassionate people that doesn’t like conflict (women score highly across cultures)
        - conscientiousness …diligent, industrious, orderly people (orderliness is associated with disgust)
        - openness …creative, intelligent people that welcome new information and are interested in aesthetics, fiction, arts in general.

- personality is not necessary inside you, humans are a multilevel being “is your mother more a part of you than your arm?”"

In order to learn to speak English like native speakers I must learn to think in English before. The technique for that is very simple. When I'm walking in the street I should begin to think in English without translating my thoughts in Russian. How can I achieve that? Well, I must start with a simple sentence like that: ""I want to think in English"". Then, if nothing comes to my head, I must repeat the sentence. I must repeat the sentence while some other sentence will come to my head It may be something like that: ""I want to think in English but how can I do it? I know some words and I can connect the words to each other. What words do I know..?

2. 
Every day I can begin with the sentence: I want to think in English. I have to imagine a way of the thinking process in which I could go in different possible directions for some minutes. Every good step that I will make will be noted as a new level in the game. For example, the first point is: I want to think in English. The second may be: everything, what I need for thinking, is time. How much time can I spend for this kind of thinking per day? It's a good question. If I want to get a good result it must be one or two hours at least. How can i organize it? How much time do I spend for the internet every day? If I could use half of this time for thinking, I would get enough.

3.
I want to think in English. Where would I come today? Where would I come in a month? In a year? If I think every day trying to write down the process of thinking and focusing on some issue within a month, I will be able to figure out what thinking in English is like. If I concentrate on the issue during a year, I will be able to use English in the process of thinking without efforts. What prospects does it offer? I will be able to listen to everything that I can find on the internet in English. It is the same with reading. Also I will be able to write. It gives me an opportunity to communicate with everyone I want. I can master thinking everywhere. Every free five minutes I can get to it."

We are now several generations og children sacrificed on the altar of industrial production and growth (money as the ultimate good!). We have turned our women/mothers into industrial slaves (liberation!?), valuing material goods over essential family values and the emotional health and well being of the next generation (rebirth). We are truly living in the corpse of the dead culture. The narcissist generation of Baby Boomers, most of whom should never have had kids, since they didn't bother to take care of us (emotionally), instead buying us off with toys, while not bothering to spend any time with us, teach us anything in life (the job of institutions!?) or even listen to us. Treating us as a nuisance to be fed and put in front of the TV or computer and then in bed.

Most ppl I know in my own and following generations) are completely lost and broken in so many ways. We are unprepared for and unable to live our lives, just barely staying afloat. The older generations have hoarded all the ""real estate"", leaving nothing for us to start our own lives.  We are rapidly descending into utter chaos, Collapse of civilisation once more, a new Dark age.
Don't mess with mother nature!

Through these courses I'm finally able to resolve and understand a lot of things about myself, my family, upbringing and all the loss and pain I felt throughout all my life. Most of my friends are in a similar situation, having been abandoned to institutions (the grand experiment!), being completely alienated (or hostile) to their own family. 

My parents could only talk down to me and criticise everything I did, to the point I just felt like giving up and not even try. 
Fucking bastards. I often wished they would die, sooner than later. A sad state of affairs! 

Time to reclaim myself, my soul, health and personality - face the chaos, captain hook and escape from this prison of the mind.
These courses give me courage even though they make me cry...!

Thank you."

Uggro3p6PNUHsXgCoAEC,texas,1504484926133,professor Peterson I know this may not be the subject of discussion in this video but like to know your take on the Khmer rouge experiences. It played out parallel to your warnings of leftists ideology. Pol Pot studied second handed communism from French leftists in france then returned to Cambodia. The hell he unlashed on unsuspected Cambodians was a total destruction. Pol pot actively seek to destroy thousand of years of Cambodian antiquity murdered educated non communist to erase the past

Working toward a specific goal  like a product or personal way to be interesting and useful somehow later.

Ugi2fIWHnL4t9ngCoAEC,Sergei Kenny,1504484944625,"Dear Jordan, Interesting comments on victimisation, Ukrainians and genocide. It appears that now they are now committing genocide in the Eastern Ukraine? I understand that living in Canada with many millions of Ukrainians whose ancestors were collaborators during the WW2 and therefore have some bitterness and resentfulness towards the USSR. I have not researched the topic of 6,000,000 dead during Golodomor but it appears that there is some evidence that the cause of death was not hunger but some sort of epidemics. Example of Leningrad comes to mind. The German siege of Leningrad lasted 900 days from September, 1941 to January, 1944. During that time 800,000 people, nearly a third of the population at the siege's beginning, starved to death. Roughly one in three. That is in a city! I was born in Belarus and it would be impossible to starve during the summer!!! Stinging nettles soup and other vegetables would be available no problem. This is something for you to investigate and agree or not. You sound like Goebbels and a hate preacher when you talk about the Russians which is not very professional. I would love to engage in discussion with you as I have great respect for you and your lectures are really good. Kind regards, Sergei P.S. Kulak - means a fist in russian to have that idea of grabbing from the poor. It could well be that those guys were sent to Siberia to actually develop it not to die. If you notice now Putin spends much effort to develop Siberia and even gives away the land for free! In my opinion kulaks were a necessary sacrifice. My ex-partner-mother-of-my son is a granddaughter of kulaks. The story is that they lived an amazingly prosperous life in Siberia. Taiga with animals, berries and mushrooms gave plenty. And please don't think that it is always -40C there. Summers are shot but quite warm."

UgjvEJtDaYdKd3gCoAEC,Ace of Goats,1504484944710,"I just want to pass on my respect to all of the students of Peterson who are there with respect to his teachings. The battle Peterson is engaged in is one in defence of the dream that began with Plato; an idea that people can aim towards enlightenment, not through conquest and oppression, but through pontification and debate. 
So to those who simply learn from Peterson, I offer you my support. Agree or argue. Do not support any form of oppression."

What are your views on DMT in the human body and it's relation to the Pineal Gland? I'm sure you are aware of Rabbi Joel Bakst and his breakthrough on the subject. Basically this is the source of all true spirituality. If this is true this could change the world!  In his books he claims for factual basis that cannot be debunked... Please help me make sense of this I can't stop thinking about it. I couldn't find a video where you talk about this."
