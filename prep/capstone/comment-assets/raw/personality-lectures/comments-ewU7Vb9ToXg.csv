UgyTezkHug_xpGYF5GZ4AaABAg,Michael Tevet,1533342517720,"Dr petersons explanation of the Apprehension of a reward being more powerful of an emotion than the actual acquisition of the reward reminds me of a fantastic quote from Mr. Spock ; ""Having is not always as pleasurable a thing as Wanting"".  

Maybe (in terms of life goals) it's actually important that the idea is more exciting than the completion, so that more goals are continually set. This is the Sisyphus journey he was talking about in this video but combine that with the dopaminurgic systems he explains in other videos and you have a reliable system to keep you on track. 

So how come people completing their goals constantly? I'm trying to get better at this but I let my hypothalamus dominate me through distractions all the time. Sometime I realise I'm doing it, most times I don't."

UgzYqrxTtlgxRnmFoKp4AaABAg,Lange Voelspriet,1530664117767,"I'm extremely high in openess to experience, extremely low in agreeableness, extremely low in concientiousness, extremely high in intelect, low in neuroticism, average in compassion, but not very average in comparison to the average joe.

I might have been viewed by many people in my surroundings like I'm a piece of useless garbage, and one who talks back too, but at least they didn't b(reak) my spirit. 

I've had a shit life. My brother(who you could describe as a 3 year older than me bisexual hipster who is possibly becoming a transgender) never actively played with me unless it were games of domination like wresteling -which I won ever since I as 13 and those wrestling matches never happened again since then-, never liked me or ever played with me as a kid. I was playing by myself outside whilst he was doing whatever. I never could convince him. he was acting like a mean dog those days. Confused about his sexuality at the age of 8 or something. fucking wipe.

By the time I was 12 my dad, who always made sure I arrived at school and always came to pick me up (we rode bikes) and owns private a library of 25 thousand books, had a series of medical life threatening problems. To make a long story short, the next 3 years he died 4 times, only to be resurrected by doctors and surgeons who were more often than not the cause of my fathers initial dying. today he still walks around, in agonising pain every day, without one half of his hart, without the muscles in his belly, a lot of scars, and pain in his bones.

when I was 13 years old, I went to the big boys' school. My brother had just left this one as he is 3 years older than me. The kids and teachers remembered him thourougly. I proceeded to instantly attract the biggest bully in town to come and fight me. I was never the kid to shut up when attacked. So after the first few incidents when this bully would come with his friends to me and my newfound group of weaklings and try to intimidate, surround my, hit me or kick me whilst the weaklings would watch and do nothing, and where I would refuse to back down, I managed to claim the weakling throne and thrive. As the months passed and winter came, I was surprised to notice that all the other kids my age in other classes wouldn't talk to me because they were scared they would be bullied too. 

In the middle of winter, shortly after my birthday my dad was at it again. hospitalised, at the brink of death, the usual. As the kids in school would ""fight"" mental battles of dominance to establish an acceptable hierarchy, I was a bit lost since, you know my dad and stuff. My mother was working 5 days a week, traveling to our capital Brussels to do her job, so you can imagine she couldn't spare much time or energy to her sons. She had trouble enough fixing us a hot plate everyday since that was my dads job. I was wearing this old coat from one of my many older nephews to school, rocking a unibrow and as you can imagine, this caused some stiring in the social pot. As for my physical capabilities, I was and still am, a little bit of and ubermensh if you don't mind me calling myself that. I won several sportsmedals in school. My adversaries couldn't be bothered. 

There was this game at school, when one one guy would throw a red coin in the air and yell ""Schooierfight"" which more or less translates to ""Hobofight"" No need to mention I was a pro. In fact, I won so many times, people started getting pissed off at me. The next time I went to play in a little football team at school, this one guy had made up a chant about me. he, and about 200 other kids would ever since then chant: Sander the schooier! du du, du du du, Sander de schooier! du du, du du du.
Which of course was an obvious reference to my silly clothing and poor look, aswell as the game I always won. The teachers wouldn't even try to protect me or try to stop the other kids, but that was probably because they didn't understand what was going on. I never sought help anyway.
 They kept doing that on and of for 2 years, but I refused to go to another school, even though the teachers, who couldn't stand me either as you can imagine where eager to convince my mother I was a morron who had to leave their school. Can you believe it? Only thanks to my father coming to my school once when he was in a better state, I was left the option of proceeding to my third year. He actually threatened some old woman responsible for the school with his cane at some point.

Now this is only a short summary of my life to the point of being 15 years old, and even though I haven't covered the remaining 5 years to describe the utter shitness of my I'm quite sure it isn't nescerary anyway. I think I made my point already.

Life is a piece of shit, and when somebody tries to fuck you in the ass, you have to be merciless and fight back, for if you don't their shit will only start to smell worse, and other people will start dumping their shit right in your face because you're the easy target. Humans and apes, all like their shit flinged to their adversaries."

The issue I have with your point of a distributed ""being"" throughout the nervous system is that the brain alone is what holds the ""being"", one's self. You have been talking in this and the previous lecture about seeing and walking with our spines and I have no reason to doubt the validity of your claims even though I am not a biologist. However, you are talking about sensory ""awareness"" of our bodies (similar to triggering hunger for example) which is not the same as being conscious or alive. A severed limb or spinal cord does not remove one's self even though this condition may ""imprison"" him within his body. All memories and personality traits are stored and manifested by the brain. If the brain dies, the person dies and disappears regardless if the heart or spine remain functional. A transplant would not make me another person; so will not a head transplant. In the latter, I would simply change a body and I would not have access to any personality traits nor experience of the person whom I received the body from. And lastly, a blind person may be able to see because the nervous system is extremely plastic and this is the reason why, most probably, we can learn virtually everything. As always, I love to listen to you and your lectures. Keep up the good work Dr!"

Where by - A small mistake gets applied at the highest level of meaning... 
i did something a ‘good person’ wouldn’t do…therefore, i MUST be a horrible person.

 Although I’ve never been clinically depressed as such, I can see how, taken to an extreme this way of thinking can emotionally dismember a persons life.

""i did something a loving person wouldn’t do… therefore i am unworthy of love.""
'i did something a person in love wouldn’t do… therefore, i am not in love.'
'i did something a ‘good person’ wouldn’t do… therefore i deserve to die.'

Depressed people can be hyper sensitive to perceived criticism - which is I suppose an extension of this over generalization onto ‘the other’.  
Where a small comment / gesture / behavior’ is construed to mean they don’t love me.

So, on the topic of alcoholism.
My family has a history of at least having fun while drinking.
My dad only needs a little push in order to become an alcoholic.
And I experience a clear dopamine burst when drinking.

However, I can't voluntarily get drunk.
This became clear to me when drinking half a bottle of wine once.
While I got close to being drunk, it wasn't that at all.
I was still able to control myself, kept memories, and didn't even have a hangover. (it was gone after a few hours, including aftermath)

But what I found was that the more I drink, the less I feel the desire to drink.
And after that wine incident I've been drinking so little that after nearly a year, I'm still on the same bottle as I opened shortly before that. (two types of wine)
I can only recall one glass of wine since then as well.

With beer (what I drink pretty much only now) it's quite the funny story as well.
Because I cut down the amount of cans (just the 0%, though) after constantly forgetting that I could still get one that day. (this also being the case for the actual ones)
Even now I constantly forget that I can get one despite drinking just four cans in a week. (reminds me, I can still get one today)

UghzJA3y7fpoZngCoAEC,Alex Zhulin,1504484991249,"I don’t quite get the connection between low extraversion and distaste for social gatherings introverts generally have. Is it that their incentive reward system does not give them enough reason to override underlying exploratory system? And they view socialization as a distraction from whatever activity they'd rather do to actually get from point A to point B on Jordan's diagram? 

For example. Highly agreeable neurotic introvert comes into a bar. She (or he) wants to be liked, and to do that she feels like she need to match other people level of excitement. But she cant do that - her reward system is not up to the task. She freaks out and feels completely paralyzed. 

And that's why a general image of a high status introvert is a cold-hearted asshole - like professor Snape from Harry Potter. Low extraversion, low neuroticism and low agreeableness. Is that correct?"

Ugj1Ptk_6o7yIXgCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485003785,Keen observation of women's negative emotions linked with childbearing.  One half of teaching children is punitive.  Believe it or not their threat assessment comprehension leads that of men's.  Men act one their threat assessment quickly and more definitively.  However a good deal of quarreling between man and wife is over assigning malevolence to potential friends and acquaintances.  Men tend to be more generous in assuming innocence.  Women are welcoming but with but have layered tests of threat potential that get carried out during many meetings.  Men are more one and done.
UgieRYaiYC21Q3gCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485003796,"Peterson scores with the parallel of emotion pain to physical pain.  Emotional pain shares similar neural pathways with physical pain.  You can literally take an aspirin for a broken heart.  It will really reduce your emotional response, no joke.  It is not marvel, painful confessions or sinful disclosures can reduce stubborn body aches and pains. 

Self-preservation is a proof of evolution?  Huh?  You know what else is proof of evolution?  Your feet are not where your head is positioned and your head is not where your feet are located.   I mean design could account for that but let's just cram in the round postulation of evolution that square peg of justification.

I am so underwhelmed with these dubious evolutionary tests.  If I throw a punch to your face stopping one inch from hitting you, you will flinch.  Now is that because you have a sixty million year fear of disembodied fists as an ape in a tree?  It's called A REFLEX RESPONSE!  It's so funny because Christians get accused of erecting the God of the gaps.   Whenever there is a question that science can not answer, stuff God in there, right?  It seems this exact way with evolution.  Anytime there is something that hints of novelty, just slap evolution on it and call it good. 

This is why Christians call evolution a religion.  It is not falsifiable.  There is always an excuse to overthrow contrary evidence in favor of evolution.  For kiddies who don't know what it means to be falsifiable, it means having the character of a belief that is able to be proven wrong.  Not that it has to BE wrong, but it must have a criterion by which it can be shown to be correct or  incorrect. 

For example emotions are not falsifiable.  You can't prove that someone's anger is correct.  There is not such thing as wrong anger.  Anger is anger.  Some may speak of justifiable anger but even that is arbitrary.  Emotions are not subject to being disproved.   Art is not falsifiable.  Is the Mona Lisa right or wrong? That is not even the right question.  To ask that question is to misunderstand art in the first place.   Now math is falsifiable.  It operates on the principle of equality and balance.  Two plus two equals four.  This can be proven true or false. 

  However  REAL SCIENCE, is falsifiable.  For example you may get blood work that was done poorly and get bad results, but then follow up tests that are more stringent show a different diagnosis negating the validity of the first one."
