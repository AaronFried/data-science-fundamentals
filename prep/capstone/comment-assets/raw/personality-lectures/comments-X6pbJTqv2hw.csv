UgyQ6iAPdzQLmxqyuuV4AaABAg,David Ewing,1533342430975,"Wow I just had an amazing realization in regards to Simba transforming into and subsequently transcending his father. He felt guilty and responsible for his father's death, and he was carrying that metaphorical weight. When he first has the transcendental experience seeing his father in the pool, he becomes conscious of his own short comings and vulnerabilities. After this experience he has accepted his responsibility and in essence picked up the metaphorical weight of his consciousness. When he confronts Scar and finds himself in his father's position near death, Scar's revelation that he was responsible for Mufasa's death takes the metaphorical weight of guilt Simba had, off his shoulders. The letting go of that guilt gives Simba the strength to overthrow the tyrant. 

In summary, we must accept responsibility, and lift our burdens of life. When you lift your load that life throws on you, you will learn we may be we are carrying around more than necessary, and we will become stronger when we allow ourselves to let go of the unnecessary burdens."

He said Mufasa overlooks the threat of Scar / his own dark side but it seems more like its not a lack of awareness of his malevolence but just a total confidence in his own ability to deal with Scar at any given moment, which perhaps speaks to our own overconfidence of being hero material, our irrational tendency to feel like we have the strength to not be swept up in something like a Nazi movement, so I'd be interested in his comment on that, and 2. He said that he feels like it's almost cheating to use this film to analyze Jungian archetypes because the writers were consciously aware of the archetypes, like archetypes should be subconsciously produced and if not they are somehow disauthenticated, but I don't quite understand this ‚Äìwhy would archetypes be less authentic if consciously produced?"

Even though when I started, I had the feeling that's what the questions are engineered to do: I can't get past the fact that I'm wasting my time being thoughtful in answering each simple question/exploration only to have it asked again with a slight change in wording and imposition-- as though I hadn't already considered those options when carefully considering what to write the first time.  

It makes me so irrationally furious, literally furious; mind blank with a bright rage, that I've quit each of the programs before getting past much farther than the 4th input box.  I'm getting worked up and angry just typing about it.

Responsibility is all nice, but theres got to be a payoff. Simba has no reason to grow up nor responsibility towards the silly kingdom. There was no threat to his paradise - not even hypothetical one. Thats why not growing up and living like he had was a perfectly reasonable and correct choice. He had no reason to give a damn about some bunch of lions or zebras or trees and stuff. Obviously you will go there to forward an amazing analogy helpful to the lecture itself, but the premise is wrong. There is no worth in taking responsibilities for no reason.

The idea of being in the desert for 40 years (bear in mind Israel and ¬†Egypt are quite close!) is that to go from slavery (bound to the enslaving old institution) and to free the mind to renew the new rule of law in freedom, a long internal journey, without ""words""/materialistic ""things"" (devarim) is needed which the desert (midbar) gives. ¬†The journey of the lion cub after the death of the father - the complexity in the story- might be about getting to freedom, releasing from mental slavery that the mind‚Äã tricks of the evil Uncle created...."

Is it so bad to live in that framework, and do you really think being carefree and impulsive has no point and use in life? To me it sounded for a moment like Mr. Peterson's shadow is talking there a bit. I am all for ""knowing thyself"" but I have to admit impulsiveness and living for the moment also have their ""use"".

Its why single motherhood is so problematic at the moment and will continue to be until women start taking some more responsibility as to when and who they have decide to have children with. Its very easy to just blame men and obsolve themselves from personal responsibility but it comes at much too high a cost. Its why women must be held just as accountable¬† as well, which is evidently nowhere near the case as the state just propogates the supposed values of single motherhood as a just and virtuous cost when the statistics show quite the contrary with regards¬† to the children's proclivity to lead a productive and fulfilling life."

Try and find a part of Hitler's writings that talk about any other non-aryan with disgust.
Yeah, Zyklon B was used for fumigating pests. It wasn't used on humans. There's no evidence that it ever was used on humans. The holoHOAX is an utter myth used to propagate the zionist state of Israel as well as ensure ZOG's of the world to be immune from criticism. 
Yes, it was compassion to utilize the eugenics projects as well as euthanize the retarded and the psychotics. How could it be argued that the existence of such dregs on society be preferable for the foreseeable future rather than to cull them at once?

I don't believe this means the Masais were psychopaths, it's just their culture is so inherently different than ours.

No one knows why. No one knows why we don‚Äôt give synthetic GABA(neurontin) to easy symptoms.  Alcohol, for these people, IS their GABA, now. 

Also, they start around 3 days after last drink. No one knows why.  Every other drug, withdrawal symptoms start when the drug leaves the system.

The non stop physical exertion during detox, is unbelievable.  They do not stop moving and struggling during the whole detox experience.

And you are really right, many after 2 weeks of lorazepam drips and being on a vent, they leave the hospital and go and get a bottle of vodka and start all over again.

I don‚Äôt know how much Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) there is in the human body. But it has to be about equivalent or roughly about.

""Abstract
In this essay, I am going to discuss the concept of collective memory as a background for understanding Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious only makes sense in the context of some notion of collective memory. This then takes us into a very wide-ranging examination of the nature and principle of memory-not just in human beings and not just in the animal kingdom; not even just in the realm of life-but in the universe as a whole. Such an encompassing perspective is part of a very profound paradigm shift that is taking place in science: the shift from the mechanistic to an evolutionary and wholistic world view."""

UghsOcmNXBrKJngCoAEC,AnotherLover,1504485022241,"The answer to the question at about 1:28:00 that Jordan relates from a former student is quite revealing.  It deserves a book of it's own, methinks.  The question was ""Why do we need the stories?  Can't we just tell each other the archetypes instead?""  That's an interesting question.  It's the type of question you real quick throw out an answer to because it makes sense intuitively that the archetypes themselves are too abstract and the story represents them better than the abstract form.  That's so strange, though.  Isn't it?

It shows us how disconnected we are from abstract ideas.  We think abstractly so often that we think we're pretty good at it.  But in fact, I think, that only appears to be the case because we are thinking abstractly on subjects we know very well.  So those things carry their own stories with them.  We don't know them only abstractly, nor through a simple story, but through life itself, which represents itself to us as a story within our minds.  We don't live abstractly, we live the story.  The abstract is real, but it's not as real as the story, which itself isn't as real as reality.  

You know, Richard Feinman relates in 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feinman' his observation that people don't often understand the abstract ideas they're working with.  He makes that conjecture based on the fact that most of his students can't recognize the phenomena that they're studying at play in real time all around them.  So one of his teaching methods, well, maybe it's more style, was to sort of tell little stories -- not made up tales, but descriptions of encountering the phenomena in real life.  In describing the experience of the phenomena in real life, a story has been created, and by recognizing the abstract in the real you demonstrate your understanding of it.  

So maybe the answer to the student's question is that the abstract doesn't represent reality until you create a story around it.  Stories are reality descriptions as we best understand reality.  They're not separate from the abstract, but the abstract doesn't become real until it becomes a story.  The abstract is real, but it's not as real as the story, which isn't as real as reality, but it's as close as we can come to comprehending reality.  Huh.  That's interesting, you know?

So."

I would like to see the data on global economics and the correlations between the two.....but a couple examples popped in my head immediately that counter that idea: the Soviet Union and Mao China had equality for males and females, but the Soviet Union eventually went bankrupt and it devastated its land (Aral Sea) and some policies at first led to millions of deaths (collective agriculture for example). Mao China had the ""great leap backward""....yes eventually it got its act together under Deng Xiaoping and grew a lot. But both had awful economic growth at times. On the other side, Japan is notoriously famous for its male/female gap in cultural privileges in formal and informal settings  but it has been one of the top world economies for the last few decades. I would say, ""Thanks Marshal Plan,"" but Japan was successful before WWII which made it into an imperial power house. A stable system of law and organization of society are important for economic growth, and equal rights and privileges for women is helpful because it doubles your work force and adds more ideas to society, but to say equal rights is the number 1 determiner of economic growth is dubious.  Show me the data."

""The most unhappy people are liberal men.""  That's the tortured artist effect.  Liberals can be some of the most intolerant, closed minded people -- witness their aggression towards Trump.  They are children throwing a temper tantrum.  They are ""open"" when they are with other liberals, when they are flattered for their openness by other liberals in their self congratulation societies.  Otherwise, they'll tell you to STFU and close you down.  I think there is creativity on the left and on the right.  Nietzsche tried to appeal to the right but he got co-opted by the left.

May I ask what's your opinion on Mulan? Does this movie also use an archetype? It seems to me that it does. There are fairytales about a woman disguising herself as a man who is very good in her new role and becomes a successful man. In Mulan, the main heroine saves her battalion. In a fairytale, the name of which I can't recall right now but it was an Arabic fairytale, a disguised heroine becomes the king's (or prince's) right hand. These two heroines get discovered as females, get shunned, and then they become even more powerful and successful. Mulan saves her country, the fairytale heroine becomes the queen of a prosperous kingdom. I was wondering a lot about Mulan and her transitions from and to her female form and the fact that it is not confusing at all. I can't recall a Western myth with the same story, except for the story of Achilles posing as a woman, but it's not the same, is it?"

I believe that HPA-axis activation causes changes in the hippocampal structures and therefore in episodic memory.

John Ranelagh writes of Margaret Thatcher's remark at a Conservative Party  policy meeting in the late 1970's, ""Another colleague had also prepared a paper arguing that the middle way was the pragmatic path for the Conservative party to take .. Before he had finished speaking to his paper, the new Party Leader [Margaret Thatcher] reached into her briefcase and took out a book.  It was Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty.  Interrupting [the speaker], she held the book up for all of us to see.  'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table.""  (John Ranelagh, Thatcher's People:  An Insider's Account of the Politics, the Power, and the Personalities.  London:  HarperCollins, 1991.)

JBP always (and rightly) attacks the soviets for their totalitarianism but I think it is interesting to see how a totalitarian approach to neoliberalism affects people in the long term.  I think we are starting to see that it is just as damaging to the wellbeing of it's citizens (lack of health care, lack of affordable housing, unable to buy food or heating, lack of mental care or care for the elderly, blue on blue violence caused by an inability to rise up the dominance hierarchy).

Thank you for what you do! :-) Today, I was happy to hear you mention Jung's exploration of astrology. Most academics don't even mention that. I do however believe that Jung's fascination went a bit deeper than simply thinking of it as ""projections"".  Just like individuals, ""the collective"" goes through repetitive cycles, that are mathematically ""ordered"" over Time. Joseph Campbell also described this ""night sky fascination"". And regarding ""openness"" and ""conscientioousness"": if my understanding of both traits is correct, I would say you also possess them both. Wouldn't that be ""the ideal""?
