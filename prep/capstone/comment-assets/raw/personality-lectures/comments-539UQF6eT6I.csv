The scientific model of reality is ""Cognitive-Theoretic"", meaning the CTMU, but it's not ""PC"" enough for academics. As with the past, the ""laymen"" will force the issue and ""authorities"" will find some way to water-down the truth, but the game is not at the ""make or break"" point in history. In the near future, we either side with humanity and therefore America, or else follow the Communist dogma towards an automated technocratic totalitarianism. Elites will control the Earth and masses of illiterates, via self-building robots, and without the possibility of human rebellion since literacy will be forever controlled by a tiny class of overlords.

UgiY-t9jOSE7CXgCoAEC,Eric M.,1504484537213,"I think a good way to introduce Heidegger is through the metaphysical reversal he undertakes. Rather than knowledge or meaning being an object ""out there"" to be grasped ex post facto by a rational subject ""in here,"" the ""subject"" (Dasein) always already ""possesses"" meaning to the extent that prior to any rational thought or contemplation of things, things must appear in the first place. So to say that the world is meaningless is contradictory because the world IS meaning. Now you could still say that there is no ULTIMATE meaning, but the mere fact that things manifest themselves at all indicates that there is meaning."

Now before we start let me explain my dream neighborhoods. Whenever I am outside in a dream and can see the surrounding structures it's always a blur of houses or buildings I have seen or been too. I understand that, the dream is filling in the blanks with familiar buildings. The buildings should be along this sidewalk otherwise the world is broken, let's just check the files on buildings and copy/paste. Originally it was houses and the like but more recently businesses and video game/media buildings, so things from movies and such.

Basically any place I actually document as special I could dream of in this neighborhood. Well in this dream it was a collection of houses, my mothers work, and my church (Which is across the street from my mothers business) This neighborhood actual consisted mostly actual houses from the block around my mothers business, just one or two were different.

I don't remember half the dream, only the part that terrified me and the parts before that. For some reason a tiger was sleeping on a swing in front of one of the houses that actually exists next to my mothers work. I did everything I could to sneak past that big bengal tiger. I reached a house that didn't belong there and tried to enter thinking it the house of my mothers current secretary. Surely she would help me. Problem is the concrete porch was missing up close to the door and I fell making a loud noise and waking the tiger.

I turned and ran a distance before it caught me, tackled me, and bit into my stomach. The whole thing woke me up screaming because my blanket bunched around my stomach making it feel like something was actually biting down on my stomach. I threw my blanket off and went running.

This dream disturbs me to this day and I don't know why."

Uggy7yYJ3DsoWXgCoAEC,Peter M,1504484541284,"It was mentioned, that radical reconfiguration of society is almost always a catastrophe, however it may be the only option for people placed at the bottom of hierarchy, especially if establishment is set to exploit. It may be the only way to move forward and sometimes it works. For instance, French revolution brought human rights, overthrow absolute monarchy and allowed to establish republics. It may be the case, that revolution is inevitable unless the system gradually delegates power and allows climbing hierarchy."
UggG5XPD8FHbQHgCoAEC,Julian,1504484541296,"This teacher says that Dasein is the ""totality of experiencing"" in which everyone is ""encapsulated"". This statement makes no sense to me. Heideggers term Dasein simply refers to humans, in what makes humans human, which is that they relate to their being. ""Dasein versteht sich in irgendeiner Weise in seinem Sein"" - Dasein comprehends itself in some manner in its being and makes it amenable in the sense of ""I am"". On top of that reasoning may or may not appear (animal rationale / zoon logon echon). That is a very central element in his philosophy and it doesn't seem adequately grasped in this strange lecture that claims to be about phenomenology while consisting of one hour of anecdotal insights and twenty minutes of phenomenology. And some of his statements are downright outrageous. Marx certainly never argued that the people who gained a status of elite in a system created the system. That's paradoxical. And the proposition of this teacher that music business being dominated by few musicians and one percent of the world population owning more than half of the worlds wealth would be basically the same and sort of an inevitable natural development makes me utterly speechless.

UggOAzRHdkvKj3gCoAEC,LG Brown,1504484541455,"I feel that letting Nietzsche 'off the hook', so to speak, for parts of his philosophy that are easily applicable to totalitarian culture is a cherry-picking view of his commentary.  You discuss his idea of value-creating, but we shouldn't forget that he said quite clearly that the value-creating was a function of very rare ""higher men"".  He also said that lesser men [which comprise the vast majority of us] didn't just NEED to be dominated by man with the strength and will to dominate, but that they WANTED to be.  With that axiom in place, it isn't stretch at all for the rationalization and application of the dark deeds that came not long after.  

I think a more effective argument against his idea of value-creating [if you agree that such a thing is possible in the first place] is that most people aren't able or willing to do it - a view that is congruent with his actual work and a more practical real-world counterpoint.  I think that - even if one can't create truly new values - that Nietzsche's 'higher men' are capable of adopting a set of values that sometimes will discard parts of the social contract.  This can be valuable and positive for an actualized person, but can also be an effective tool and downright dangerous in the hands of extremists.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Nietzsche is to blame for the rise of totalitarian culture, but pretending that his message was merely warped, or misinterpreted by the 20th century idealouges isn't a fair analysis of the work.  He had a lot dangerous ideas; he said so himself."

There are a great many paradoxes in life, but one of the most profound and significant is the fact that a person's reason for living is often also their reason for dying.

Alan Watts has a solution to the man governed by unconscious - don't say what you are going to do (which activates resistance) -- just do it.

I acknowledge that it may be interesting to read these other writers, maybe even clarify those ideas, but they're not playing with original material of their own. If I read a psychoanalyst's book and learn some things about it I wouldn't say it is their idea, or say what they said as if its their idea, it is important to give credit where is due, after all it was Nietzsche who paid the 'price' for those ideas in many ways, not those other thinkers."

Doing this also seems like a mental trick designed to override reason because as you said there is no way to fight a rationalist when he or she says that in the scheme of things all we do is meaningless, seems to be a trick to ignore reality (as meaninglessness is a reality in as far as it is true) to be able to function in any given society; if any given action in a society is meaningless in another or another set of beliefs, we can use this tool to still function within that society, a religious practice for example is meaningless to a nonbeliever, etc.... men as the measure of all things, things don't have meaning or value unless we.....
