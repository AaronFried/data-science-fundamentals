UgynLScSVNRVQ8tB9mF4AaABAg,Nick Bultman,1535848183301,"Here’s an example of a personal journey I go through while watching these videos.. 

Around (1:07:00) “Snakes. Two halves of the same dna molecule” 
Jordan lives in the world of pattern and  loosely defined words to allow for his own self affirming story to manifest. His a priori structures are filtered wired for interest in fantasy, All nested within the deeper motivation of subconscious drives to power. In essence, his message and impact is merely the natural pattern of molecules to assemble power to their own purpose. The stupidity of the snake idea would only capture the interest of those who also are wired to be interested in fantasy.
-a cynical thought manifests in me

But what’s the underlying motivation for an idea like that to manifest within me? What am I compensating for? What in the world am I ignoring? 

Perhaps, my comment was aimed at cutting my ideal at the knees, because why not? My ideal is to be like Jordan, but I clearly have a lot of work to do. 

if we use Jordan’s definition of truth pragmatic in the sense that the intention of action in relation to my ideal is the marker of its truthfulness, then my commentary about Jordan is contradictory with my highest ideal 

So now I should stop myself from identifying with those types of thoughts and reframe them: 

Jordan’s has been able to notice and articulate the deepest patterns of human behavior, and has developed a following not just as a result of self affirimation and hunger for power, but with the intention to help others manifest the ideal of God within us. 
-a positive reframe of the snake idea

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I wanted to create a personal account and want to see if others relate"

After consuming every lecture (2 per day rewinding when needed to help my understandings develop) on Maps and Meaning as If I had a tyrannical father (in fact any father at all would have done i guess hahaha) who had paid for that education I then moved onto this series, thank you wholehearted Professor Peterson I could never have dreamed of getting my hands on this level of education from my upbringing or young adult life, it's all mind blowing but in a very good way. 

Which lectures or resources would you recommend next? I am currently reading Jung, The Modern Man in Search of a Soul and Orwell's, The Road to Wigan Pier, when i get my head somewhat around these I will be focusing on your book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos which i just ordered online yesterday, thanks again.

You begin questioning existing practices AND suggesting means of improvement-- movement towards ORDER.

In just those few words it feels as though Mr.Peterson summed up what he knew life to be about. It’s crucial at times like these for us to really let it sink in for a moment. I for one, will remember this for the rest of my life:

“Be what you can be. God, you let the world around you dissolve otherwise. That’s not a good thing. You got something that everyone needs man, including yourself. That’s why, let it out, that’s where everything you want is. It’s the case for every single one of you. So, hoist up your goddamn privilege and go out there and do something in the world.”"

Not long after hearing a similar statement in another lecture, a very close and dear friend of mine was hospitalised and sadly, facing death. My partner and I decided to try our best to be the ""useful"" people, who helped him and his family throughout the entire process from his illness, to his passing and funeral etc.. 

As an unexpected benefit: It has helped US in the healing process, to be actively involved in the event and it has helped me say goodbye and grieve fully while honoring the loss of a great mentor and friend. We have also formed much closer relationships with mutual friends and his family.

If I could sum up my thoughts to the solutions for our current political dilemmas in a simple phrase, it would be:

Think like an architect, not like a partisan.

Architecture might be abstracted to using the interplay of opposing forces to create stable, beautiful, and useful structures. Consider how your partisan interests REQUIRE an opposition in order to create stability. Reflection on the work of the US Constitutional Convention might help us to see that the vision embraced was grander than that of a winning party. It was about a larger vision of using the interplay of opposing forces in order to create a dynamic and stable system that we can all live in, a system that was able to survive through a self correction on one of the oldest scourges of humanity..... slavery, which WAS NO SMALL FEAT! As I see it, THIS is the level we should aspire to. To create something we can be proud to bestow to humanity for future generations. A gift to the future."

Avoid psychology like you would avoid the Inquisition. 

This man is a sociopath.

Tho whole point of psyche and human heritage is to enjoy the ability or necessity to grow and change (which are analogous or isomporphic processes) while and even by maintaining and enjoying a persistent and consistent orientation to all the psychological as biological organs of communication (family and self-identity, the symbiotic trinity of truth, sense and relationship to one's whole environment), any failure or corruption of which leads to the evident compulsion to sacrifice who one is (or was born as - the Word or any language or science worthy of the name - made flesh) for who one ""could be.""

Such is the corrupting premise (the latter) of the primary artifact of cultural genocide insinuated into and thus gaining the collusion-with-plausible-impunity of every constituent human organ and family of a cybernetic-industrial society - fucking Xianity.

Sense and magic on the far horizon hand-to-mouth
Inimitable vittles the fulfillment every breath
An understanding that enjoys the pictures that abound

In the old days of the 1900s and 1800s a teacher had to be someone who was actually good at, well, teaching.
It wasn't a slip of paper or a degree that made a teacher it was their ability to excite people's minds and make them think.
Today, through ""management"" and ""administration"" we've made sure that those people who are best able to regurgitate become teachers.  This is why the university system is, in a word, failing.

Maybe in some small way what Peterson is doing will lead to a new kind of teaching, one where people learn the contents of courses for free through videos and then go to these schools to take the exams and tests to find if they know the course content. By making schools a geographical solution, we make sure that getting into the good schools is a question of luck and not of ability or aptitude.  Being born to the right parents in the right geographical area and being lucky enough to enjoy the things that the local renowned schools focus on is a poor way to maximize the productivity of any given population.

The morality of Social Justice is a morality of guilt, where the best you can hope for - if you’re part of the privileged groups - is to be harmless.  To get out of the way of the oppressed people.  To be a good ally.  What a contrast this is to the call to be a hero! To make yourself into a strong, upright, powerful force for good. Knowing your capacity to do horrible things, yet choosing to turn that strength to the good - the good of everyone. Choosing to tell the truth and having faith that the consequences will be the best that they possibly could be. What an exciting story to live. To quote The Dark Tower: ""Remember the Face of your Father"". Thanks, Professor Peterson."

So JBP always mentions people high in neuroticism in a context that they are anxious or depressed most of the time, or react to certain situations inadequately. Soooo, does it mean that ppl that are high in trait neuroticism were just unlucky to be born high in this trait and doomed to suffer more than those who score low on this specific trait?! Can people high in neuroticism shift this trait closer to the balance or being even low on neuroticism?

UghKyBEFkhm9d3gCoAEC,Southern Israelite,1504485072944,"American Patriotism is Anarchist Atheism; You Cannot believe in Jesus and Libertarianism.

1.Subjective Value is nihilistic, makes man God and denies the authority of the Bible.

2. Libertarianism promotes a laissez-faire policy of the state toward the market. The principle of opportunity cost precludes the idea of neutrality. There is no neutrality in this world. You are either with or against. Mat. 12: 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

3. Hierarchy and Authority is grounded in the family. Every argument Libertarians make against Statism and Slavery can all equally apply to the human family. Moreover, there is a Government among the unfallen angels in Scripture. Government is not a result of sin.

4. Both Biology(Haplogroups) and Scripture(Rom. 9:1-3, Rom. 11[Jews, Gentiles]) denotes
collective identities not merely individuals.

5. Capitalism is Darwinism pace Darwin’s emphasis on Competition which he alludes to in Origen of Species in discussion of Herbert Spencer.

6. Ayn Rand was an Inspiration to the Church of Satan:
http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php

7. The Libertarian distinction between Ethics and Economics is meaningless.

8. Private Property just means Individual Sovereignty/Satanism; Judges 17:5 every man did what was right in his own eyes.

9. The Bible’s prohibition against Usury is a prima facie denial of the entire system of Capitalism and the modern Banking industry. John Calvin’s distinction between Business loans and charity is refuted by Neh. 5.

10. Since the Bible forbids usury it ipso facto forbids the Gold Standard

11. The rich are generally demonized as immoral people in the Bible. Mark 10:25 “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

12. Free Trade is a method used by the Satanic rich to make money for themselves at the expense of their countrymen’s poverty and misery.

13. The Economic consequences of letting people do what they want are disastrous in the light of comparative advantage and opportunity cost. The financial and physical strength of our people is wasted on their atheist and nihilistic pursuits such as sports, abortions, STDs, degenerate entertainment etc.

14. Libertarian Christians say sins are not crimes necessarily. They will say the sin is a crime only if the OT law demands a penalty, but then they turn around and say the penalties are ceremonial: i.e. Jubilee-remittance of debt, is ceremonial. They use sophistry to make the law powerless and meaningless. Disgusting!

15. The US Constitution is betrayal to the Protestant Solemn League and Covenant, and is Satanic and Counter Reformation. Article 6 clause 3 of the US Constitution:

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.”

16. Communists are not Darwinists; they are Pantheistic Buddhist Mystics."

I have a BSc degree in audio engineering, but unfortunately i was too stupid to utilize the school and university studying for my actual education, not to say that that would have been sufficient given that I live in Serbia, and you can imagine the system here. Fortunately I do have the practical know-how in my field, that being music and audio, so I am somewhat useful, but the stuff you talk about just isn't that, is it.

I seem stuck on the idea that materialist rationalism can't account for creativity.  I also love the Tao symbol of chaos and order.... I have a notion this is tied directly into the dual hemispheres of our minds and how they influence being while being tied to the animal brain that drives our base motivations. Walking the line between order and chaos is balancing the two sides of our minds. The literal and the emotional, objects and perception, feeling and thought.  We find the bliss of meaning when we are keeping both sides engaged.  A hypothesis for why we enjoy music is that it's structured and rational but it draws on our emotions at the same time.  I think this may be why music helps study, because when your engaging both sides of the mind you are actually using a higher percentage of your minds potential.  This makes facts and understanding them easier to transcribe into memory at the same time.  Can IQ be looked at as a measure of how well you can bring the power of both sides of your mind to a task at the same time.   I'm not sure what is wrong with this idea but I think it feels true."

UggVeE6mM8XcSngCoAEC,Artemirr Lazaris,1504485094648,"Well, I have never attempted to get  a 100% as I find there is no current point as I currently think the system is a exploitive mean, that has been taken over. Peterson is oblivious.

The first course I ever failed, was by a bias, no matter how i wrote it in an english course, she gave me less then 50% on each paper. Then she made her own means of union protection and I even went to the dean,. Out of 22 students 8 dropped out because of her. She had to announce her sexuality every class that I questioned, she had shown work in class that was written poorly as an example. Her A graded paper was littered with errors, I even stated them all. She is measuring by emotion and feeling and not logical and what is of error, so if you write with  an emotion that is objective they or these individual cannot mark correctly. 

SO if your writing for the stupid females that have been proper up by feminist groups, write for the mention and feeling like a script fora movie, pander to their fucking retardation. if its man, well write how you feel and correctly. You get A, and they see to actually make grammar correctly and can associate style outside of grammar. In a formal or non formal. Of course Passing any course is pretty easy. 

If I said what was a determination of my grades, would be the socializing nonsense that was being narrated int the minds fate people and they were masses of idiots following the world politics, of AL gore type people that are predatory and wolves. Of course this is how we are today. 

Now we have masses of people forcing themselves not and destroy my culture that I once belonged too, and they re write and continue pr, against individuals, but thats abroad spectrum. 

I think Peter is way off. 

I have met people that fired me from a job, because I had judgemental eyes. 

I have met women that have judged me by stating, the way I look that I have never had a hard day in life.
I have met people that stated to entire class, look at him, he can get any girl he wants. Now I was 21 at this time and virgin and i didn't really understand what he meant. Most people thought I live under a rock, because they did weird social behaviours narrated by ficiotn as the norm. So these groups and peoples destroy me, so I behave and act like the to merge, but then I am depressed, and these people use and mark money as a success and not the association of works and wealth as actions. instead, large slave factories of people to create shitty products when most can be automated and not exploited, however thats beside the points.

SO I Would say, that the warmonger is creating and making nonsense.

My individual life of my family has been having a microscope at the age of 4-7 and I did many other factors, th entire market is to destroy the human bio-system, and movies or entertainment, has been become, captivate and capture. Which puts all to death, whereas family history german and english, working on atom bombs and speaking many languages, now in this place I have been trapped by divisional politics that are making enemies, but the only enemy I see is these people stealing fro the public purse and the thefts they have acquired form these entities. Community is broken because its forcing us to share with people that do not have the right trials thus forcing death of the entire world. That is what is happening, which is different, when I say death, tis human loos of life that must ha open because of the exploitation. Seriously what did my grandfather fight for? feminism to narrate men are evil? I could go int the money bubble of disreality, but its not true to the actions in which creates. So we have this notion of money and divine in which has been created, rather than it as a natural fact of works and trade, instead we have capital lslavers that use capital to  abuse works and pay unfairly. The education of these abuses are made everywhere, in society. More so, and more. 

Remel and AL Gore. 

Why am I stating this.

Well Remel made a question statement that was taken way outside thermal of reality, and stole money, this has a massive impact on society, thus avarice is a sickening sort. Google, Samsung and many other outlets must be destroyed, Cosco. Individual super wealth over the state is not allowing the creation of the need of works needed for th state, in which we are enslaved too, instead its an abuse and mismanagement and self dictators which put themselves everywhere as an importance, like some hollywood crutch. Its witchcraft of nonsense. Man..
A world f dis-reality, and forced reality of fictional reality. by stating it as a nromalcy or reality, its like borderline bringing back the death penalty, by capital abuse. Ben shapiro psychopathic murderer, as with everyone else. But peace made this is ignored. Its radical groups that took it over. in the 1920 feminism movements fought against the veil. So what does one do, when the works are stolen form a person. What a world.... Information of idiots. Science is or isn't.

I remembe r7th grade science. Were given a hypothesis and we have to prove it. IF we don't prove it (Which was the case) then we must make a real conclusion and hand it it. SO the alb of our science class was to prove what the teacher said, which was impossible, as the tests would give other results. During pipetting. Then we have to come to another conclusion based onto information of what were using, and make statements to agree with. This world of love and understanding and building is removed by greedy idiots. In which state the nonsense of the world. 

Openly stating, exploiting smart peoepl to get rich, you see the upside down notion. Thus then accusing and forcing slavery, who the hell are these christians. Then not allow us to kill them,thats basically the jewish problem hitler was to address by the capital liars and it is totalitairsm . So where do we go? The world of darkness comes running in. Sigh.. reality.. and love smash to bits by greed. All from envy and jealous and liars, just pigs of humans.


So what did I do to myself... Not really sure, other hone only putting in 60-70% effort as I can see in side the mind of cause and affect to 90% plus accuracy when I judge people in my mind, to garner their actions or past actions, and I ask questions that verify but do not reveal my underlying questions, so perception brings answers, even if I am being amicable. What is that, meh I don't know, but asking questions gives one information. Without directly asking the question that would give the answer wanted ,to making the person feel awkward. Me.. The world now.. psyhotechnics,and more crap.. wow what a world of hate... Formed by greed. Funny from everything to nothing and those people keep re writing and lying about history."
UggILSG2jgXY9HgCoAEC,William Koscielniak,1504485094718,"Peterson said that William James and Pragmatism is the only brand of genuine American philosophy.

Craig the owner of Cosco, these entities control and force polices of migration and create a system of ruin, in which if they are removed from the hector, all things collapse, its ancient style of societal narcissism, versus , ensuring the society is not reliable on one person, but one person can add much tho the community, and the laws and structure of our society have been removed. Entertainers are idiots and clowns paid to lie, whilst these marxist entries are taking over and quite blatent. These monopolies also in pursuit, such as fast food chains, are pyramid and against state funding and the classic models of the family sizes are removed and monopolized by unsound minds with the intent in which copies, deploys and by aesthetics and words take over. Thus specialized parties and loyalty nonsense cards are created, this is a classic war schism for divide, This has been ingested by the entire system thus its a beast system in which has taken over aggressively. 

People like al gore, and eco at the Royal Bank and more places, should be removed and re ordered by law and regulations which aims to stop the harm being caused, as to have natural set, instead, open slavery and exploitation form asai is a problem. So if the exploitation continues, it would be in the best interest to kill off all humans theatre being exploited to ensure the survivability of natural autonomy and community, thus these entities na groups will be forced to return. 

Jordans nonsense often relies on his nonsense view of reality, because of what he has been fed, ignores where the products come form, and the original makers made fair wages and the ability of life to flourish, These people make no amends for their crimes and continue to march over all.

The world of liars. 

Look at the actors taking positions in which academics and areas of study were and existed. Look at the democrats and their forced investments by the use of government forcing an global warming narrative, and not allowing a fair use of mind, and played the card for money, undermining the entire culture over here and blleding out our technical wealth to tyrants and idiots. that use capital lt control which benefits the use of banks, thesis s sick state in which they operate. Of course the fat useless pigs, keep supporting and buying the shit, because they don't want to know, as the philosophy of war goes, Ie Entertainment of pandering to the masses is give them what they want politics is destroying the society.

UgiWbO8-7ex7vHgCoAEC,marcanta,1504485094911,"Powerful... What can I say? I discovered you on your first appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast back in December. I have since then gone through your Maps of Meaning course, your Personality course, TONS of clips from these lectures that are circulating on youtube and various interviews, podcasts and now the biblical series. It's just invaluable the information that i have recieved from you! I have questioned my habits and surroundings before but not with these tools. This time it's with a more extensive understanding on how and why things work the way they do and that gives me WAY more motivation to put what I've learned into practice so that I can become a better person. It seems less likely I can become willfully blind towards a potential demise of my being so how could I not be motived towards striving towards the good of life?

He starts from his own preconceived notions about values and obligations and his whole mental framework is designed to justify it. It's strikingly obvious from the way he speaks, sometimes he just lets it slip out and even he doesn't notice.

Also, despite how careful and intelligent he is when he is speaking, he makes SOOOO many fallacious assumptions or reasonings, completely invalid lines of logic, he uses artistic metaphorical language and tries to pull some objective facts out of it. His whole world view is just completely fudged"

UgiTP5ZTZMydVXgCoAEC,Avery Fleeharty,1504485104839,can someone explain on a physical or chemical level why a baby without touch/interaction would die?
UgjiEoZmxcvBHHgCoAEC,Qimodis,1504485104853,"The problem I have is that he insists that suffering is always undeniable and positive emotion is always deniable. It is possible to be in an apathetic and decadent state where you don't care about the stake through your arm, but, on the other hand, if you are really experiencing something meaningful or good, it is virtually equally hard to deny in my opinion. From the outset, we are forced pragmatically, based on biological processes that we only half-understand, to accept one thing as better than the other, as a minimum supposition for action. Doesn't it make sense to make the smallest necessary amount of unprovable suppositions? Sam Harris takes certain suppositions as axiomatic, and even if his breaching of the is-ought gap is technically wrong, the results he arrives at are good- and aren't the results the whole point of religious truth here? The same religion can take many forms and be interpreted to justify wildly differing actions, and it is really the culture or rather the generalized meta-culture that actually assigns value within society. 

PS
I think that it is incomplete to say that conscientiousness is just about being distressed when you aren't doing anything: it is the combination of distress and a pleasant feeling of fulfillment when you are doing something, and similarly, if you are an introvert, there is little comparable to the rush of dopamime when after a noisy day, you go somewhere where you realize you are completely alone and undisturbed- that is why many children on the autistic spectrum like to hide under boilers, it excludes the entire world around them and allows them to be in a kind of blissful peace. (in my personal experience, I liked to crouch in the little switch room/boiler room of the house, and, while there was no noise from the outside, imagine that that room was the entire universe, and was floating through empty void/vacuum. The feelings of extreme calm and, well, coziness were certainly more than a 'relief of suffering' or 'being alone in a crowd', I was fine just walking around, but it was pleasant to do it.)"

I see the notion of ""god"" as inherently childish, as grown adults looking to it as a sort of parent instead of being self reliant. I don't think someone who has confidence and sees themselves as an adult can honestly believe in religion, as it is basically the idea of forever being a child. Some people may be too weak to grow up and accept responsibility for their actions, and religion is a good way to keep these weak people adhering to society, but it doesn't change the fact that it is by definition a childish way of looking at the world."

UgiDnFo_cru3VngCoAEC,Belias Phyre,1504485110169,"I have an odd habit I've noticed. When I do something good out of the ordinary, I feel good about it and want to do it again up until I receive praise from my Mom. Once she notices it, and comments positively on it, I want to throw it away, scrap it, deface it. I'm not exactly sure why, but it has shaped a lot of my behavior. The opposite isn't true, if I act badly, and she notices and comments, I don't double down to spite her, or cease to please her; her opinion doesn't matter. 

I think it may be that I don't want her to feel a sense of accomplishment from my accomplishments because I feel I've accomplished this thing in spite of her, not because of her. So I guess this means I see my mother as an antagonist, which makes sense. When I was a child, my brother was a fiend and a sadist towards me. Most nights I was afraid to sleep, believing he might feel like ending my life while I was helpless. But I understood, even though my brother was a monster, my mother enabled, even rewarded his behavior, so who was the bigger threat?"
