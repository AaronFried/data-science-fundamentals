UghObnWBZAwsyHgCoAEC,Jack Tomlinson,1504484552423,"He says at 38.42 positive or negative ""valence"". I looked it up and it's a drape or chemistry. I guess he means it like a positive or negative filter but I've never heard it used like that before"
UghwNLzGOq0UengCoAEC,Deity1,1504484552436,"What would society look like if machines ran most jobs allowing people to explore while not worrying about food, shelter, etc.? Would it be like Wall E only on earth and with fewer fat humans or would we get bored and fight just to have a challenge?"
Ughap61qpPf2cXgCoAEC,Aram Santogidis,1504484552451,"I was thinking a lot about concepts explained in this lecture (and the ones before this one). It is so impressive how these concepts are connecting together. A lot confusion I was experiencing, is gone already. A big thank you for uploading the recordings."

UgjMoE7RAbViXXgCoAEC,TheMostGodless SinfulBastard,1472948552550,"Porf. I just wanted to share a talk/dialogue I watched with the Origins Project with Profs. Chomsky and Krauss and they discuss some of the issues you talk about here (language, will, involuntary action, autonomous action, etc) it is a 3-4 hr long discussion,  but they seem to have more definite ideas about the subjects, perhaps you find the time to look at it and perhaps you find them interesting?? I would love to hear your opinionS of it.

Hope you enjoy it."
Uggxzj41wYIMbngCoAEC,szivalj,1472948552562,"I love seeing the influence of Heidegger and Nietzsche in your thinking, you opened this lecture with an anecdote about the computer breaking that was exactly like Heideggers 'Presence-at-hand', what a great way to relate it to the way the brain works. I studied Heidegger a lot in undergrad school but my professors were never able to bring the subjects alive as you are doing."
UgjAh-6Bh-pis3gCoAEC,Ellie Schmitz,1472948552577,"Thank you so much professor, love your seminars and  feels like its deepening my own understanding  and others !

UgiJs-K1Tl6PZ3gCoAEC,Rince wind,1472948552589,I don`t like tuna either. It contains large amounts of heavy metals and environmental poisons. And it might even contain Fukushima radiation.

UgilZRuDrnnwjXgCoAEC,Ed in Burgh,1472948552631,"Min. 32:40 yes, entropy is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. S = k log W inscribed on Ludwig Boltzmann's gravestone. One of my heroes of science, having infered and postulated the existence of atomic particles, he was ridiculed for this by his peers. He suffered from depression all his life and committed suicide."
UgjF5aFQ4jIJA3gCoAEC,TheMostGodless SinfulBastard,1472948554826,"== The thing with the smoked tuna you mentioned... again, Nietzsche saying that consciousness is a terrible burden, and of course the more of it we have the more heavy a mental and emotional price we must pay. 
The more conscious you are of consciousness the more terrible it becomes, and it can become a vicious cycle?  Prof. I'm really attempting to go past Nietzsche, to go beyond it; but every other thing we examine it seems he was already there... he said (in one of his books of course) that he was looking for those more godless than himself and I have imagined he was referring to those philosophers of the future he spoke of at times, those arrows he throws into the future and someone else more daring picks it up and does the same thing and throws them further... do you know any of those people/authors??  To use a modified phrase of his; those I may read to go beyond good and evil, to go beyond Nietzsche??  It is a bit frustrating to always find that any idea he's been there before; your descriptions of the primordial drives that do not let us do anything of importance ourselves  is a good start, any ideas where to go next?? who to read beyond Nietzsche? We read the new philosophers and it is a rehash of the same, or worse, a misinterpretation of the philosophers who came before. They are smart, but they're NOT going beyond, further... perhaps they lack DARING?  The will to ""live dangerously"". If there are any you consider like this please tell me.

Thanks Prof."
