We have to clean up our room and God's room and the whole universe before we are done and if we don't, we suffer and get chased under the bed by the Terrible Mother, a bed that has all the boogie men imagination can conjure.  So we promise to change our reality... and reality is giving us the tools to change reality and we say ""Hey, hold on reality!  You have been torturing me for quite a while now, giving me tools with no instruction manuals and now I don't know if you are real or not...  except for the pain, which tells me you are real... a real bastard trying to improve me with ""Tough Love.""

The letter is not a letter but something that contains all our projections.  So you can say the world contains all our projections, all our attempts at framing some kind of meaning.  But this is the land of in sanity.  Cause everything is real and nothing is real.  Everybody projects what they want.  The person holding it thinks it is from the university.  The person looking over the guy's should and see the letter thinks it is his letter from his sweet heart, the mailman delivering the letter thinks it is a bill... so what is it?  It is everything and nothing.

This is starting to appear very post modern.  Everything is relative there is no truth.

Pattern is the object people see.  We can not see meaning.  Meaning arises after the pattern but the pastern has to make sense to provide a meaning and it does so quickly (a recognition) that we are not conscious of it."

UgwMxz8vgfTxAo253_d4AaABAg,Mister S,1509755273704,"hi dr. peterson.
i have a problem and i was wondering if i could get a response from you.
i know i'm a hyper intellectual person and i have a very wide grasp on reality. and based on the definition which you gave to schizophrenia that a person can't control their perception and find meaning in many experiences of event of their reality, i find myself too prone to that and well it's a little overwhelming in some senses because i'm a medical student and practice for myself psychoanalysis and psychology and i have read many thinkers such az nietsche,dostoyevski,jung,frued (and etc) and actually put myself to examine my life through the lenz with which these thinkers viewed their world. this out take on reality gives me a sharp and sometimes absurd and pessimistic perception of myself and the others around me (and of course most of the time my view about their motives and their behind the action thought processes are right) and that's a view on reality that is destructive for a person and is some kind of apple of eden and one cannot shift his view if one sees what is about to come of a event despite the fact that this view could potentially put harm to them.
and my main problem now is drug abuse which is most constant with weed and this drug puts my perception in a boost on checking reality and searching deeper for the intentions behind the action of people and the feeling of grasping a set of system about another person mind and motives is a wonderful feeling and i know human mind cannot simply put this feeling aside and live a life. 
i also tried LSD and a drug named Dextrometorphan which is a NMDA antagonist and to put it simple it acts like ketamine a dissociative at the same time some psychedelic trip and is a far more complex drug psychologically than any other drugs which i got a hold on them.
but these habits are making me melancholy most of the time and i have a sense of triumphant all of the time which is making me very egocentric. 
I don't know how i can go on living and its tearing me apart . but it's at the same time too much beautiful to let go of the path of truth of other peoples and myself reality. i don't know how i can handle this problems but i know you have had some of these problems yourself and i was wondering if you could help me.
btw i'm from IRAN and unfortunately i don't have much to be able to support you or donate a little but i love your work and as dostoevsky said ""poverty is not a vice"" .

best wishes Dr. B Peterson and much love."

Кто случайно сюда забрел
И бродит без цели, навострив ушки,
На сто тысяч лет я вперед изобрел
Метафизические ловушки,
Расставив их тут и там,

And I have seen people make stands for jewelry out of a dry piece of wood and it 's amazing.

Ugi5LBYqdcP6C3gCoAEC,Waylon Flinn,1504484898922,"In my mind science, and the objectification it creates, are about establishing invariants. First, it established invariants across the experience of separate individuals. Second, it sought invariants across time and space (after those concepts were identified as foundational). In that sense I would say that ""objectification"" is not a single thing. It is a collection of things defined by the set of invariants across which it operates.

Furthermore, if we experience meaning directly, we experience it not as a singular meaning, but instead as a plurality, a set of potential meanings. One of the functions of science, and observation in general, is to reduce this plurality of meaning to a singular or near singular set of meanings. This reduction of meanings yields power over the environment.
 
Paradoxically, that power over the environment then leads to an even greater multiplicity of meanings. Since each object can now be manipulated in a greater number of ways, producing a greater number of possible outcomes. I would further posit that fear and anxiety are a direct result of the indeterminate multiplicity of meanings. The greater the number of possible meanings, the greater the level of fear and anxiety. In this way technology (the power yielded by science) leads to both nihilism and totalitarianism."

I can see from both sides of the argument, and the ideas presented are useful tools, but I have to come down on Dr. Harris's side in terms of the most efficient understanding of the world, and truth. Knowing how human beings model that internally, what little engines and personalities in the mind pre-digest the world for us, doesn't change that.

I keep coming back to the idea of a simulated world. If you're a player, you see the entire game in terms of how it affects you, but if you're the programmer, you always find the idea of objects as a more minimal representation. It's all about what's more interesting to you: the streams of your own possibilities, or modeling the world itself in the most simple way.

If you're solipsistic, the whole world is about understanding the self. But if you're social or a scientist, thinking of the world in terms of objects is always going to be the more efficient representation of how to think about possibilities."

If it isn't, I'll have failed to communicate the illusion or idea\narrative effectively (or at all). I'll have failed as a painter.

If I didn't have a deep understanding of what I was attempting to represent artistically,
I'd consider myself incompetent in visual language. 

Pinoccio, for example; the thought and intentionality that went into creating that animation is obvious.
Though I suppose this isn't always the case (an artist being completely aware of the greater implications of their work).

It is also possible that I've got it all wrong and I'm too busy trying to control the outcome to actual make meaningful art."

 We certainly tricked ourselves into thinking our scientific breakdown ARE reality.  The real world is odorless, colorless, tasteless, soundless, and free of tactile sensations.  It's like, no it's not.  Naive realism is not naive at all.  In fact naive realism is more nuanced than the schools of abstraction that scoff at it's seemingly insipid position.  We are apart of that real world and our interpretive instruments and wiring is not an alien imposition. It is part of the dance.  It is part of the soup. You can't say cars don't really travel at high speeds, it is the imposition of a gas engine that make you think that way.  That is what is means to be a car.  It is a vehicle with an engine.  Sure you can disturb that image with abstraction in order to fix a problem or subject it to examination for improvements.  However this is the REAL alien procedure.  THIS IS THE FABRICATION.  The dissection of concepts and meaning.  Just because you can break something down, does not mean the composite parts are more truer than the compound from which it came from.   It is not a bad thing to do, BUT IT IS PLAY!  This is why hand held toy cars for kids don't have engines, it is play."

UgiXCbS7TyKrx3gCoAEC,Kon Berner,1504484933731,"The beauty is obviously not in the object itself. That is an ancient Zen idea of the fish in a pond viewing the ""beautiful woman"" and finding her completely uninteresting. The ""human beauty"" is at the intersection of a specific human perception and [that which is found beautiful by that human]. Are there statistical overlaps common to many humans? Yes, but this is not a reliable occurrence, it is statistical and highly variable: it requires subjective input to resolve an instance. The most that can be said is that it inheres in the object in the human context to a variable statistical extent."

It's better to disable eye movement with sedative which will cause you to see all white, that could be called to ""blank out"", not ""black out"".
