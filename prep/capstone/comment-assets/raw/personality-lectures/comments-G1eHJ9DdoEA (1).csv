Only in the area of ""antisocials""
You should specify the actual diagnosis: antisocial personality disorder (there is a difference), you know this.

There are more than enough ""antisocial"" people who are not aggressive/violent
Even those who, like myself, are misanthropes.

You are putting out the idea that all (men mostly) who prefer to be alone, are likely to be dangerous.
Thus, you are spreading this inaccurate assumption to groups of people, as well as along ""social"" media.

It would be nice to see you restructure this topic.
I mean, it is not so much that this is ""misinformation"", rather more that it is delivered in a way/context, where it can be easily misunderstood.
Which can then lead to inaccurate assumptions, by those who take it in."

They don't have enough information because it isn't taught to them by anyone.  So as far as I'm concerned there are no disagreeable people in the whole world.  True, criminals might be low in conscientiousness and low in agreeableness, and might gravitate towards political life as a result, but it can be argued that those people are the most agreeable people after all because they just obey whatever money chases.  They simply replaced people with money in terms of what they trust.  On the other hand, if we replaced money at the heart of our basis for trust in the world, we would see ""disagreeable"" people change their tune in a hurry.  We could do that by replacing the monetary basis with a chain of personal trust, demanding that each person have a personal contact with whom they wished to enter into a mutually trustworthy relationship with - linking every person to the top of the social hierarchy.   We should be able to realize that there are more productive motives than profit, and JP even admits that this is true for young men in general, however he quickly proceeds to contradict himself by stating that there's only one alternative to not playing the money game, and that's rotting to death by doing nothing.

Politically aspect.
------------
A light government that value the individual is democratic, the rest are socialist.

PC liberalism is an oxymoron, since can't be exist liberalism under the PC ideology (1).

If you open the border of the State you known exactly what happen for several reasons as:
- incompatible culture with the hosted Nations
- benefits without productivity and without time limit
- etc.
Welfare (beside bureaucracy), the source of all evil,  despite the fatal attraction that promote. 

---------------
Aggressiveness.
On children is just a primordial instinctive response to define a hierarchy.
A children must be educate to convey his energies on a manner compatible with a civil society.

---------------
The major difference between a civil democratic society and a don't liberal one is the lack of freedom of speech. 
The speech is an instrument used as substitute for the violence between individuals, so a speech can be harsh, don't respectful, etc..Now if you want an higher probabilities to change other opinions is better use a polite form, nothing more, nothing less.
Exist other points but perhaps I speak later about that.

1) When you impose (as legislation, rules, etc) how you must speak and later on which argument can be touched, you use the violence of the State, so you no longer live in a democratic society and you have no more freedom of speech."

Maybe its because I had a disagreement with other people about the passions I have with my stuff, like making music, videos, drawing pictures, and more, and feeling like maybe I'm just not as good as I am, and trying to argue about these things to prove I am, but ultimately making it worse, I have zero clue why, and maybe I'm over thinking this, but honestly, I feel like these first 9 minutes are so me, and for some reason it makes me sad.

Makes me more sad because I'm not even a woman, I am a male, maybe its because I have a higher amount of estrogen in me (I have natural man-boobs that are pretty notable tbh, so that's why I say that) than most males, I'm not sure.

Maybe its because I have aspergers?  I am still not sure, or maybe I'm just over thinking it, I really don't know, but whatever the reason, this video is striking a cord with me, and while I'm still crying, and probably will cry some more once I watch more, I thank you for making this video.

The only thing that differs is that they allegedly do not wish to see borders towards Chaos at large, but in truth they set them up in the small: Their safe spaces are nothing but artificial paradises supposed to keep the unwanted threats of their perception out, while also setting up their own classically chauvinistic borders towards their chosen combinations of superficial traits to be inferior to all the rest of humanity as they define it.

Only child, parents were always strict.
My mother always tells me how when I was very little I always ran around and was aggressive to other toddlers/kids.

But all I remember from my childhood is a constant sense of fear and embarassment in any kind of social situation, which I gather is due to a hyper-worried submissive type mother and a rage filled uninterested father.

Now I'm 23, been depressed since I can remember being conscious, have developed ADD and a complete inability to study, even though I was a super bookish child up to the first years of High School, so that I've ""lost""  my chance at being successful in the academical and work sense even though my entire childhood and teen years were dedicated to study (and trying to excel at a sport, thanks dad), with nothing else allowed. And boy did that ""paradox"" fuck me up psychologically

But even a child can give a full-grown man a deadly kick to the balls. Striking with proper form, and having the intent to harm the other person is key. I think the reason why women hitting their husbands are less likely to cause them harm is because they are not punching them with the full intent to seriously injure them in a vital area. And here you could say that agreeableness contributes to the lack of intent to harm. On the other hand, agreeableness can also contribute to an overwhelming determination to harm, in the defense of family.

I'm extremely disorderly with my home, I always have been. It was kinda beaten into me in elementary school that that was the way to go. Elementary school was so easy that I never did homework, I was actually reprimanded for making the amount I was comfortable with, which for math and native language class were the whole books the first day. I didn't need my books most of the time because in my home elementary school knowledge was common knowledge. I pretty much did what I wanted in school and had my own projects at home. As such I never really learned to form a schedule and stick to it. 

Now I've got a depression because of Asperger's Syndrome. I fight against my weakness of poor social skills and it takes a toll, but it's hard not to do it. All this makes my bad habits shine through even more, it's hard to find the extra energy to deal with something ""I don't notice, something that doesn't bother me""(48:06).. Living in an extremely messy home is counter-intuitive to what I want though(social equality between me and peers), so maybe I should pay more attention. Would love some advise on how to give a damn about it.

I'm not exaggerating about school and how it affected me. I've had my IQ tested and I'm north of 150, the only area the doctors and guys at Mensa could discern I'm even near average is the social intellect and that's a tad lower than average. Just like a psychopath you can meet me on the street and I can pretend to be normal, but get to know me and you'll see that I'm different, in good and bad ways.

I felt compelled to write this comment to thank you. You came to my attention, like many others, through your free speech battles, but this series and your other philosophical work has given me profound insight into my psyche and given me tools and ideas to work on for my own betterment.

While I'm grateful for this, what I really grateful for is giving me the framework to help someone else, someone who I care very deeply about and love very much, my partner. She has suffered with depression since she was in her mid teens and had a quite turbulent child hood. In the past when she would have a bad time or hit a low point I could be there for her as at best a comfort, which of course has value, but thanks to the lessons I have learned from your lectures I have been able to talk to her about her feelings. We did what you advocate and spoke the truth and see what happened. 

What happened was we had an intense but deeply gratifying conversation. One that didn't just sooth her, but one I think will help her grow, and in that process I felt I have grown and our relationship has become stronger.

She will be seeing a counsellor soon but I walked her through the big 5 attributes and suggested some actions from the past authoring suite and she took to the ideas really well. She has a lot of baggage from her past, so facing these will be tough, but she saw the value in doing it.

So I wanted to thank you for giving me the tools to sort myself out, but also help my partner sort herself out."

Uggs32jD_3qoA3gCoAEC,wahr01,1504485311131,"About 2/3 of the way through this lecture I realized why there was opposition to women voting (including from other women) - ""agreeableness"" has very little place in power-politics and even less place in geopolitics.
Interesting how science is bearing out what was earlier repudiated as merely ""imposed by religious authority"" as based in quantifiable truths of human behavior.  Religion served as an efficient means of carrying forward the most important human wisdom, and abandoning it has resulted in the dystopia we have today."
UgibdK6-hR1R5HgCoAEC,Michael Froelich,1504485311153,"I'm highly empathetic but when I perceive wickedness I never shrink from conflict.   I would not harm or kill an animal because I'm always wishing it well and hoping it's contented.   But if I perceive someone as monsterously wicked I have no problem imposing terrible punishments on them which I perceive they deserve.   And I'm thinking about their malice and cruelty to others, such as the animals I feel for, when I'm torturing them.  Therefore  I'm not sure the framework here comports with my experiences or observations.    I think the problem lies in grounding traits in evolutionary biological terms.    I think the development of personality isn't determined by evolutionary factors.    Humans exist on a different level of consciousness than animals, truly.   For example, I know a lot of women indifferent to others, including their own children.   I think if females show up as more agreeable on tests it's because of their need for acceptance.   Females will become fractured psychologically if they feel unworthy or not accepted.    Their agreeableness isn't empathy, but a strategy for finding acceptance by not wanting to stick out.   Young girls who are gifted and therefore different will hide their giftedness and exceptionalism so they will fit in and not be resented by others.    Boys would never do that.   Neither do boys starve themselves because they perceive their bodies as unattractively fat, or misperceive themselves as fat when they are not fat.    These are not founded in evolution but in the independence vs. dependence variation, with girls being completely dependent on their peers for emotional contentment whereas some boys want to be independent and stand out from others as exceptional.   As well there's confusion here about the traits of criminals.    Among professional criminals and those in prison there is wide variation.    There are predatory personalities and also empathetic personalities.     The most successful criminals are those who care about the well being of others, and therefore gain a reputation for honesty and fairness.     Only the born to lose idiots who never succeed at crime are the ones Peterson is describing here.     That applies only to the criminal world, which is actually a community.    On the other hand sociopaths who cheat everyone they encounter do not live in any community, but in large cities or they travel from place to place cheating everyone they meet.    Those are the people who cannot thrive in the underworld, and in the underworld those kinds of predatory individuals are loathed.    If Peterson understood criminality better he would view it as the economic and financial system it is rather than as an antisocial phenomenon.     Criminals are people seeking to find money.     And one last big thing.    Peterson's observations about the importance of socialization among peers for young children only applies to this culture, where children are thrown together in class rooms.    That is a very recent phenomena.    Until a hundred years or so ago children were not in groups of other children.    Children used to be socialized into their family or community in which their age group peers were not the determining factor.    Peterson's description of this purely recent, and frankly strange, way of treating children as a basic human condition is way off the mark.     I think the truth is that children were never intended to be socialized with their own peer group, and doing so has created these stresses and issues only recently.     Children should not be permitted to form their own cultures apart from that of their adult communities."

what common purpose can aggrable people work towards when they see their peers and mostly themselves as children, being acted upon with no agency
, now if you define cooperation as non conflicting then perhaps but, that's not cooperation

if cooperation is working towards a common goal i don't think agreeable people will beat disagreeable people at that game..... for example soldiers, police, company directors and such staff even scientists perhaps

well the thing is the more competitive you are the more cooperative you are, to compete you have to cooperate

Moreover men are much more cooperative (by the definition of working towards a common goal) than women, well there could be other explanations for that, but the highest difference in trait aggreablness is among gender would support that the higher disaggrablness is more cooperation

Each morning I ask myself what things I don't want to do but need to do in order to solve the myriad problems I have brought upon myself; taking this into account, I then write down my vision of heaven and hell for the day. Heaven is the sense of utmost accomplishment I would have were I to optimally address my problems. Hell is the complete abandonment of my goals and the backslide into depression and anxiety that would occur as a result. The thing is, I always fall short of heaven- I always fail to optimally remedy my problems to the height of my own satisfaction, and yet I still manage to slightly progress and climb a little more out of the hole I have dug for myself. Although this technically constitutes a series of failures, more times than not, I still manage to rise above hell; so, in this sense, these series of relative failures incrementally build toward success. 

Another thing I've noticed is just how similar this aforementioned concept is to making art. I am a painter, and I find painting to be just like this; it is a series of failures that end in success. Each session I am generally displeased with what I've painted, but, in modifying and layering these failures atop one another, I eventually end up with an image I am satisfied with. I am beginning to realize just how similar life is to art- that one's life really is like an art project of the most dramatic, challenging, and profound degree."

No sense trying to argue with facts unless you want to weave a permanent web of illusion. I wish the PC types would see that the emperor will never, ever have clothes even if we all believed he did."

I can say that your lectures were a true life-changer for me (and I'm sure so much people share these feelings with me!). I really would want to know your thoughts on Pierre Bourdieu and his social fields structures concepts!

Again, THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Now, excuse me, I will come back to sorting myself out haha"
