Ugymdf9Koeg5E6wk5Tt4AaABAg,Kent Nauman,1533342449789,"Concerning evil and the purpose of our existence, God is good and takes full responsibility for the creation of evil. Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. Proverbs 16:4 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. And God promises to completely remove evil.  Nahum 1:9  What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.  Revelation 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  Evil is temporarily necessary for us to have the free will necessary to create our own soul, personality, character. Evil and Hell are simply the absence of God. God = fiery, love, light, good, truth, life Deuteronomy 4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire... hell = fiery, hate, dark, evil, lies, death. 1 Corinthians 3:13 Every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire (God); and the fire shall try every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) of what sort it is. 1 Corinthians 3:14  If any man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 1 Corinthians 3:15  If any man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself (spirit, mind, consciousness) shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 1 Peter 1:17  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character), pass the time of your sojourning (temporary residence) here in fear: Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men (spirit, mind, consciousness) once to die (separate from God like Adam), but after this the judgment:(the Krisis of rejoining God) Revelation 20:14  And death (separation from God) and hell (negative God) were cast into the lake of fire (God). This is the second death. (separation from an evil soul, personality, character).  Revelation 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire (God) and brimstone: which is the second death.(separation from an evil soul, personality, character)  Revelation 21:4  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death (separation from God), neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. But Matthew 16:26 For what is a man (spirit, mind, consciousness) profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul (soul, personality, character)? or what shall a man (spirit, mind, consciousness) give in exchange for his soul (soul, personality, character)? Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man (spirit, mind, consciousness), if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul (soul, personality, character)?"

Nothing is on display here other than the speakers extreme mental illness. The speaker has deep need to have other people dislike him, thereby reaffirming his own low opinion of himself. . So this doofus references the book 'The Denial of Death' and yet somehow doesn't inform anyone of anything . . . it's not voluntary exposure that cures people. . it is understanding, or figuring it out for themselves. . perhaps this is because we have a deep seated distrust of others. . if we got this knowledge from others, we'd have a harder time believing it or accepting it. . if we figure it out for ourselves . .

What we see happening here, ISN'T a teacher, showing his pupils where all the on topic information can be obtained; which works from all sides are considered relevant to the topic, AND, most of all: How to make up your own mind, form your own opinion RATIONALLY, without committing any reasoning _fallacies . 
Teachers are there to teach their pupils HOW to think; HOW to draw conclusions as rational and unbiased as possible, instead of telling them WHAT to think. 

This supposed cultural Marxist conspiracy he sees everywhere, seems to have turned him into a Don Quixote, fighting the windmills of a threat that ain't there, while totaly ignoring the one that does exist (namely: Subjective fundamentalist faith-based us against them beliefs, being far more threatening than anything else (polarization, in short, and Peterson, in his public appearances (as a book-salesman), is doing nothing but polarizing, using the same dreaded Identity Politics , he's at the same time supposedly agitating against.

Ugy5ESlgrHS-nPiM9Nd4AaABAg,Goldie Tamamo,1528072069129,"Moral zoology, baby. It ain't a single unified solution, it's an entire ecosystem of relatively beneficial functions, with the compromise between the group and the individual as a constant matter of instinctive negotiation.

A functional Morality would look indistinguishable from good ecology. Circulation, flow, freedom of movement, perpetual growth and division and diversification, punctuated by very minor, controlled, predicted collapses and failures.

... the problem is that the direction of the absolute truth is a heading borne toward change, chaos, and collapse. God is a being of freedom, and order is the tool for pulling him up from the earth like a well-spun vase. This is why your absolute truth-seekers inevitably veer into a nosedive toward suicidal ideation and entheogenic experiences, before (ideally, anyway,) breaking from this trajectory and amassing their own set of relative, personal truths.

Some degree of loss is necessitated, which is why the greedy utopia cannot break free from the mud to begin with."

It was a literary movement manufactured by tortured artists who had an audience among themselves in the 50s & 60s and complained about nausea, angst, boredom, etc. so that they claim what sensitive souls they were to bear the harsh absurdity of existence now that one of their own academic sherpa/guru had said, ""God is dead.""  The general public never really caught on to all the hype about God's demise.  It was a intellectual fad that had come and is now gone.

Religion is still in full force, despite the fears of secularization.  The 60s, of which you read Walter Kaufman, was freaked out about the decline in religion, especially Christianity.  There was the death of God religious movement in Protestantism, the atheism of Communism, the rise of secularism with the sciences, etc.  However, the death of God is overly exaggerated."

I have thought about the nature of pain a bit but I doubt that thought is worth much consideration. Even so, I wrote a few lines on what I think pain is or at least what some part of it is. Here goes:

Pain is that thing which distances oneself from all that is good and enjoyable. It precludes all good. No food tastes sweet; no music moves; no caress excites. It is a form of death.

I know from my own experience of severe pain that nothing that I normally would enjoy or crave or phantasize about is worth a damn. 

Ok, so now I have thrown this out. Probably not the smartest thing I have done today but it’s not like I have worse things to do and it might spur a conversation. If not I’ll risk the projectiles flung toward me."

A.K.: According to encyclopedias, Kierkegaard is supposed to have been the first ""existentialist"" philosopher. But what does that even mean? When was there ever a philosopher who didn't concern himself with existence? That's all that philosophers are concerned with! because they are concerned with everything, and there IS nothing else apart from existence! Do these people who create these utterly retarded labels ever read anything? All the issues with which K-man was concerned have been mulled over by philosophers for millennia, and if you look closely enough you'll not find a single idea in him that had not already been explored to one degree or another by numerous previous thinkers (and in plenty of cases to a much greater depth than him). There is no ""existentialism"", there are only a bunch of mouthbreathing subhumans who are too stupid to deal with the actual issues at hand, and who therefore prefer to make neat little bunches of them by blanketing them with retarded makeshift labels, and then proceed to juggle those instead so that they won't ever have to think about anything. Even ""postmodernism"" is a more valid label than existentialism, and that's saying something!"

While adressing the problems of the 'here and now' may seem more important than adressing the problems of 'the afterlife', consider the following:

1) If you actively start working on a better afterlife, and not passively wait around for it, you'll probably get there faster than if you constantly try to solve your short-term problems. There will always be more problems in the short term, that's what the legend of Sisyphus tells. 

Those who chase around their momentary problems (the fix, the game) end up costing time and energy of those who are working on the better future. This results in a negative attitude, with fatalism and shifting the blame in the mix. Because, when you find out that you can't solve every problem on your own, you might tend to blame others, instead of yourself. Resulting in violence, in words or in deeds. Slight nod to WWII here.

The Christian faith combats this by telling people not to WAIT for heaven, it tells people to actively WORK TOGETHER on making the place that they inhibit more Paradise-like. Working together requires coördination, compassion and some sacrifice, resulting in peace.


2.) Don't forget that Nietschze was probably a very unhappy person most of his life. He did a lot of drugs, was never married, and suffered a mental breakdown at 44. His life story seems to not have been a stable, and it's important to take this into consideration when you contextualize his work."

UgwgEcVzJXjgM2z5-l94AaABAg,Java Monkey,1504484986566,"Something I find profoundly sad is the fact that the popular notion of Nietzsche's philosophy is essentially the exact opposite of what Nietzsche actually believed and wrote about.

This is partly, I suppose, due to the meddling of his appallingly malicious and antisemitic sister and brother-in-law's handling of his estate (to whom, in life, Nietzsche wrote many a strongly worded letter of condemnation). 

It's also partly due to the fact that his points go over the vast majority of people's heads - particularly the edgy teenagers who purport to be his devout followers.

One of the worst misunderstandings is that he's seen as the father of Nihilism (when, in fact, he was warning against its impending advent). The other colossal misunderstandings - which is perhaps much more damaging - is the concept of the Übermensch. Most people take it to mean that the strong, ruthless, and amoral are superior and have free reign to tyrannize everyone else - the Üntermenschen. In reality, he saw traditional morals and values rapidly decaying with the belief systems that held them in place, and that one must craft their values for themselves. One of those he thought up for himself was the (metaphorical) notion that time is circular, and that he should live his life as if he would have to relive it in the same way endlessly - so he should avoid actions that would result in suffering or regret.

A brilliant man, misunderstood by the masses."

I was always interested in art and philosophy, and the fallenness of the society as a construct and the  predicament of living and desperately trying to thrive in its consumptionism stricken reality. I suppliment my search with videos of Eric Dodson and reading Anthony De mello's Awakening, and  all of this combined teaches me to first observe and dissect everything i come in contact with, including myself and my reactions, emotions and psychological patterns, and only then form an opinion and an approach to it. . So far i have only come in contact with existentialist philosophy, but i  find it very difficult to believe  that i'll ever find a branch of philosophy more fitting for my life ( and im sure many of us feel like that, given that the universality and relevance of a work/idea system in lives of many people is a telltale sign of it's ingeniousness) I truly would suggest taking a deep, inquisitive  look into the amazing, elaborate scope of views and analysis that Mr.Peterson presents us with in his videos. As a prospective 21 year old university student from Poland , i can only say that at this point it is my greatest dream to sometime get a chance to listen to Mr.Peterson's lectures in person, preferably as a psychology/philosophy minor at uni of Toronto :)

She chose a path, and went down it like a thunderbolt. Yet Joan, when I came to think of her, had in her all that was true either in Tolstoy or Nietzsche, all that was even tolerable in either of them. I thought of all that is noble in Tolstoy, the pleasure in plain things, especially in plain pity, the actualities of the earth, the reverence for the poor, the dignity of the bowed back. Joan of Arc had all that and with this great addition, that she endured poverty as well as admiring it; whereas Tolstoy is only a typical aristocrat trying to find out its secret. And then I thought of all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor Nietzsche, and his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time. I thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger, his hunger for the rush of great horses, his cry to arms. Well, Joan of Arc had all that, and again with this difference, that she did not praise fighting, but fought. We KNOW that she was not afraid of an army, while Nietzsche, for all we know, was afraid of a cow. Tolstoy only praised the peasant; she was the peasant. Nietzsche only praised the warrior; she was the warrior. She beat them both at their own antagonistic ideals; she was more gentle than the one, more violent than the other. Yet she was a perfectly practical person who did something, while they are wild speculators who do nothing. It was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she and her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility that has been lost. And with that thought came a larger one, and the colossal figure of her Master had also crossed the theatre of my thoughts"" ~ Chesterton"

What 'killed God,' was not a conscious effort,  but rather by the Church's own effort of attempting to prove their leaders divinity through scientific inquiry. If we're searching for the smoking gun, all we have to do is look at Descartes - it was his philosophy of doubt that caused us to search relentlessly for something that wasn't there. AND WE CAN NEVER GO BACK. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say that this is a war between ideologies, which, in some ways, it might be.

Are the 'existentialist explanations'(?) regarding Terror Managment Theory and behavioural learning your own? Are there any publications that I can read?"

The brutality of history is irrational, and somehow that means we can't use rationality ourselves to understand it? It doesn't make sense; it's like it gets confused about what even the definition of the word ""irrational"" is.

And then there's one about, you can't use rationality for everything because there's too much complexity, so you need to use emotions and other decision-making strategies. Well yes, of course that's true in practice, but that's supposed to be a criticism of rationality itself? There is no tenant of rationality that states or implies that one must try to solve every challenge by cold logical deduction.

Reminds me of the common, totally misconceived criticism of economists, that they think people should only care about money. It's a totally silly and confused idea, like if you tried to criticize plumbers ""because they think everything should be solved with pipes"". Just some sort of fallacy where people assume there's an ideology where there actually isn't one, I guess. I think that's the same thing that's happening here with rationality.

We crave it and the fact that we do frightens us to the very bone. When I lose meaning in life I find my self, consciously or subconsciously, desiring hardship. I never could make sense of it until recent. Suffering gives life meaning. Not because we find satisfaction in It, but because it allows us to recognize, by contrast, of the beauty and joy in life when it's right in front of our faces.

Science provides hope as well for man's misery, contributes to a great standard of living and allows him to live longer than any other time in history.  You are creating a religion in some respects woven together from many different sources, perhaps just like the different tribal stories have contributed to the totality of the old testament narrative.  You are spinning a comprehensive yarn drawn from many sources.  You are a prophet who has seen God's miracles and cures, though you can point to no God.

Thsi professor doesn't seem to master what he's talking about. Here are two examples.
It is essentially wrong to reduce existential anxiety to something similar to the experience of a rat put in a new cage or a child left alone. In both these situations it is an instinctual fear in which one 'loses oneself', that is where one has a very low level of self-consciousness. Existential anxiety on the other hand stems from an acute awarneess of self as being here, and is not accessible to an animal. 
The idividualism shared by the existentialists has nothing to do with the methodology in the social and human sciences of the same name. It expresses a moral concern, the importance of developing a self-counsciousnes and an inwardness, freeing onself from the group so as to live an authentic life.

They just don't like to get their hands dirty doing the actual grunt work.

Whereas conservatives, in my experience, just quietly help people without making a big deal about it, without demanding public recognition and applause. Mother Teresa is a case in point. She was just focused on dealing with the one person who needed help that was in front of her, whereas many organizations and celebs criticize her for not spending more time being a public activist to raise money and get the world involved--which again, is easy to do than actually helping the poor, sick, and homeless on a personal level."

I am very haltingly and ineptly reworking myself in the light of professor Peterson's insight. as a student  I wished I could converse with the ghosts of Neitzsche Kropotkin and  Darwin ( and Hegel. I would love to see Peterson  lecture on him but probably way off topic) . in being able to recieve the professor's lecture I feel my wish has been exceeded. ( would also be interested in Peterson's thoughts on Kropotkin. As a very old school anarchist what still attracts me to the school of thought is the insistence on individual responsibility as method and goal . on individual empowerment likewise. it is a doctrine in many ways more utopian than the 57 flavours of Marxism. but intellectually if not organisationally I find the refusal to install blueprints for utopia and the insistence that this can only be achieved by the combined self activity of all the people to be more honest and powerful. socialism not as state ownership plus electrification but as the ability of all to work as they choose without impediment beyond the consequences of their personal error or incompetence or that of the collective to which they have freely affiliated. I am not optimistic for this in this day ( Though must study the experiments in libertarian municipalism,embattled but ongoing in Rojava etc. )and so feel classical liberalism to be the least of evils in most cases( by which I mean classical liberalism as embraced by the early British Trade Unions where political liberalism was combined with mutual aid and democratic collective  self organisation , before they marched down the blind alley of the oh so well intentioned labour party. I find we are back in the place of Aristophanes' ' the Birds' where democracy with all its utopianism and failings remains a precious jewell amidst all kinds of repressive totalitarian onslaught. yet is lost between on the one hand a petty self serving  nihilism and on the other a dogmatic resentful hypocritical moralism. )
I suppose the anarcho- democratic myth is the last survivor which might Allow an honest approach to organising life so that the individual may struggle to become whatever he wants to be with the best chance of the intelligence allowing this to be available and the impediments against this being minimal. But then what do I know. my moral compass was formed by NTV's 'Monkey' and 'The water margin'  with a little Pilgrims progress and a bit of Rev John Ball  and some romance of the 3 kingdoms on the side. with bits of Homer Plutarch and Thucydides informing .

For canines, as far as we can tell, their sense of smell (which, neurologically speaking, is orders of magnitude more sensitive than humans, literally dogs have way more olfactory neurons than humans do, and humans have way more optical neurons than canines) is a way of taking in the world and in a sense seeing, so for dogs smelling is like vision. So it doesn't follow that just because someone has 20/20 vision they would never want to go outside because the sun is shinning and there are a lot of things to look at.

UgglQAbb1_TWe3gCoAEC,Digital Dakini,1504485036835,"Shantideva said, ""Moreover, suffering has good qualities"". And as you know the first Noble Truth is ""All existence is suffering"". Since suffering is pervasive, changing and manifest it goes without saying that we are surrounded with an infinite source of that which those of us who know at the core of us is inevitable, and therefore if voluntarily accepted can achieve the ""goal"". As. a Buddhist we call that enlightenment, but we do tend towards over simplicity of mere labels. Enlightenment in its broad sense it to become awakened, and I would hazard a guess that all philosophies have that same goal. It is through understanding the nature of suffering, the nature of experiencing that suffering that we can voluntarily accept that suffering. An anecdote: when I experienced the pains of labour I voluntarily endured that physical pain knowing that at the end of it I would have a new life, but in accepting that pain I gained much more than that. I discovered in that pain I had the ability to focus my mind, without distraction, on that experience, being a meditator that was fascinating, useful beyond measure and awakening. I experienced an understanding that this pain could be the cause of my death, and in accepting that gained a small insight into that which most of us are so terrified we never dare to venture into thinking about. Our own mortality. We are gong to die. Definitely. Permanently! And in that knowledge of what others might view as great suffering an invaluable gift was given to me. Poverty, endured voluntarily brought a degree of contentment. Loneliness, voluntarily accepted brought introspection, deep levels of thought and understanding.

Enlightenment."
UgifN_HyuKyUZHgCoAEC,William Koscielniak,1504485036847,"When I was younger Nietzsche was basically my God and ""Notes From Underground"" was basically my bible. The impact that Nietzsche and Dostoevsky have had on my soul is, well, indescribable. Kierkegaard was also important, because I had a genocidal hatred of Christianity and thinking of men like Kierkegaard and Martin Luther King helped make it possible for me to not totally fall off the cliff and explode. I was a sick, sick nihilist back in the day. And I've just always been obsessed with the movement these three men created. Something was happening in Europe in the mid to late 19th century and these three more than any others picked up on it and communicated it to the world."

UgjE2daxdvDhvHgCoAEC,Thijs Visser,1504485047623,"Did anyone else also think of the new headquarters of apple when the 'palace of crystal' (1:32:18) was mentioned? 
""Suffering is unthinkable"" seems almost a reasonable slogan for their products (althought not for the people working in factory jobs in foreign contries who produce their iphones and ipads).

So possibly what apple really tries to sell is a sliver of utopia with its products.
""Buy this product and all your worries and anxieties will disappear!""

Also the promise of immortality by the singularity by people in silicon valley is a almost a grotesk rejection and denial of what is to be human.

Now I see how not accepting vulnerability can lead to catastrophic outcomes in a multiplicity of ways. And no amount of technological, economical or political safety can eradicate or suspense with vulnerability. But maybe we should have enough safety to retreat to when the chaos of the unknown (or chaos as such) becomes too much too bear.

God this ickyness about technolical solutions has been at the tip of my tong or to quote the matrix like a splinter in my mind for maybe even a decade. As an engineering student it is such a relief to finally figure this out."

There is a significant uptick in Christian growth in the youth of all demographics and in tyrannical environments like China.  Christianity has never suffered this foretold demise.  What happened is the dead letter of the law swallowed up the spirit of the law as it's ultimate expression because it is easy to replace living vibrancy with inflexible bylaws and mores.  This doppelganger paraded itself around in costumes bedding kings, bedding commerce, bedding military forces, and extending it's power by proxy.  This monster died and needed to die.  Science never replaced religion because science does not posses the hardware for meaning.  It's not just truth that Christianity exalts.  It is truth and meaning.  There are things that are true that does not move the needle.  Get behind a podium and recite traffic statistics.  No one will care.   Christianity makes the case that God is true and MEANINGFUL!  Buddhists believe in gods or devas, but don't place great importance on them, so that is not the central feature in their religion.  It's there but not coveted.  Christianity aims to illustrate that God is true and that truth is not important, it is absolutely irreplaceable and crucial to all things good and right."

UghD2fCQ9ImTLHgCoAEC,Vishal Gill,1504485056160,"Question for Jordan Peterson?

   I have been doing a lot of research and development into the meaning of life and I have come to an ultimatum. Suicide is the “rational” response to life. Even great minds like Solomon, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy arrived at this conclusion. Homo sapiens sapiens, on our small planet, in a small galaxy, in a seemingly infinite universe, don't matter. An individual human life, averaging 80 years means nothing in a universe that will last 100’s of billions of years. And let’s not even get into parallel universes, higher dimensions and determinism. Not to mention the fact that, life is suffering. In his book Confession, Tolstoy says

“So that besides rational knowledge, which had seemed to me the only knowledge, I was inevitably brought to acknowledge that all live humanity has another irrational knowledge — faith which makes it possible to live. Faith still remained to me as irrational as it was before, but I could not but admit that it alone gives mankind a reply to the questions of life, and that consequently it makes life possible. “

   It has been many years and I am still stuck in a state of ennui and apathy. How can one hypocritically embrace irrationality and faith when it is rationality in the first place that brought me here? How can a conscious man be anything more than a man like the one Dostoyevsky described in Notes from Underground?
