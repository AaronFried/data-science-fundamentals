Ugx08Zc_pqzfZxbY7BZ4AaABAg,Michael Ockerby,1525393761751,"Be warned with creative pursuit and talent in creative production; the insidious acts fuelled of envy and jealousy by others may destroy you. Even within the immediate familial environment, a jealous mother or farther will bring you down if you don't fully comprehend human nature and have the ability and fortitude of character to deal with it; simply for the reason that it (true creativity) is so rare, and the great majority of humanity are not!!! - many are competitive, and will see any light as an affront on their status. Learn the arts of War, and commit to fight for your creative pursuit and ownership of what your create. ""The envious hides as carefully as the secret, lustful sinner and becomes the endless inventor of tricks and stratagems to hide and mask himself. Thus he is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of others which eats up his heart, as if he did not see them, nor hear them, nor were aware of them, nor had ever heard of them. He is a master simulator. On the other hand he tries with all his power to connive and thus prevent any form of superiority from appearing in any situation. And if they do, he casts on them obscurity, hypercriticism, sarcasm and calumny like the toad that spits poison from its hole. On the other hand he will raise endlessly insignificant men, mediocre people, and even the inferior in the same type of activities"" : Arthur Schopenhauer, 1788 - 1860...""Know how to triumph over envy and malice. Here contempt although, prudent, counts, indeed, for little; magnanimity is better. A good word concerning one who speaks evil of you cannot be praised too highly: there is no revenge more heroic than that brought about by those merits and attainments which frustrate and torment the envious. Every stroke of good fortune is a further twist of the rope round the neck of the ill -disposed and the heaven of the envied is hell for the envious. To convert your good fortune into poison for your enemies is held to be the most sever punishment you can inflict on them. The envious man dies not only once but as many times as the person he envies lives to hear the voice of praise; the eternity of the latter's fame is the measure of the former's punishment: the one is immortal in his glory, the latter in his misery. The trumpet of fame which sounds immortality for the one heralds death for the other, who is sentenced to be choked to death on his own envy"" : Baltasar Garcia, 1601 - 1658. Notice that this is the way envious people see creative people and their production; a source of power, a source of status fame, glory. Most creative people don't give a fuck about that, they just want to make the world a better place, make the world a little easier, give a little bit more beauty and poetry to experience......a conflict of interest, and one you would do well to study if you a preparing creative things."

This also means that the creativity of your personality *can change after you die*. Would anyone accept that Van Gogh become more creative in death than life? Because by this measure that is what happened.
i.e. We are more interested in fluid intelligence over crystallized intelligence - where are the fluid creativity measurements?"

So, even if an idea is not very original, it can work if it is shown in the right place, at the right time, with the right people. But i think is not luck at all, but great social skills and, as you say, the ability to climb up through hierarchies. So a not so original idea could be succesful, despite the inherent risk, knowing what is the right place to show it, the right time to do it and the right people to talk to.

Ugxqcr-dLBRkdUsLS5d4AaABAg,Curt Howland,1515025772236,"Dr. Peterson makes only one mistake in this lecture, and it's where economics is concerned.

The repeat iterative game that does not lead to one owning everything and everyone else owning nothing is free trade and unregulated markets. That is because each individual owns themselves, and their own production, to trade as they wish. This is inalienable, since chattel slavery was abolished.

Unregulated trade only occurs when both parties to the trade want it to happen. If either party, or any party, to the trade does not think they gain from that trade, the trade does not happen. That means with every trade people's wealthy grows. People are better off, poverty is lessened or eradicated.

That's why as governments have lessened their interference with trade, poverty has decreased. Dr. Peterson goes into this with his observation elsewhere that the U.N. goal of ""cutting poverty in half"" was accomplished faster than even the most optimistic projections.

This is because free trade builds on itself, wealth increases faster as time passes and faster the less interference in trade that governments exercise.

That's how even the poorest people of Hong Kong became the envy of the world from nothing in only a couple decades: Maximum freedom of trade."

Just because you work and make a lot of money doing what you do doesn't ensure success and happiness. Maybe there is a reason our society is failing.

He is definitely put out there to propagate such thinking but it's really a red herring. He says you can't help coming to a 1% in a system like we have so too bad. He excuses as if it's okay, because it naturally happens everytime. The system is indeed designed against you, but you actually have 0 chance of becoming part of the 1%. Those spots are reserved for the elite families, the cabal families of kabbalist jewish bankers and royal families. The system is the problem and we can do something about it. The answer lies in denying overarching hierarchical power structures. Get rid of the UN and any other big hierarchical institution and keep every governing entity so small that you could have a cup of coffee with everyone in your community. Corruption takes place among strangers and a limited government system would prevent or at least greatly increase the chance of cutting corruption at it's root before it can take hold. It would mean that the human communities would bear more risk and responsibility but with the reward that freedom is more easily conserved should someone or a group try to take more power then necessary. It beats the promise of the dystopian future that awaits us now. The geopolitical drama is all for show. Whats really happening is that your mind is being socially engineered while they build a digital prison around you.

  As for immigration,  it is a great thing! Providing it is done legally I don't see how anyone has a problem with that. 

    Having a healthy boundary around a cell is important at controlling what comes in and out to keep the cell working and healthy. Setting healthy boundaries with your children to establish lines that, if crossed, will result in a consequence, is important and having a line around a country, that is crossed, will result in consequence is also Important.

You could just as easily call it ascribed value, or whatever type of thing the dictionary says. I suppose it also involves recourse to relativity, communication skills and things that would underly a fancy term, a factor like perceptual versatility. I suppose the real Meaning of meaning itself is Experience? or idk. Love is so beyond us, it seem like it might be a big part, if not all of what keeps things going. With enough perceptual versitility, after all, a mind could perhaps bend to see anything as a manifestation of love. What a tricky idea tho, maybe there's another word for that, but it sounds about right. It just seems like an easy term to get carried away with.

Obviously some products are much harder such as social networks or things like trello or inventing a new personality test or creating a new english certification, those are all things that benefit from many people already using them. For most other products the best strategy, after the free trial which only works for software, is to spend money marketing the product by giving it to influencers and paying them to promote it, be it beauty products, clothing, a new car brand, new computer hardware company... but this is VERY expensive and can still be incredibly hard.

It's not just a matter or hard work or of opportunity. Those things are essential, of course, but it's also the predisposition to intelligence and creativeness that affords us success.

Narratives that don't include this natural bias are flawed. The concepts of the ""American Dream"" that implies hard work is the only factor needed to gain success or the Communist idea that equity in distribution of resources will resolve discrepancy and corruption both lack the insight into the way our nature trends towards. So recognition in your own shortcomings and your own advantages can help unravel the extremes of dogma and instead focus on the immediacy of your own journey to a relative success, bounded by your own definitions. Underpinning all of this is liberty ‚Äìboth personal and social‚Äì that allows your to creative a narrative. If you aren't scoring 60 on the CAQ, maybe it means you won't be the next creative genius, but it certainly doesn't stop you from writing a poem or a novel, designing your new living room, or inventing solutions to your problems.

Typical function of the state: when not ridden with greed. Invests i local artists. NO Migration, NO globalization.

This allows the standard of the builders and contractors and rule of law, to still take a meaty portion of society monies, but the taxation, also allows permanent and low income to artists. i.e., 20 -30k Easily. Which is very livable. 
He is right this comic world of theft, takes everything and your soul and kills you. Met a famous potter, he made on average 6k a year. I made in the last ten years, under 100k in a first world country, about 3k-8k a year, that covers food, and rent. This allows no mate, no future, but I discovered many things.  Not completely lazy, because I sid it was an average, I did do work and work up north, the most I made n one month was 17k. Some years, I made nothing paying for my student loans. So our nation is under attack and swarmed by people that are not our people. I ma fucking tired of this inclusive nature, while they steal knowledge to pervert it towards PRIVATE and teach Private ownership and control of al things, create a very unkind society. SO i think He is still off.

Greed the plan of ruin. 

Coming out of a violent commerce war. The assets of the republic were devastated and stolen. Now the world has adopted HItler societies and destroyed a society built on honesty and love. HItler used the government to profit from his book, clearly there is no virtues invested in him. Then we have all the reverse psychology today forcing people to run into capital predators and allowing their children to fall prey to large sexual markets filled with some sort of sickness.

I'm almost 30, an artist, and tried to find something else to do as a career until a year ago. I went on various courses, between different jobs, ending, ironically with the first year of a Psychology degree which left me unsatisfied and frustrated. I was absolutely miserable when I was spending my time focusing on other things because I am high in conscientiousness so I felt that I had to put all my effort and focus into them, leaving me with nowhere near enough time to do my art. Now I'm studying illustration and animation and have never been happier in my life. I have a true sense of fulfilling my purpose and I experience profound feelings of meaningfulness.

I think maybe your strategy may work for some people, but for me and perhaps people like me, it didn't help. Then again maybe I just didn't find the right job to make my living, which is another difficulty. Maybe life will be difficult for me, although it seems like the animation and comic book industry are at least somewhat better to find work in than if I'd studied something like fine art.

UggZEidYCDQYxngCoAEC,anab0lic,1504485024129,"As someone who had extraordinarily high levels of creativity as a teen and in my early 20's I'm not so sure it was because I got lucky genetically, I believe its 100% down to the things I grew up doing from a very young age to a young adult.   And i bet if you were to study the childhood of other people that grow up to be highly creative they likely spent large amounts of time doing similar things that developed their brains in ways that creative people are lacking.

Also, my creativity is no where near what it once was  (although still higher than the average person it would seem)  and i believe that to be because I don't spend much time these days doing the things that built it and are most likely also required to retain it.   I was literally like a human idea factory that could generate idea upon idea and then take those ideas and sculpt them further into better ideas, or combine ideas that already exist into greater ones.... all in my head visually effortlessly.    It gave me a great sense of humour as I was always thinking outside the box in ways my peer group couldn't and then transfer my thoughts into language that would create amusing visual images in others minds. 

However,  It also had negative affects on my life that other highly creative people may be able to relate to. For instance in social situations I could likely conjure multiple bad outcomes in my imagination that would be of a very vivid nature and make you hesitant to proceed for fear of them becoming reality, , which gave me social anxiety issues.  Id often put my thoughts into others heads thinking they were thinking the same.  Also at times my mind just wouldn't 'shut up' hard to relax and fall asleep when my brains just constantly generating new and interesting thoughts in my head or ones that are bad and cause worry.   Insane, often times horrific and violent nightmares have also been commonplace for me throughout my life, but there has also been many nights where I've had dreams that were so good I wish they were a reality.   I used  think some of my dreams were so unique and original if expanded upon would make for great movies.

I am curious to know if i were to partake in what i believe to be creativity building exercises again would my mind return to its former ways.... its an area I have much interest in as for both personal gain - as its incredibly rewarding to create things of value in the world (even when not paid for it) but also helping others do the same.

UgjuXKSj7haMgHgCoAEC,Brandon Schleifer,1504485031210,"What kind of brick? Some bricks have large spaces in them which would make them useful for holding small things like nails or screws. A smaller brick, such as a straightforward clay-red rectangular prism, it's relatively low weight and simple surfaces make it great for arts and crafts.
