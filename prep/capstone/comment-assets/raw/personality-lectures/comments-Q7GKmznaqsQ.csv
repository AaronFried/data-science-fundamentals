Telling big boss it'll make him 30,000 richer per employee per year is just the promise of a salesperson, which has no weight. Here you have a test with no reputation, very little exposure, isn't widely used - things don't sell for what they're worth, they sell for what people will pay for them. True of commerce, stocks, anything. A steel Co. Could say ""our steel is going to make you planes that will carry 450,000 passengers in a life cycle so we want x percentage of what that's worth."" not gonna work. But if you sell for what people will pay and incentivize them for trying your test you can build a reputation. Reputation is what you can sell at a premium. So, yes that's why 92% of profits go to people who can sell stuff, otherwise your product is just going to sit on a shelf, essentially a prototype."

Ugzu5yUnI92I82VFipJ4AaABAg,Curt Howland,1515025814937,"There are two things wrong with applying the Perado Distribution model results to economic activity in the ""real world"" even if it works in the games. Dr. Peterson addresses this elsewhere when he points out that poverty is decreasing dramatically world wide. A Parado distribution would make such a thing impossible. So what is really going on?

1) The games are involuntary, trade is voluntary. 
2) The games are zero-sum, trade is positive sum.

So in the game, flip a coin and the person getting tails loses $1 and cannot say no, while the person getting heads gains $1. That's zero-sum, one person's gain is another person's loss.

Actual trade only occurs if both parties want it to occur. To get the buyer's money, the seller must offer something the buyer values more than the price, at the same time that the seller values the price more than what is offered.

Both win. Both believe they are better off after the trade than before the trade, or the trade would not have occurred. Net wealth has increased.

Repeat this positive-sum fact in every transaction, from penny candy to a cargo ship full of containers of who-knows-what, and the reality of the economic engine becomes clear. Every restriction, every tax, every tariff, every trade barrier, decreases the positive results of trade, and creates or perpetuates poverty.

If you want the world to be a better place, start by tearing down trade barriers, restrictions, and regulations everywhere, about everything."

UgyN6SX9Kb5SARODlIV4AaABAg,Ali Havens,1507077021984,"The idea of a personality test that one can fail seems totally useless and here's why. Personality tests, including the Big 5, rely on self-reporting. The point is to give honest accurate information about myself to see how I fit into this framework of categorizing people. The point of an interview is to sell my skills and positive qualities to get the best position possible and bending the truth is not only common but somewhat expected. We all know to say ""too perfectionistic"" when asked what our biggest weakness is regardless of how perfectionistic we are.  If I took a personality test the way I take interviews I would score much higher for conscientiousness than if I'm simply trying to understand my personality better for my own self-awareness and understanding. What you see as a strength of The Big 5 I consider a flaw: the personality characteristics measured are clearly more along the lines of good vs bad than is the case with Jung's theories about personality type.

UgwhG3KH9-N2ExBmMW54AaABAg,CrystaTiBoha,1504485025075,"Normal distribution maximizes entropy for given mean and variance.
Exponential distribution maximizes entropy for given mean and lower bound. In physics we call the exponential distribution of particles in the spectrum of energies Boltzmann distribution.
What you can see in the animation is that first the people with money haven't had much time to trade so the money distribution was limited mostly by variance ('how much money have you had enough time to lose'). As the trading progresses, the lower bound ('you can't have less than zero, but you can return from zero to positive amounts') constraint  becomes dominant.
A corollary would be that increasing the wealth IS THE SAME as increasing inequality. Reducing the variance of the exponential distribution is only possible by making everyone poor, unproductive, etc."

The value of labor at the lower end drops to zero or even negative values when you loose your social welfare benefits at certain levels.

So JBP always mentions people high in neuroticism in a context that they are anxious or depressed most of the time, or react to certain situations inadequately. Soooo, does it mean that ppl that are high in trait neuroticism were just unlucky to be born high in this trait and doomed to suffer more than those who score low on this specific trait?! Can people high in neuroticism shift this trait closer to the balance or being even low on neuroticism?

They protect their own and hold up spears to impositions of blind processes. Their allegiance is split unevenly . Forty percent goes to the company they work for, but sixty percent goes for their employee, their troops.  This sounds like incompetence but THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.  

Tests do not inspire performance, LEADERS DO.  Part of what makes a good manager is the the willingness to look out for their troops while holding them accountable.   We all worked under the ""the new sheriff in town"".  The guy or gal who loves telling you that you are not indispensable and that there are a healthy pool of applicants waiting to take your place.  They love issuing warning.  They savor moments when they can let a person know that the company has a mandate to get rid of dead weight.  They love to see your heart beat through your chest.  Theses types get reassigned.  They are tough IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!  Good managers are like good generals.  They build up their employees.  They favor them.  However they do not let them command, it is given to the manager to command. They set the agenda.  The best managers push back against upper management.  Sometimes they have to fold, but they boast about their resistance and THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO SO!  This inspires loyalty and respect.

Napoleon worked over a bunch of run down, complacent, peace time, often part time, disillusioned soldiers.  He inspired them to be the terror of Europe by dressing in the same uniform as them.

UgiyOuCx-V--AngCoAEC,bob smith,1504485072142,"1:02:50 I think this is a point that most people will completely gloss over and is actually really important to consider. The economy of America post WW2 was just absolutely filled to the brim with high paying jobs that required basically zero education, expertise or experience to do. Basically it just completely obliterated the standard selection forces that are usually operating on a population, that those that reproduce TEND to be the ones who are actually smart, hard working, have basic self control and planning for the future, that sort of thing. NOT SO in 1940 and 50's America. Basically any fat retard who had the ability to not drink themselves to death could get by just fine and still have plenty of money time and social opportunities to pass on their disgusting genes to the next generation.

You look at America, and Americans today in general, and it makes perfect sense. Just WHERE did all these fucking selfish unenlightened idiots come from? Answer: From our society that is just so wealthy and has so much excess that there are essentially NO barriers for ANYONE reproducing anymore. At best, about 15% of the population aren't degenerate moronic simpletons who are the offspring of degenerate moronic simpletons who had no business reproducing. You go to other countries and it's not like that. It's a much closer equilibrium split it seems to me. About half the population are actually intelligent, awake, and capable of self control, while the other half are basically borderline braindead monkey's whose sole purpose in life is to fuck and shove food in their face"

BUT, there are many options for entrepreneurs such as selling online or ebay these days. Or getting crowd funding.

1) You can approach mom & pop stores such as variety stores and leave your products on consignment. They may give you front counter space too!
2) You can manufacture small runs of your product but it might cost you a lot, say $10 for a unit that you sell for only $3. But so what? It is about testing.
3) Even big box stores have franchises which means you can approach the owner who may help you test your product in their store, including Saturday in store demo's,"

Anyone can build an audience today (Again, a lot of hard work but very doable, and ironically is exactly what you are doing right now.

I would argue that giving someone teachers would radically alter their access to information because of specializations.

It's only when the statistic is isolated to a specific demographic would it be more applicable: ""college graduates on average spend an average of 2 years at their first corporate job"" for example.

I feel like he does this a lot, like when he encourages people to pick a career path which aligns with their temperament, but not where they actually want to be in life.

One of the more compelling early chapters is on hockey players, and how most hockey players were born in the first 4 months of the year. The hypothesis is that his occurs because there is a hard break between hockey age groups starting at the beginning of the year. So you end up with January kids born in 2013 playing with December kids born in 2013.

(""Hey buckos"", ""I cleaned my room and slayed a dragon"", ""brb have to rescue dad from underworld"")

...why don't you post notes from the lectures,  share your experience (ACTUAL experiences) of executing on the things Jordan talks about, post questions of challenges you face when trying to use the thing he talks about in your life, or maybe just post some damn time stamps?

The comment section here is 100x better than 99% of comment sections on YouTube, at least it used to be, but I guess now that his audience is growing at such a staggering pace it's inevitable that the majority of people watching are just simply going to be lazy.

In any case, if you guys actually watch this because you are trying to make yourselves and the world better, then these ridiculous comments of trying to spin old jokes in new ways all the time are pretty damn useless.

Do something useless with your time if you're going to make a fucking post.

But the thing about dragons is that they can eat you. But otherwise you slip into nihilism, because lifes suffering, that's why you got to clean your room and rescue your father from the belly of the whale/the underworld, because they've sent Christ to the Gulags sunshine. You gotta slay the snake. In my estimation. Thats why you need to be high in conscientiousness and know your own capacity for evil, that's one way of thinking about it. And we just don't know the upper limits to that. So sort yourself out, dont be a bloody neo-marxist, dont be a mouthpiece for language you detest, you must ascend the set of all possible dominance hierarchy, and that's that buckos, and that's no joke."
