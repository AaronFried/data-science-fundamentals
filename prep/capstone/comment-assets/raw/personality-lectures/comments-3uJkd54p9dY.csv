UgxIdC2fT09F3Uh1rwV4AaABAg,J Veilleux,1535415713822,Thank you Dr. Peterson. I learn so much each time I listen. This is way more than psychology. It is an invitation to explore life itself.
UgzzwJZza8dzcVcCEJN4AaABAg,There is only one KEK and Pepe is his prophet,1533342113838,1:07:27 honest communication

UgwCtGj7RG-qJloY9Zl4AaABAg,Cory Williams,1528071713879,"Really loved this lecture, thank you!"
UgxCwllqa8PJoufip9t4AaABAg,Tejopala Rawls,1525393313896,The nuance and care of thought and just the damn kindness in this is really moving and truly helpful. I'm going to need to reflect on it before I can properly say why and in what ways. But thank you.
UgzJ4F3Il5H_VSWgfMd4AaABAg,martynas aukst,1522801313908,this is a very sophomoric understanding of rogers. another example of peterson's mediocrity as a teacher and all of this obscure sophistry that he claims to reject is on full display here. as soon as he gets into real life examples it is just folk wisdom.
Ugx_ucEvPI2X-W_pndF4AaABAg,refractedphoton,1520122913924,Did he say what the trivial thing that brought a tear to his eye was? I don' think he did.

UgydrsMeZxU9Kv1aI7B4AaABAg,M Shannon,1520122913946,"Anxiety, the sense or knowledge that something is wrong or not right externally and/or internally. My definition, sound ok?"
UgyM1Qj2BdrPYlDpPqZ4AaABAg,Gearsturfs,1512346913959,"This dude is massively egotistical 

Look at how little he touches on the actual persons idea 

He constantly uses his own examples in excessively verbose ways that seem more to be about playing with himself

No wonder he’s become an anti social justice celebrity"

I've always thought about this danger of diagnosing someone with a mental illness and telling them that's what they have. I think in a lot of ways mental health problems are infectious and even awareness of them can get people second guessing whether they are actually sane or not. Because in reality everyone probabaly has some kind of mental deficiency, it's part of what makes us human and imperfect. So labelling can be very detrimental in this sense. Which is why I think this push for everyone to discuss mental health more needs to be looked at with a bit of caution. We are not designed to have everyone's mental issues weighing on our conscious as well as our own. I think a better solution would be to work on giving everyone the tools to sort of win their own mental battles in their heads. I think if you're a clever person you're much more capable of overcoming issues in your head than you think, and you don't necessarily need therapists or doctors to help you (especially when those types of relationships have the tainting factor of money and corporations involved)."

UgwXoG5bUQYxWBxpXCh4AaABAg,Michel Benedetti,1504484513999,"I noticed Mr. Peterson was growing a beard when he started to approach Freud, Nietzsche Dostojewsky...pure coincidence?"
UgiXfasJahmeJHgCoAEC,John Ny,1504484514023,Wow.
Ughk9koN7QCnBHgCoAEC,bjhodge8,1504484514035,It is well known that western/greek philosophy began with the pre-socratics such as Democritus well before Plato.
UgjPttOLWDFYZngCoAEC,Kevin Jones,1504484514047,"I do hope we have 2017 Personality Lectures. With every extra year of lectures
 there seems to be an extra clarification or insight that helps me greatly."
Ugip77gJWWiKj3gCoAEC,Daniel Clement,1504484514053,"Rogers method of self actualization sounds rather harmonious, as you are listening to the bodies feedback and assuming that feedback feels good this process would be comfortable. How does this contrast with Carl Jung's exploration of the ""underworld"" in order to find oneself?"
UghFfPFC1nfdY3gCoAEC,The Pink Pistol,1504484514062,"I mean it only takes around a 15FPS moving picture for us to sense it as more than a slideshow, but our eyes can see at upwards of 250FPS. The ""flicker"" only occurs on camera footage when the refresh rate of the monitor is out of sync with the camera's shutter.

Most screens refresh at 60Hz because it's enough to convince us it's fluid when we're the ones controlling a cursor. It's the same reason movies can be filmed at 24Hz and no one cares, but if someone is forced to play a game or use a device that only refreshes 30 times a second they might get nauseous, especially up close."
Ugj9FOMapoqfdXgCoAEC,thespymachine,1504484514073,"You can tell that Peterson was trying to stay 'on track' with his lecture this time, compared to previous ones. Much slower, less covered. I like the fast and chaotic spider-web'd lectures Peterson does, though it makes sense to put some blinders on every now and then. Perhaps he did this after their exam in response to their grades or something lol"
UgiViORuuuMd5ngCoAEC,Steve Green,1504484517431,"Some of this playlist draws attention less vibrantly than he characteristically does, one just realises ranging through various approaches is necessary for a full understanding, so one tries not to wander off, lol. Parts are brilliant renditions of facets of his general theme mind, gets one back on track, roflmao."
UgjOHeVo9doppngCoAEC,René P.,1504484517443,"Fantastic! I discovered the phenomenological approach to therapy a couple of years ago, and this (and other video lectures by you) is a wonderfully clear and convincing articulation of it. 

I also have a question: where could I find the original quote by Nietzsche that you paraphrase as ""The fact that you experience thoughts is no proof that you thought them""?"
UghZ8QJ--FEaF3gCoAEC,Amit Sen,1472948517456,"I have a thought regarding the unconditional positive regard you are mentioning, that Rogers is talking about. I had quite a crisis in the mid 90ies, that I with some help from friends got through alive. Well, I don't think I would have died, but I probably would have been emotionally (and hence mentally, I believe those two go together in a much more intimate way than we generally think) impaired. This was when I was in the middle of my training to become a gestalt therapist. After the second year in my training (of a four year educations) I got some feedback that meant that I couldn't complete my training. I would have to re-take the year I had just gone through, which basically meant being in a group process with a new group for another year, while my class mates went on to the next year. I didn't fully understand my reaction at the time, but I learnt later on that a big portion of the physical pain, anxiety and general weariness was, shame. I think of shame as the affect that regulates social contact. In daily terms one would say shyness, but I've stuck with shame as the general term. I also relate this to Ericson's (E.H.) idea of basic trust and basic misstrust, where shame is an endemic misstrust of sorts. My experience after having worked for 18 years or so, is that when you go deep enough, you come to a place where people are concerned with how they will be perceived, on such a deep level that they will not risk taking that last step unless the situation is really safe. When appropriate (when my client is fully aware that the framework is a professional one) I can take the risk saying ""I will never judge you"" (I have to mean that of course, which implies acknowledging some dark places of my own of corse) and ”I will never leave you”. There is potentially a problem here, at least I thought there might be, that I will evoke ”false hope”. So far I’ve only seen positive outcomes of this. Partly I guess this has to do with me sensing if it’s appropriate for me to say something like this. But it’s not to difficult to dress this message up in a way so that it can be received without putting myself and the client in this situation. One way to ”step this down” a notch, is to play the ”what-if game” (”what if I/somebody told you …”). Well, my point here is that this is how I understand Rogers emphasis in the unconditional positive regard. (This, accidentally, leads to to the radical insight, that there can’t be evil in the world, which of course presupposes seeing even more of your own darkness and, well, Hanlons razor. :)   )
Thanks a bunch for putting all these videos out there. I really appreciate them."
UghChY010luyE3gCoAEC,Mary Austin,1472948517468,"So if you had been subjected to ""arbitrary conditions of worth"" since infancy, and your condition of worth was constantly damaged.......how could it be possible that present behavior is not created by past events?"
UgisapvBYZcf-ngCoAEC,Sevilla King,1472948517481,Would you say that Skype is or is not a prohibitive barrier to perceiving the subtleties of non-verbal communication when one is engaged in psychotherapy?
UgiZoMnB40eTBngCoAEC,J. M.,1472948517498,That camera angle makes me feel like I am Professor Peterson's dog. I keep waiting for him to give me a snausage. lol
UgiXkMbI7sh3R3gCoAEC,Rince wind,1472948517514,"I had this idea. If we take into account the evolutionary perspective, there are parts of us that still operates in the same ways as it does in an animal. That`s why learning & behaviour psychology is so usefull, it outlines these somewhat robotic parts of the human brain with great accuracy. It`s interesting to note what Rogers and the humanists say about becoming a whole human being. That would mean making the old, lower parts of the brain work with more developed higher parts of the brain. So for example; if one has irrational anxiety, one could categorize that as a function of the older parts of the brain - the non-verbal parts. Survival mechanisms  that reacts on stimuli in the enviroment, and stimuli created by the higher functions of the brain (the imaginitative capacities). 

The developed parts of our brain that deal with abstract thinking interpolates narratives of meaning on top of the non-verbal phenomena created by the lower parts. And here I think much of the problems of modern man lies. Does your verbal constructs work with, or against your non-verbal bodily, or survival functions. When there is a negative feeling in the body - does it invoke all of the higher abstract thinking capabilites? or is it detached. Does it serve any usefull function to create a whole intellectualized, abstract concept based on a feeling? I think not, it is to misuse the imaginative capabilites. What might be better is to deconstruct all abstractions so that one gets to a place of stillness where emotion can be observed directly, without invoking the higher mental abbilities. Cause I don`t believe that the survival mechanisms listen to reason, they are non-verbal after all. I believe this is the real state mindfullnes, being in the body, not trying to avoid it by trying to think a way out of it.

I`ve seen people who been very nervous before a public speech, but it did not bother them or diminish their presentation in any way. They were fine with being nervous, and said they were so out loud. This shows acceptance of the nervousness.  And that`s a great way to deal with the older parts of the brain. If one does not accept, it invokes the higher abilities - trying to find a way to escape the here & now, one part of oneself tries to escape the other, and thats pathological."
UggEbBzHcRAnM3gCoAEC,Andrius Bendikas,1472948517534,"A question that has popped in my mind is how you deal with the person who is overly sensitive and at the same time, likes to complain? For example, the tendency to complain about the situations in which he or she could have been solving the problem actively but instead, just watched the situation happen. 

One option is to let it go (is it a good one if that's the person you care about)?

Another option is telling them that maybe they should have done this or that to make situation better (but then they will get overly upset and take it as an attack on them even though from the first view, they weren't the bad guys which might put a relationship on risk)?

Third option could be asking a question ""Is there anything you could have done to improve this situation over long-term?"" Which as I was typing, seemed like the best option for me, subjectively. However, there is a huge fight between those 3."
UghBIHCfFJOu63gCoAEC,Kira Clarke,1472948517546,"At the moment I'm reading ""On Becoming a Person"" by Rogers.  He's a good writer and comes across as a very caring, thoughtful and intelligent person. I'm really enjoying the book."
Ugjgn3eg59xeongCoAEC,Moth Orchids,1472948517557,"My best friend has that she fakes all these ""seizures"" she goes to the hospital  4 times a month and I go with her and waist all this time.The doctor says there is no seizure  they don't know what the hell she is ""having"" but it's not a seizure. So now she takes very strong anxiety pills along with her epilepsy meds  for an epileptic seizure  which she hasn't had since 18 years past. And every word from her mouth is her community living is her life and she will never work Thank God"""
