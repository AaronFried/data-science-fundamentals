UgwZyTUzA5-diyLFq8N4AaABAg,carlmons,1532142784607,"""It's not possible to exist without a central ideal"" ~37:25... this is why multiculturalism can't work, and also why America is growing more divided. More and more are falling for leftist ideals, which are antithetical to basic American central ideals. Leftists are not new to the US, but leftists having numbers, acceptance and a significant voice certainly are. If you're a democrat you should think long and hard before you support leftist politicians in your party just because they're in your party. Unless you are comfortable with calling yourself a socialist (rather than the 'progressive' euphemism) you should drum these extremists in the guise of Americans out, to bring back credibility and centrist support to your party. Same goes for extremist on the right - extremists should find no place in American government. The national debate needs to return to issues and policies rather than ideals, because most of us still share basic ideals. The thought of a Socialist Democrat winning a primary anywhere in America should make any American cringe."

I definitely don't fully Grok this, but I've listened to the way he states ideas enough now that I get the gist of it and know that there's powerful meaning in it. Dr. Peterson isn't kidding when he says this is ""one Hell of an idea,"" although (in my case at least) the issue now is fully understanding it to be wowed in the same way that it blows him away. deeply ponders its meaning"
UgxfWoWQu6zvggXg6tx4AaABAg,Gavin Finley,1524280385619,"So glad to see Dr. Peterson share this story. The drama that began in the womb of Rebecca  is not just an old story from 4,000 years ago. The saga continues to this very day. Esau as a character is the hunter, the hustler, the take-you- down type. 

Jacob, although he is a shyster, a heel, is also a nurturing character. He is a man of the flocks, the gardens, the home and hearth. He is somewhat receptive to the spiritual stories coming down from the fathers. They are destined to become manifest in the family of faith at the consummation of the age. Jacob, if he is comprised of the two feuding families in the Judeo-Christian people, must wrestle with God. The time of “Jacob’s trouble” is a tie of trial and tribulation in which the people of faith must undergo refining in the crucible of the latter days. Holy history must unfold for the shifty Judea-Christian Jacob people to arrive at the promise and the glory at the end of the age. All great novels and art and music reflects the End-time drama. Even the classic fireworks festival reflects the splendor that comes at the climax of the story.

The big story of Esau is the prophecy given to him by his father. That prophecy was of his shaking off the yoke of civility imposed by his nurturing straight brother Jacob. This is already being seen as history approaches the climax of the story. Here is an essay on the children of Esau, the Edomites at the close of the age.

UgxhePWCtX_ldyt6fst4AaABAg,jack sprat,1524280385646,"In the question from the audience about Mohammedism Dr Peterson says he doesn't have an insight into it and where it all fits in. In my view you have Judaism and Dharma (Hinduism) before Christ comes in. Christ distilled is indistinguishable from what you can read in the Upanishads, although he uses the language appropriate for an unsophisticated and oppressed Levant at the time. 
This is not contingent on believing Christ came from/went back to India. Its not even actually contingent on believing he is God or really existed. Those are actually not important and do not threaten the teachings. What is key is that the Christ is a bridge between Dharma and the Abrahamic tradition. Most Hindus and Buddhists have no problem with JC as he is speaking their metaphysical language.
The reactions from Europe and the ME to Christ was to try and wrap it up in the language of the Judaism in order to contain the radical freedom of it. Thus what we have is a strange formal Christianity, but resistant in its intuitiveness.
Something to consider."

UgzpFPZC8Z-sjZFndoZ4AaABAg,Jordan Bell,1524280387640,"1:03:00 Not quite correct culturally. Reuben was the firstborn of the first wife (Leah) and Joseph was the firstborn of the second wife (Rachel). The two handmaidens are lesser wives (concubines was the term though we use that differently today) and so their children are ranked below all of the children of the two sisters/wives. 

Reubens sin disqualifies him from the right of the firstborn and this is given to Joseph as the next firstborn. The long coat signified that Joseph was the firstborn and would receive the Priesthood in their Patriarchal order.

Similarly, Jacob in buying the birthright from Esau also bought the Priesthood blessing (because they are one in the same). An interesting note there, Rebekah did not want Esau to receive this Priesthood because she knew he sold the right to Jacob AND he married two pagan women. She knew Priesthood or not, he would not raise his children in the Patriarchal Priesthood order."

Archetypally, it makes plenty of sense I think and it really does extend that Cain and Abel, Esau and Jacob idea to a new level. The idea that so much as one can desire or attempt to embody the transcendent good, one could equally embody transcendent malignancy. Sometimes it can feel like the urge to do evil is so great that it is perceived as just within the ""moment of passion""

Growing up the Christ/Satan brother idea just seemed like an alien concept that couldn't really be reconciled within the traditions the characters came from, but as a way of explaining the potential to align oneself more one way or the other as a very real thing to be wrestled with, it is more valuable an idea than I originally gave it credit."

I have been struggling with this question my whole teenage life and I’ve been terribly scared by it. It all stems from my Christian beliefs in heaven and an eternal afterlife. I worry that an infinite heaven is meaningless and it leads me to feel like there is no God or a heaven. I find it easier to say there is no God and move on, but then the idea of not existing after death terrifies me. I’m not completely insane with this idea, but when I think about it I begin to shiver. I wonder how do you cope with maybe their being a heaven and an eternal life or non existence after death. I really wish you could respond or anyone in the comment section help me with this problem."

For myself As a Christian I believe the characters in the narrative are not just archetypes but actual people (they are much more believable characters than most of those that hollywood portray) and while the writers précis their interactions and conversations nonetheless capture those characters very clearly. I would be interested to hear you spend a little more time on Laban, Leah and Rachel. So often Christians will name their daughters Rachel and more seldom Leah but it strikes me that Leah is the better person, Rachel is really the spoilt brat of the family. Leah certainly loves Jacob while I am not so sure about Rachel. Rachel perhaps takes after her father while Leah their mother - maybe. While believing that God is in control of all circumstances and uses all circumstances for His purposes (Joseph will be sent into slavery and thereby will save Egypt and surrounding peoples from famine etc) as a point of pure speculation I wonder whether Gods 'principal' purpose was that Jacob should fall in love with and marry Leah and not Rachel - much grief would have been spared and yet the Messianic line would still be maintained. There, almost as long as some of the questions!"

The deity only shows up to fight Jacob after he has received a message from Esau, and in fear let his entire house go on ahead of him so that he could sneak away in cowardice.

Then, in further cowardice, after Esau forgives him and asks to accompany him to their family home, Jacob lies about his camp being too tired to keep up, and says he'll catch up with him. Instead, he never returns home until the death of his father before the Joseph story. Esau and Jacob seem to reconcile above Isaac's body at the funeral."

There are just so many people out there who have come to understand through Peterson's lectures that life is unavoidably filled with suffering, that inequality is part of life through the Pareto Distribution, and who have come to believe that they need to go rescue their fathers from the bellies of the whales. The real issue with Peterson's work is that Postmodern Marxist Ideology offers no solution to Petersonism, and I think that is a fact that needs to be understood. I myself am a Petersonoholic, and it seems that I have to sort myself out now and orient myself toward ""The Good,"" and toward Truthfulness. I spend like a half an hour even yesterday just cleaning my room - on the edge of order and chaos, bucko! I find myself using the Canadian ""eh"" and the term ""bloody"" colloquially, and having a strong urge to read Jung and Solzhenitsyn.

My father wasn't a fan, I ended up being an amateur boxer in an attempt to make him one,  with goals of turning professional. I guess I had a romantic view of what being a boxer was, and once I got in that world I made the realization that most boxers didn't look at it the way I did and that perhaps I was naive and didn't understand the severity of the struggle to rise out of poverty and it's murky waters. I was disenchanted with boxing and life, but then I heard you and what you had to say. I've never had someone teach me so much, and care so deeply at the same time. It gets me teary eyed just thinking about it now, as my father left when I was young. I do not have a college education, and I had been struggling to find work but I have an interview for a warehouse Wednesday and I'm excited to work diligently, and honestly. You've reminded me how much I love to read. I've picked up Jung and many of his works, Freud, Nietchzhe, The Art of Memory, brave new world,  Hermeticism, math and science books aswell as mythology and Doestvsky. 
Here is something I'd like to share:

I smelled the summit air
Exhumed the winds of change
But only in my dreams 
Woken to distorted thoughts 
Could not recall it's means 
And once again I reached the peak 
But woke and fell in doubt 
I call to mind seraphic gleams
A God riding his mount 

I had a dream I was in a Mexican mall as a child where everyone was complaining about Trump. (I voted Trump)
Suddenly, The stage changed 
And I see a scene in which a hero is running deep in the heart of a forest, seeking someone. There is Christ, in a metallic Cross, with blue and red wires infused in his veins. He is dying.. But the hero is seeking him only to find himself outside a black mansion. He enters to find a man in a black suit, handsome and cunning. They engage in battle but the man tranquilizes the hero and he suddenly begins to fade..
As he fades, the adversary laughs and presses a button. 
The veins of Christ.. The wires.. pumping.. And it spreads all over the body until he explodes blood.. The adversary tells the hero that it was a trap. That he shouldn't have tried to save God.
I wake up.. hanging on a cross.. blue and red wires in my veins. Half my face is peeled off, replaced with cybernetics. I can't tell if I'm Christ, but I can tell that I am now the hero I was seeing, I see the world through his eyes and feel all of his suffering. It's so strange, so much deep physical torment, but a transcendence of calm. I close my eyes.. And I see a new scene. An island outside the Forest which is in bystanding island aswell. It is full of animated characters of my childhood. Pokemon, Yugioh, cartoons and such. They are having fun and playing around, when one of them senses me in the middle of the woods. I feel them and they feel me.. And like loyal dogs they come chasing for me.. without so much as a second thought, They come to rescue me. I warn them not to.. that once they arrive the adversary well press his button. The woods are on fire, and the animations fight off machines attempting to reach me in the cross. I feel like we need a miracle..
The dream fades back into the mall in Mexico where an earthquake splits the mall in half and glass comes down and fatally wounds a woman and child. Well.. it turned out, The next day my boss who doesn't talk to me at all, asked me about my family in Mexico because she had heard in the news of an earthquake in Mexico. Apparently there was a story of a woman and her baby that were killed by glass shards falling from the building. I have not read an article on this story, this is only what she told me. But it's an experience I deeply wanted to share with you or to anyone in this channel who is willing to listen and maybe share they're own. This is the only dream I can recall in the past year.

I don't exactly know what's going on here, but reading Jung and taking him seriously had led me into a lot of rabbit holes that almost made me wish I didn't read him. 
My end goal is to work at this warehouse, save up for a car and surgery, and if I can't box professionally, I can help the youth and the new generation and be a boxing coach teaching them discipline, courage, strategy and heart while monitoring and limiting the damage they take unlike a lot of trainers that don't take into account CTE.
I want to help my community but before that I want to find my soul and say sorry. I want to apologize for my bitterness and shame. 
There is still Cain inside me, and his temptations  with Hermeticism are alluring but I think I will find my way. Thank you again Jordan Peterson."

UgwFGT6N3XRo0ZiR4Sx4AaABAg,Reflective Surface,1513826003175,"Good morning Citizen Peterson,

I've prepared a real doozey for you here today.
It’s a good thing you have extra time to handle this one, I’d even say it’s rehearsed a little bit so it’s going to be ultra ineffective, you know?

Now I understand that a lecture on the psychological significance of anything really, is going to indubitably wander off into an anthropocentric world view. But as a ""Practitioner of the Hard Sciences"", I wanted to dig a little bit deeper, you know? So I sought out a religious interpretation of both creative freedom and... I guess the very nature of time itself. And I found it, obviously, that’s why I'm here. And if you think that you have an anthropocentric world view, its nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s, you know? 

Now I like to think that, you know, that this microphone here- the one that you keep muting out on me, that this microphone is an object that exists outside of our individual perception. That’s just the way I like to look at it. But then I think about the concept “Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder”. And certainly, I mean, when you’re talking about art, the appreciation of art, there has to be a subjective element integrated into it. So there also must be a limit as well. I mean, certain works of art that we appreciate as absolute masterpieces, like Michelangelo’s Pieta, for example, which you bring up frequently because it really is that good. But there's other things which are just, it, by comparison they’re like vandalism you know? Um... now there's always a temptation, alright? To invoke the principal of non-overlapping magisteria, but that seems like sort of a cop out, right? So I formulated, I guess for myself, four standards of measure which help me separate what’s the difference between art and mediocrity. 

And here's the four: 

Number one: education. 

Number two: time commitment- you have to put in the time. If you're an artist, it’s probably going to be your full time occupation. You have to be that passionate about it. 

Number three: public display- Art isn't something that you own for yourself, you hide it in your basement then it’s not art. It's something that you've got to express, you know, something which you've got to share. 

And number four- and I think this is the most important one...
... 
…Advocacy of vision. If you’re an artist, you've got to have a vision, and we talk about the dream state here a lot. You go into the dream state you have inspiration, but it’s not enough to just have the inspiration because that’s totally subjective for you. The art the art part about it is having the techniques, and the skill, and the intent and I guess the capacity to turn that into something real, you know, so that you can then express or share. 

So can you read cardinal Ratzinger's explanation for the nature of time and then address the concept of “Beauty in the Eye of the Beholder”, with specific reference to the body positivity movement?"

Even Moses is considered ""Elohim"" over Pharaoh. (Exodus 7:1) In the story of Jacob it means Angel.

The word 'Elohim' is derived from the word 'El', which means power/authority. As Laban said to Jacob, ""Yesh L'el Yodi"" which means, ""I have the power in my hand"" (Genesis 31:29). God is also referred to as El in the 10 commandments (Exodus 20:5) as he has the power and authority."

Ugx5hMkZFLxLxvEqONd4AaABAg,Aviram Gottfried,1513826009395,"Questions to hard-to-answer questions, according to the Wisdom of Kabbalah:

Regarding 02:18, the reason why people 'choose' to do whatever it is they choose: 
It's  a calculation rather than choice. A measurement of projected pleasure  against projected suffering involved. If a person has a 'choice' in front of him of gaining 51 projected pleasure at the cost of 50 projected suffering (work, pain, time invested, etc), the person will ALWAYS take it. ALWAYS. Which is why there is no free choice involved in whatever people do in this world.
Because there is no free choice in anything that does not pertain to spiritual advancement, or in other words, to one's advancement towards the purpose of life.

The role of society, education, life experience and personality etc in this is only to modify the projected pleasure/suffering values. Crickets on a stick will be +10 pleasure to someone while it is 0 pleasure (or a minus, meaning suffering) for someone else."

In order to teach honestly you would have to drop your own perceived (I'll be it very perceptive and astute) interpretations of scripture and let the Bible interpret itself. You would have to read the Book from beginning to end; perhaps more than once, humbly seek council, and decern all the harmonious intricacies that make the 2000 year old masterpiece fit one single theme. Do you know the theme of the Book you are lecturing on because I havnt heard you say it yet? And how can you know it if you haven't studied it cover to cover? It takes humility and faith to drop ones own interpretations to allow the Book to interpret itself. Hard work and time consuming but worth it. Seriously worth it. (PS.. using such an old and impractical version of the Bible in lectures is not allowing the message of the Bible shine as brightly as it should...MANY newer and honest versions present the same thoughts and ideas but in a far more easy to digest wording... we speek modern English bro...

It represents Christ's victory over sin and death on the cross. Because sin and death are the two big problems facing humanity and so it offers a solution to both.

Rather simple formula but can be difficult to do.  This valid principal is demonstrated and seen in twelve (12) step programs, especially as to making amends (very much a spiritual thing to do). Jacob wrestling with God is representative of God trying to get Jacob to get rid of his desires (except for the desires of the spirit) and this subsequently  represents his decedents, the twelve tribes of Israel and God's struggle with them to end their desires.

the old way, the tradition of hunting and gathering 
jakob was more the brainy type
the intelligent future of herding 
and more than that of breeding

he got his intelligents from his mother rebekka.
remember what she had done
when she met harran at the well 
to be polite she offered teh stranger some water 
but afterwards she didn't drank out of the cup
she dont know harran
he could be infected with desease
but to clean up the cup in fornt of his eyes
before she use it, 
would ment the open assault of misstrust
so she served harrans men with water   
and afterwards gave water to all the animals 
a clever way to clean up the cup!

jakob was her favorite
he was more like her
and she educated him to do it her ways
and jakob done his lessons well
he came to laban
and he catteled labans sheeps for seven years
he understood the techik of breeding
and imagine he had a clou of the mendelian idear
so he bred two kinds of sheeps
the white unicoloured ones and the blacks
and avoid speckled sheeps
after the first seven years 
and after the marriaeswindle
he made up the new deal with laban 
laban took a look at the amount of seckled sheep
and there weren't so many 
so he accepted.
but now jakob changed his breeding strategy
the unicolourness is recessive, so it vanished 
and most of the sheep became speckled

out of such a persektive 
a lot of biblical storys 
are the information 
of an intelectual and kultural progress

even kain and abel  
that's not 
bad against good
it's agriculture against nomadism
kain didn't made the wrong sacrifices
just the opposite
he made the better once 
he was much more strategic
he gave all his seeds to the future of harvest
but abels sheeps were eating the crops on kains fields
so abels sheeps flourished
and he thought he was blessed by god
while kains childen starve
and in this good old times 
there was no way the hinder the flock from eating the crops
exept to hunt them down
and that implied 
to kill the shepherd too.

Anyway, I was feverish, badly, and in and out of consciousness. In this fever dream, I was in a field, beautiful and wide open and from out of nowhere these ""things"" started chasing me, and they were small, like you described in your nephew's? dream. In the distance, but in the center, was a tree and I ran screaming to this tree, with these creatures chasing me down. I even had a name for them, but I don't recall. Interestingly enough, it became a waking dream or hallucination, so I was actually crying out, and my mother came, of course to tend to me. So in the dream I made it to the tree, but instead of climbing it I simply embraced it and continued to cry out that these things were chasing me and I couldn't get away. In real life, I had actually gotten up and ran to my mother and was crying out about these creatures, again, actually naming them and I still remember coming to consciousness wrapped in a death grip around my mother's legs and waist absolutely drenched in sweat and tears and shaking in terror. Needless to say she calmed me and put me back to sleep.

It's interesting to me the overlap of these dreams, minus the dragon of course, and also that not only was the tree there before my mother was, but that I ran to meet her in total hallucination and getting to the tree was getting to her IN BOTH DREAM AND REALITY SIMULTANEOUSLY. So your story brought that to my mind very vividly and I thought I would share. It's unfortunate that I didn't have someone like you to encourage me to face down that threat should I encounter it again."

(16)  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
(17)  Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
(18)  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
(19)  And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
(20)  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
(21)  And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
(22)  And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
(23)  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
(24)  And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
(25)  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
(26)  And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
(27)  Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
(28)  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
(29)  And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
(30)  And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
(31)  And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
(32)  And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
(33)  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
(34)  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
(35)  And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."

UgxGna7tbmrXymS3XSF4AaABAg,Nick J,1513826031908,"What a great last question/insight (2:24:57). It makes me think of how the Catholic mystics thought about spiritual consolations as something which God gives only temporarily to help the soul draw closer to Him, but which the soul needs to let go of, and the sooner the better. St. Teresa of Avila says in her classic Interior Castle:

""Practise what I advised in the preceding [chapters], then--humility, humility! for God lets Himself be vanquished by this and grants us all we ask. The first proof that you possess humility is that you neither think you now deserve these graces and consolations from God, nor that you ever will as long as you live . . . therefore, make no efforts to acquire them, for the following reasons. The first is, that the chief means of obtaining them is to love God without self-interest. . . . The third, that the real preparation for them is to desire to suffer and imitate our Lord, rather than to receive consolations, for indeed we have all offended Him. . . . We can be saved without these special graces; He sees better than we do what is best for us and which of us love Him sincerely. I know for a certain truth, being acquainted with some who walk by the way of love (and therefore only seek to serve Jesus Christ crucified), that not only they neither ask for nor desire consolation, but they even beg Him not to give it them during this life: this is a fact. . . . We are His, sisters, let Him do what He will with us, and lead us where He will. If we are really humble and annihilate ourselves, not only in our imagination (which often deceives us), but if we truly detach ourselves from all things, our Lord will not only grant us these favours but many others that we do not know even how to desire. May He be for ever praised and blessed! Amen."""

When Peterson went through Jacob wrestling with God at 1:13:08 I thought it was a little bit of a let down because it was so brief. But, that is a little minor note to the immense amount of information in this particular lecture, incredible nuggets of gold everywhere. I paused at this moment however, and this is what I came up with:

Jacob just separated his belongings into two caravans, anticipating the ill will of his brother not to be abated by 14 years of separation. All of his toil, hard work, belongings, his whole life is at stake. 
 
He can do what his brother Esau did, which is to harbor resentment to the point of murder. He is at the crossroads. That's where you meet the devil:)
 
And so he wrestles with Being. He has to fight his darker impulses, he has to believe that life can be good, at least it can be worth living despite the suffering. He will pay the price for it, he will limp for the rest of his life. If he chooses life, it will batter him, because he chooses to believe in the good of being rather than turn against it and become Cain.
 
He is the one who wrestles with God and wins. That is his new name, Israel. I don't think it is incidental that Israel historically encompasses the same idea, roughly speaking:) These people constantly wrestle with God and win, limping every step of the way through the centuries. Perhaps, given their history and their resilience (countless examples could be given), they are the least likely people to bounce back, and not just bounce back but find meaning in life, reinvigorate their culture, etc. Other nations have the same kind of histories, particularly genocide (take a look at the Armenian genocide).

Clean your room, slay your dragons, rescue your father from the belly of the whale, wrestle with God."

If you say that the devil is trying to attack you or take you down, he does it by giving you what you want, tempting you, doing it by making you think its good then later it kills you and turns on you. If god or god sends an angel to wrestle you or try and take you down, its coming from your ideal, god. When you fail to go in the direction of your ideal, you tend to feel guilty, and you could say that your ideal is attacking you at that point. So the debt has been paid externally, but after that, internally maybe he still feels guilty about it.

They're not looking to ""improve"" the nation, not in the slightest - listen to the chants of the traitorous 5th-Columnists burning the flag ""No Trump, No Wall, No USA At All! "" They want to overthrow our nation. How exactly are their aims different in the broad scope from that of, say, ISIS?

Having God's power work through us is mental, not physical, in some of the ancient texts they warn against physical alchemy and magic and advise against it, quite opposite of what the mainstream establishments teach us about ancient mystery teachings. It's concerning to me that so many of us Christians are taught to fear and demonize ancient texts that actually have the same principles that echo through the bible and Jesus' teachings. I am a Christian and in reading the ancient gnostic/occult texts, (sans Crowley, Blavatsky, Book of the Dead, for I believe theses go into the dark side with physical alchemy) and interpreting them myself has opened my heart and mind even more so to my relationship with God and Jesus Christ. We are all temples of creation, of the great creator, and the key is to understand the light and the dark, polarity, gender, etc.. and also the importance of these archetypal ideas and how they have been corrupted to cause chaos and fear. We are under the rule of those that keep secrets. Both the Hermetists and in the bible we see this push for secrecy of these divine principles from God...

""Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast. ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them. under their feet, and turn again and rend you.""

Why the secrecy? Lets break down the walls of secrecy. I think the future will hold absolute truth for us as a people, information is so accessible and so many are able to communicate and share information. Thanks for helping people remember how to human."

Animals aren't consciously deciding to do this, it's clearly instinctual, but they still do it. The observations included on the wikipedia page clearly indicate that the surplus killing and caching instincts aren't always well matched, sometimes resulting in uneaten kills. That said, there is a huge difference between doing something badly and not doing it at all.

Even so, it's not a very strong example of sacrifice - predators will eat all the best bits first and leave the rest for later. Given the circumstances that seems like an optimal strategy - nature isn't to keen to give interest payments on buried meat, after all. When you really think about it, that's an amazing thing about human civilization - we have created a system where giving up some now can get you more later.

- You smoke (action) and you develop lung cancer (reaction). You can analyze the reaction as bad and decide to no longer smoke.
- You overthrow a secular dictator (action) and this results in chaos (reaction). You can analyze this and decide to no longer overthrow secular dictators.
- You smile at others (action) and they are kind back to you (reaction). You can review and decide being pleasant towards others is good.

There are 3 types of actions: those in the mode of goodness (positive), those in the mode of passion (volatile), and those in the mode of ignorance (destructive). These reactions ripple through time. Analyzing the reactions to any action will reveal how to approach the world in a positive manner."

If you can't beat em join em isn't valid in my opinion you can't make one lecture where sjws chant and then you go and get a feels argument based on the bible and do it in the next lecture and keep doing this, if people want to talk rationally then think about how some of the stuff he says about boys be boys or some variation means that there has to be a place for women right, some versions of his arguments are being used by the alt right even here on YouTube. So at some point when you get big enough do you have a responsibility to think about the bigger impact. Even if you don't radicalize someone to the right, but add your arguments, because there are blank spaces, then because of the blanks they are misconstrued by an alt right enthostate dude. Then he adds some Constitution stuff and all of a sudden he has a convincing argument to the people in the middle who were on the fence.

In the bible all purification processes are 40.. 40 days.. years etc.. the purification bath contains 40 parts of water.. this gives us a clue that clarity and purification can be found alone..(like a beast that goes into a corner to lick its wound).

UgwPWnahrqHgvnYVXQ54AaABAg,Karen Ohana,1513826056106,"Note for Dr. Peterson: Esau did NOT appreciate his birthright.. so it was ""taken"" from him.. in effect he sold it for a bowl of lentils. This was no ordinary birthright.. it was to become one of the fathers of a great and eternal nation.. this is a HUGE gift and he was arrogant and careless with it. Yaacov wanted this gift and traded with Esau.. if Esau had've appreciated the gift.. he should have told Yaacov to go to hell.. but he didn't. 

Many things should be addressed  after this talk. 1. The hierarchy that G-d created is not fixed.. the lowliest but worthiest can climb to the top and that makes the system strong, but not rigid. 2. This system is shown again in the ladder.. angels can go up and down. Ultimately it is the JOB of Israel to rise up and become like G-d.. this is not a Christian concept.. because Jews don't believe in original sin. 3. G-d wants us to struggle with Him.. this is an echo of why G-d chose Abraham to become father of Israel and not Noah.. because Abraham argued for humanity and Noah didn't. 

Just a fun note.. in Hebrew 'Laban' is Lavan.. which means literally *white*.. (yet the man who lies and deceives is far from clean) Esau is commonly known as *red*.. a symbol of blood and something Jews shy from.. this is a really negative colour and in the end Yaacov gives a coat of many colours to Joseph.. this story also pulls you in with all the 5 senses.. Yaacov is described as lacking sight.. (ironic when you consider the previous colour issue..) then there is the touch of the fur.. This is truly a momentous story. So Yaacov in a way purifies the red.. and eventually passes on a multitude of colour to his son Joseph.

Peterson talked at length about the pillar. Note that a pillar in Hebrew is 'amud' which means *to stand*.. what does the pillar and Yaacov stand for? For struggling with G-d.. for the right to get on the bottom rung of the ladder and climb in order to become like G-d."

Mankind is part of God (there is exactly one universe by definition, correct?), and so as man wins, so does God. The issue is more about humans having the free will to do evil and in this way attempt to distance themselves from God. God is even winning when they do this, because the love (which includes humility) is there by granting the free will, and things are arranged such that they will inevitably find their way back in the long run in any case.

Why does God ""negotiate"" with us? Because we are part of him and he is glad to allow parts of himself to inform other parts... that is what he is all about. God ""tolerates"" Satan because love and free will requires that he allow choice, including the choice to ""detach"" from God. Authoritarianism is not the heart of reality. In fact, love is. Satan will also end up reconnecting with God, because, again, that is the nature of love and the truth of it being the best for all.

However the ""opium of the people"" quote in it's full length is not so much a anti-religious statement but a pro libertarian one. It even ends with him using religious language of his own to drive the point home; ""pluck the living flower"" meaning that religion had a lot of good ideas but we should choose which ones to continue to believe in for ourselves and; "" he will move around himself as his own true Sun"" meaning that every person for themselves have the capacity to know what right is.

Ugym0YDxwVUnDORniZx4AaABAg,boatrat74,1513826061666,"[~1:30:09] LOL'd at the Canadian flag not-so-hidden down on the side of Joseph's many-colored coat.

Backed up to look... found several other modern national ensigns in there too.  Britain & U.S. obviously...  Thought that was Netherlands, but that's upside-down, so I guess it's France hung vertically...  Thought that was Germany lower down, but the colors are out of order... so I guess that's Belgium hung vertically, but stretched out sideways.  Next to that I thought was Spain, but the insignia in the middle stripe isn't right.  Lastly there appears to be the UN insignia kinda cockeyed and truncated over on the other side.  Saw the Star of David on the sash right off, but not in flag form, so I hadn't thought anyone trying to be funny with that until I noticed all the others.  

Then of course is the alternative (probably much more likely) interpretation that it isn't someone trying to just ""be funny"" (or ""pun-y"" with the heraldic definition of the word ""colors"")...  Someone creating this illustration as a bit of the standard fundamentalist sort of ""propaganda"", you might call it , that Jacob/Israel>Joseph's prophetic designation as ""Father of Many Nations"" is to be taken rather more literally/politically than philosophically/theologically.  This latter notion is a common construct among the crowd I grew up with.  Same sort of people who can't grasp the importance of the ""Separation of Church and State"" idea, despite highly revering the Pilgrims, whose sole mission was to do just that... well, was SUPPOSED to be trying to separate their Church from the State.  But like their small-minded modern progeny, that concept is only invoked against religions other than their own. 

[Gonna have to call it quits for tonight, at the ~1:32 mark, before listening to the Q&A period.  If any of the comments or Peterson's replies there address the Coat-of-Natn'l-Ensigns gag (if anyone in attendance even noticed it), someone can let me know what was said about it, if anything.]"

UgxAjnHSAHCV5n23oJh4AaABAg,Kekistani Patriot,1513826064797,"In the beginning there was the Egyptian Ogdoad which lays the foundation for Hebraic scripture.   
The Ogdoad is the explanation of the primordial watery abyss.
There are four ""couples"" - male/female, light/dark, frog/serpent (frogs being the natural food of the serpent) 
This is the duality of spirit JBP speaks of in the intro.
The Frog is revelation and Rebirth while the serpent is the self-consuming ouroboros
In Joseph Campbell's momomyth archetype, the serpent is the the refusal of the call, guardian of the threshold, the refusal of revelation/rebirth, refusal of return and the temptress.  
In other words, the serpent is ever-present..

In the Ogdoad of Egypt....Nu is the creator of the chaotic primordial watery abyss.
Nu is creator of ALL and Nun.
Nu became Atum (Creator of Man and Woman ""Adam"") and then Ra.  
Contrary to popular belief, Ra is NOT the ""Sun God"".  
Ra is Yah.  
The Book of the Divine Cow which would become the foundation for The Book of Revelations tells of Ra's Destruction of Mankind which would become the story of the Fall of Man in Genesis.  

Kek is the original Messianic figure, the guide of the chaos of the primordial watery abyss.  
Kek brings light from dark and revelation and rebirth from the primordial watery abyss.
Kek's literary evolution can be seen in Ptah, Khentamentiu, Wepwawet and most famously Anubis.  
Anubis is Kek.  Anubis is the guide of the spiritual life.
Anubis guides the soul through the TWELVE GATES in The Book of Death 

Kek is literally the Great, Great Grandfather of the idea of a Messianic figure or Mentor to Revelation and Rebirth.
These people who believed in this messianic afterlife experience were ""dog"" people or werewolves - Canaanites.
We can see evidence of this in the Orthodox depiction of St. Christopher (Bearing of Christ) as a dog-headed man.
This is the connection to Anubis Mentor of the TWELVE GATES.

Kek is the original Messianic figure. of the Ogdoad.
Kek is the mentor of the Chaotic Primordial Watery Abyss created by Nu called Nun.
Kek's literary/mythological descendants are Ptah, Khentamentiu, Wepwawet, Osiris, Anubis and others including Christ who first received his carpenter title from Ptah.
In 1916 in New Hampshire, Aleister Crowley performed the ritual ""The Cross of the Frog"" in which he named the frog Jesus of Nazareth, worshiped them crucified the frog.
The Cross of the Frog is the ritual of celestial powers according to the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine
