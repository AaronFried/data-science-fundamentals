Jordan, are you saying that when a woman rejects a man she is mother nature in disguise?
Are you saying that women know what is best for the world, perhaps, and is instantiated in the way they reject less-than-men and bond with real men? always??, sometimes??
Are you assuming that women do not go corrupted and they do not speculate and lie and play sadistic games with men's sexual attention? 
What is your actual experience with women in the real world, apart from books and psychotherapy room??
Man, you almost show your teeth when talking like that about men...YOU ARE VERY HARSH WITH MEN...you seem to have no condition to put the load on men and render women the infants that are exempt from achieving ""moral sophistication"" as you would put it, so it seems to me that according to your narrative, it is enough for women if they just have a body to procreate...?? and men have to take responsibility for the irresponsible women...maybe??
You seem to be a super achiever, BUT NOT EVERY MAN IS LIKE YOU.

The theological/philosophical answer is: nature of humanity changes fundamentally to children estranged from their father, through the disobedience acted out in eating the fruit. In the person of Christ man is redeemed back to the Father absolutely, but it requires that he act obediently through eating the flesh of the Son. In that singular act of obedience, man is restored back to his original relationship with the Father, and he awaits the restoration of his body which comes in the resurrection."

UgxtMnpGgoF5wk4NyqN4AaABAg,J,1532142093579,"I always have this suspicion that Jordan Peterson assumes that women already are the way they should always be, and they have nothing to work on, so when a woman rejects a man is always the man the one that should man up.
For Jordan, so it's seems to me, women are always right, and that confuses me.
What about women then?...
Jordan says..""when a woman rejects a man, she is telling him...I APPRECIATE YOU AS A FRIEND, BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOUR GENETIC MATERIAL SHOULD PROPAGATE ITSELF INTO THE FUTURE... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ2BtdTCrU ...I would accept this from a woman who has attained a level of maturity and moral sophistication like no one.

But what woman is like that today? many women are still bound to animalistic behaviour and attracted to pimps for secret wild sex adventures...and maturity is boring for them...and men see that there is more erotic success when they try to become what women demand...and many men follow...and those men leave their own paths...

On the other hand, men feel they can not impose a quality control on women AS EASY AS women do on men, because men are teased into wanting sex by women everywhere...thus, women play to increase men's sexual desire to gather more suitors, and so men find more difficult to be PATIENT, which is the key to be able to ""man up and be eligible to pass his genetic material"", because is the only way to scan the woman that he is attracted to and find answers to this questions:
Is she morally sophisticated?, 
Will she be a good and strong woman?, 
Can she admit her wrongs and state them?, 
Can she be resilient and dependable?
Is she ready to investigate the truth and find it and tell it? 
Can she be proactive, and find solutions to problems?

So we see two forces pushing in opposite directions...
It seems to me that Jordan poses all the responsibility of the world ON MEN, and women just have to be. It is enough if women just become mothers and men have to become all things for a woman to be let to pass his genetic material into the future... nothing more is said."

I mean because then it's just his interpretation.  Which isn't less valid (or at least rationally I can conclude that) but I FEEL like authorial intent matters and it grounds these ideas through time and gives them significance. Otherwise they weren't as significant before these points of analysis were made. Because if the authors didn't intend for them how are they significant throughout history and until this point. If the authors meant for these things to be in the bible or to be interpreted this way, how come most of it has (for the most part) been interpreted differently and almost completely literally?

WHO IS RIGHTEOUS AND WALKS IN ALL THE WAYS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS? (or something to that effect) "" He was saying: Satan - have you tested him ? And seen that he would walk in all ways of righteousness? (see, God already knew Job would succeed - and Job would not blaspheme God - and even if Job failed, God would be there and God loved Job - he would provide for all his needs as Job was righteous and good in character). Now The devil probably didn't know that but like every THOR movie (strange this was actually the analogy I had in my head when I realised what the book of Job meant - or at least what that one section so frequently misunderstood by many even Christians - meant) - Lokie would sometimes come up brandishing his sword or sceptre or whatever he is holding and challenge thor or mock him - ""You think you so great spits ... with scorn, with contempt - and with rebellion and ultimate disrespect* That's the kind of picture God put in my mind to think of when I read about Satan coming up to the Lord - Satan is the adversary of God - he wants to take control - to test people - to ultimately show people that God is not there and to show them that God doesn't care - or that God that he's not as great as he is - which God is (great, I mean)  - and of course God in all his wisdom would know that (he is great) and know that Job would serve him and not curse Him or turn away - but Why then put Job through all that testing? Ultimately - God rewarded Job - but not only that - it was out of LOVE and pride for his creation that he tested Job - and afterwards - he RESTORED to JOB precisely DOUBLE of all that was taken away from him from the Hand of Satan - but God providentially allowed this - not only restoring him but testing him and showing to the world - the manifold wisdom of God - that God is worthy to be praised. If you're interested - which I think you might be - go check out the book of Job - you can totally explore this idea. (Plus the point I want to make is that Imagine Satan basically seething with rage at the fact that even through all the testing - Job did not sin ONCE with his lips - it says in the bible (He wouldn't curse God or heed his wife's advice to ""curse God and die"") - when Satan's goal is precisely to undermine God's sovereignty and authority as creator and ruler of the world - see Satan wants to be ruler of the world - so what better way to gain control than by showing that the one ruler is not the right ruler? - i.e. that his creation would curse his name? - that was Satan's plan in everything - my theory at least - the theory to put creation - God's creation - in rebellion - direct perversion to God's actual proper rulership and to have them ""sin"" - which is falling under the standard God creates. But God sent his son to die once for the sins of all men - so that whoever believeth in him shall not perish (their spiritual part, I mean) but have eternal LIFE. I'm sure you know this but just to finish this off - Godspeed. :)"

10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through Elohim to the pulling down of strong holds;)

6:8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of YHWH, whether he be bond or free.

6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.

6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in YHWH, and in the power of his might.

6:11 Put on the whole armour of Elohim, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of Elohim, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

That you would naturally want to try the fruit, out of curiosity. Like it’s human nature. We think that way because we are evil. We are naturally rebellious. Adam would have had no desire to eat of the forbidden fruit because he trusted God and believed his word. It was sufficient reason for him. It wasn’t until he was tempted, by Eve, that he considered and desired to eat of it like Eve did. Eve was tempted by the talking serpent who told her lies. Consciously she was no match for the serpent. She was flattered to be considered worth talking to by such an intelligent creature. When God visited the garden he would call for Adam. He would talk to him and Adam would then give instructions to Eve. She was not there when God told Adam about the restriction on their diet so she was telling the serpent what Adam had told her. She added the part about not touching it. This was not in the original instructions given to Adam. 

Eve shouldn’t have answered the serpent because she knew that the serpent was a lower form of life which was incapable of understanding human language nor did it have the physical ability to be able to form words much less put together complex thoughts In human language. Eve didn’t know who was speaking to her. If it wasn’t the serpent who was it? The fact that she did answer the serpent meant that she believed in the talking serpent, something which in fact didn’t exist. She thus came under its power. She had lost the ability to think rationally. 

Today Adam would have had her visit a shrink. She was hearing voices and talking to someone who wasn’t there. She would likely be put on drugs and kept under observation so that she wouldn’t hurt herself or others.  We can’t take the Creation story literally because we have no faith in God’s word. We think it is impossible for God to have created everything in just six days. We are sick and dying because of sin, the sin of unbelief. We don’t want God, the Crestor in the social equation because he brings inequality and accountability. But we all need miracles if we are going to continue living  here on planet earth. We need miracles otherwise we are the dead burying the dead like Jesus said."

The ""real"" Adam and Eve probably had only a very dim consciousness,  just enough to make them start making experiments with other solutions to a problem than the one offered to them by their genetically inherited instincts.

I am unshakeable in my beleif and I have absolutely no idea about how this has come about other than I cried out in distress 10 years ago and my life has been transformed beyond my understanding. Where is the proof that we spent 10,s of millions of years living in trees as Dr Peterson says ? Darwin,  was an occultist, proposed some theories that have led us nowhere. What inventions have resulted from what was just a  Victorian England Darwin carnival side show? I can tell you what the fruit was from Sir Alexander Flemming who was born in the last year of Darwins life, he was a Christian who believed the literal translation of the bible and literal biblical creation account of Genesis. His discovery of penicillin has saved hundreds of millions of lives and he will receive a reward in eternity for his work. Darwin has led millions away from God and he will be judged and punished for this. it is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God. God hates and warns us to keep away from the occult and Darwin disobeyed. No one should expect to be rewarded for disobedience as God has said, rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. We live in a time where witchcraft and the occult is rife with the young being indoctrinated by garbage like Rowlings books.

Dr Peterson also said that the reason the snake went for eve first is because she had children. At the time of her temptation she did not have children as far as we can learn from the bible so Dr Peterson is making that up. it was only after the fall that God said she was going to have to give birth in travail and pain to offspring. If Dr Peterson is in error in this and taking artistic licence on this point it makes me wonder what else he is in error about. Yes he is obviously an intelligent man but he is just a man and prone to being wrong like all of us."
Ugz5FEZ2aCkrZSHSszt4AaABAg,TimD Tas,1526871703714,"So I feel that this interpretation of Adam and Eve story could be analogous to the sub conscious process of the dawning of self consciousness from hominid hunter gatherer to homo sapien farmhand and a representation of the fall from the grace of the bosom of nature’s nurturing to the dawning of the idea of the separation of human from nature. A dawn of the concept of survival as a “suffering”. The knowledge of the good and evil coming from the meta cognitive reflections of the “Lord”, which is actually the rational minds reflective process on the consequence of existence. Being ousted from the garden of eden is the reality of this process of conceptualisation, reflecting on existence rather than “being” and responding to the world, it becomes named and this naming leads to self reflection upon existence. Could the whole story be a romantic reflection on the days when we hung out in the trees and the lord’s punishments are the bitter rationalist reflections to this loss of the times when we simply just “were”.

I understand that working on your own dragons is a key to addressing it. But what about our young men deployed in the middle east tasked with eradicating the evil ""out there""? Is there a divine order in the midst of that chaos? Or is this one of those instances that Dr. Peterson refers to where there is no good choice, only the least harmful one?

UgyctNN1HDPxnsaHP7l4AaABAg,Moller Toma,1524279707169,"The story of Adam and Eve is related to the story of Job wherein Lucifer - Serpent plays an essential part. For in the book of Job, Lucifer - who is generally condemned by the uneducated as ""pure evil"" - is clearly shown to be a servant of God, working on His behalf in the temptation and development of Job. 

Somehow you can state that the archetype lucifer is the psychological element that helps the human psyche to grow to understand the morality of Good and Evil. For instance, Imagine you have suddenly the power of creation. Imagine if your spoken words become instant reality, but you don't have any moral maturity, the outcome will hell on earth. Not because most people want to create hell on earth, but if you don't understand the fundamental nature and fabric of existence you probably do more harm than good in the world. 

If we read the story of Adam and Eve we see that Eve was tempted (temptations) by the serpent (Lucifer, which can be also the Angel Samael, that is the same archetype as in the story of Job) to eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil. What is remarkable and important to understand is that she was tempted to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. See, here is the interesting part because eating of the tree of good and evil situates that there is a plane of consciousness that we weren't conscious of and by eating of the tree our eyes were opened. See, the ironic thing is that all the mistakes we make in life are mostly because we can't restraint our psychological, emotional and physical sensations. We are always seeking for the next temptation (temped) to indulge in pleasure and ironically most of the times we regret that we gave in to something that we shouldn't do in the first place. Why I want to state this is because it shows the archetypical role of Lucifer - the tempter of good and evil. See, without difficulties and hurdles in life, we won't develop intellectually, emotionally and physically. Life consists of difficulties and temptations for the sole purpose to overcome them and learn from them. 

Honestly, I think we as humans degenerated because we are constantly indulging in pleasure-seeking temptations and that can be intellectual, emotional or physical, so we are constantly consuming of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If we are sincere and truthfully most of us don't want to hear the truth because the truth isn't something pleasant and wish-fulfilling. The truth can be very harsh on people and it demands a psychological change of who you are by annihilating certain patterns, which can be thought, emotions or other voluntary actions.  People don't want to give up their pleasures (their temptations) and therefore they are ashamed and when God calls them they hide. It is, in my opinion, the sad truth that I see in the world nowadays, just look around, we are being tempted to indulge in pleasures all the time, from food to pornography, the whole spectrum. So Lucifer is presenting you all the time the worldly pleasures and what do we do? We indulge in them because we are not cognizant of the significant role that archetypes play in our human psyche. Most people aren't even cognizant of that fact of manner and will regard this as nonsense and for them ignorance is bliss. But for those who are genuine about the path of understanding, I recommend that you learn more about the ancient religions and their purpose. Every great civilization has its scriptures and by genuine research, you will come to understanding what it means to become human, because were are still animals from a Darwinian perspective, but we have the capacity to become God-like and participate as cosmo creators. Metaphorically speaking we are Sagittarius, half animal, and half human. Here we have a choice, either proceed in our animal nature (sleeping beauty) or transcend into human nature (fully developed conscious being). 

We can create heaven on earth by fundamentally understanding the universal truth of responsibility. If you take your responsibility you aim to become a representation of the Light.  

The day you overcome Lucifer is the day that you will access the tree of life which that is presented throughout all history, the fall of mankind is the realization of individuality wherein we have the free choice to choose Unity and become Christified as the representatives of the light.

Genesis 2:7 - God forms Man. 
Genesis 2:15 - God puts man in Eden. 
Genesis 2:17 God commands man not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 
Genesis 2:18 God says man should not be alone 
Genesis 2:19 & 20 Adam goes on naming spree 
Genesis 2:21-24 Eve is created, named, and doted on. 

Ok, so Eve - according to the timeline layed out - wasn't even around when God warned about not eating from the tree. So when we come to Genesis 3, Eve says ""we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die"" she ADDS the ""neither shall ye touch it"" - that wasn't part of the command as in Genesis 2:17. So is this a game of telephone with Adam relaying what ""God hath said""? I'm quite curious if you had any thoughts on this aspect of Eve not being formed at the time of the command given and the expanding of the original command in Genesis 3:3?"

UgznZD9eJ7OLtwKjGOR4AaABAg,Christopher McClanahan,1521601314004,"Hi Dr. Peterson,

I really enjoy your lectures and consistent, well thought out, points of view on the world. I only discovered you late last year and I have been grinding away are your podcasts ever since. I am half way through this one and noticed the point where you speak about Adam as a hermaphroditic being which was separated into male and female when Eve wad made.

I have been a Christian all my life and for that entire time, I have never heard any preacher or spiritual leader pull meaning out of the Bible like you have. I have found new ways of examining my faith through your teachings especially with the rational approach you are taking.

I could spend all day talking about my revelations since listening to you and some of the areas where I find some disagreement, but given that you are an extremely busy individual, I want to make sure that I focus on an area that I feel is deeply important.

When you speak about Adam as hermaphroditic, and it being directly on the heels of somewhat of a role reversal between God and Lucifer (Satan or whatever you will call him) due to the idea that Lucifer was the being that gave us the fruit of knowledge and therefor consciousness, I find some potential problems.

I am no scholar, but I have always heard of Satan as androgynous, and an attempt to corrupt God's creation would be to make it androgynous or to be more of his image. This same path, as you pointed out in your lecture further on, would lead to more of the breakdown of family. If you are neither, or both, male and female, then the need for truth begins to dissipate as you are not tied to someone through traditional marriage as one flesh. (In essence you are your own whole, which as social creatures we know is not the case.)

I appreciate the angle you are coming from, but I think it is a convenient trap to consider that the original creation of man as hermaphroditic as something that would represent a good state of being. I will grant you that I am coming at this from a faith based perspective, but I am bringing it to your attention so that you might investigate it further from an rational and reductionist standpoint and challenge the idea.

Look at where our society is today with the break down of the family and the gender confusion. I also support the rights of people to do what they want, but it seems to me that this thought is not consistent with the proper state of being that you discuss in the rest of your lectures. Instead, I feel that it makes more sense that Adam was always male, and that female was created to be his companion and that this was always the intended, proper state of being.

When God says do not partake from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, I don't necessarily think it is even a pure metaphor of consumption of knowledge that God put on the earth or that it was necessarily what gave us consciousness. We were conscious enough to communicate and understand that we weren't supposed to eat it when he told us. I think he is basically telling us 'This bad guy fell from heaven to earth in rebellion of me, and you shouldn't buy what he is selling'. When Lucifer fell from Heaven, he did so to corrupt man and create beings in his image. I think it is at least plausible that the story points more towards him teaching us things that God did not want us to know /yet/ and our shame comes from our indulgence in that.

There is a lot that goes into that from the study of the nephilim and fallen angels, but I would certainly enjoy your point of view and wonder if you feel that it would be worth exploring further the hermaphroditic concept as a diversion from truth.

I also realize you did not necessarily take the concept as being the intended point, but I feel there is potentially enough evidence to reduce it out of the potential equation altogether."

I think you get it too far. We got two separate halves because in our ancient ancestors they were responsible for managing right and the left half of bilateral bodies. Nothing more to it. The best proof is the very corpus callosum you mentioned -- connecting the spheres. Both hemispheres are ""separate"" only in macroscopic view, whereas the most sophisticated functions of the brain like image recognition, long-term memory and such are dependent on both hemispheres working together. For example, maybe two hemispheres can develop two personalities, however, they cannot tie their shoes or redraw the full image. Maybe personality is something simpler that those tasks as it would need collateral coordination, but hey...

.. “look at me women! 
I'm different then all men, I'm above them. 
My sperm is so much better. 
I will degrade my sex, sell out to the Witches and cunts among you, the vile women-supremacist mother's lies, those that are morally criminal in throwing away men, husbands, taking children so in the darkness can raise them to Satan's calling, stealing a man's children and twisting them against the father, manhood, fatherhood, Order, God, Love, and Truth!
See my willingness to help Satan destroy society, children, men,...!"" 
.
– by God taking someone child should be a killing offense! And if God didn't command against it I could kill from day-break to sundown with a Smile and a sense I was removing Evil, removing slimy Poison Snakes that Kill Souls, Cause Damnation, and Hell..  
.. if someone kidnapped your children to twist and lie to them in Darkness, to abuse them by instilling self-hate and hiding life and soul Saving known information .. you and your retarded anti-man, anti-fatherhood Satan-conditioned into being an inhuman feelingless cunt-mother defending man-hater.
.
.
At time 2:00:00 Peterson is discussing how horrible Adam was in the story and expands it to the on-line reprehensible men – such as me I assume – but any man who has realize the vileness of women, and the States support of them .. (Go listen to it - a few minutes)
.
 Eve has eaten from the Apple and then Understands Good & Evil, and many other things, then being awaken she manipulates – perhaps with lies and censored and ½ truths Adam into eating it also .. not unsimilar to a Single mother's ability to twist and manipulate self-hate and the Gender Lie into their innocent children to make their lives and all our lives a living horror hell, a life of death-of-joy, a constant victim to those Satanic Praying cunts and Witches all around us, a mixing-up of; trust, vileness, lies, hate, mother-love, evil, horror, victimness, life-confusion, twisted reality, future suicide/murder, tenderness, ..
.
Because Adam is innocent until She gets him to eat. How much can he defend himself from her?
(About as much as a falsely accused rape charged man - which results in his firing from his job, loss of marriage and kids and property, unable to hire a lawyer, surrounded by police, lawyers, judges 'trained' to believe' rape accusers .. and unable to fight because his mother and society filled him with deep self-hate and an unwillingness to see women are oppressors, or to fight against them, and ..?)
.
.
I'll imagine, Dr. Peterson that at the time you gave this talk that you had not yet had the opportunity to read my points about the life-destroying vile creatures of Evil, and Satan's Puppets that walk among us, destroying all Goodness, lying, taking children, destroying fathers and men, twisting children, teachers, gov employees, corporate owners, .., co-workers that one could consider Poison Snakes that destroy lives of men for the pleasure of watching them suffer and suicide ..
..
.. let me say I hope that you have changed from that vile stupid gynocentric empowering and supporting ugly human who is to Blind and Ignorant to realize that you are part of the problem that makes this existence a hell on earth, that you are no longer demonizing some of the only people strong enough or courageous enough to try to make this horrible vile death-maggot run nightmare better for our children, and yours.
.
Get a grip on yourself. 
Your insistence on this degrading of women/State victimized men is damaging to all we hold Good.
.
I really don't want to have the opinion of you that the world would have been better if you and you mother were never born, but if you insist by helping kick more men who's lives have been destroyed, children taken along with property, or otherwise been victimized and speaking out against it to you Blind, Deaf, cunt-mother conditioned human tool of Satan, and if another man suicides - driven by your contempt towards him when he was struggling through your lectures to understand how such things happen to him, or abused by those who were exposed to your vileness, he confused because he never wanted anyone hurt, oppressed, and he tried to actively supported women when he 'believed' them, those he loved and trusted, and society, and loved and trusted a few and now is homeless, destroyed, children and wife taken away with home and all he ever worked for and loved, children twisted against him, .. if that men dies because of you – then I'll have to say ..
.. “your life is less then positive and I'm sorry you lived. The world would have been better had you not have.”
.
Do you Understand? 
Can you open your mind to what those “sniveling bitter” men are trying to say, or was your life just another Satanic Tool to promote those forces that will bring extra horror, death, killing, Suffering, Pain, into the lives of your children, and us all.

UgxtEZQWLeNJ90Rrp_V4AaABAg,Joel Villegas,1513825328838,"Hello. Hi. Interesting presentation. To say the least.
I find the present interpretation of Adam problematic. It does not coincide with the biblical pattern of salvation: Sin-repentance-salvation.
Their problem (sin) is manifested in their nakedness. The solution without God is to make aprons, which they don't cover properly, i. e. they leave the butt exposed (as a false religion does). 
Then God comes to challenge them. Adam's first response is inaccurate: the fear he felt was because he had sinned against the divine command, and had been discovered, the nudity he accused is a side effect. 
God gives him another chance and asks him directly about sin. This time Adam speaks with repentance (which is to declare before God, the supreme moral judge, things exactly as they happened and to wait for his mercy). The sin was ""to eat"" and he says, ""I did eat"". The woman does the same as well.
Then God accepts repentance and shows His grace; thus He provides them with appropriate, more sophisticated coverings: coats (true religion covers you well) through the sacrifice of one or more innocent animals (the salvation of sinners costs Christ to die for them). 
At the same time, it allows them to glimpse the general plan of salvation, in which they can place the hope of recovering the lost life, that is, of resurrecting to eternal life (the restoration of perfect communion with God).
This interpretation, I believe, makes more sense than that of an Adam trying to shun his guilt, because God never treated the proud with mercy (in reality, he always leaves them free to go astray, that is, he would have left them with the aprons of fig leaves); and this first exchange will be the one that marks the entire relationship between God and fallen humanity.
I hope that not much is lost in translation, and that the observation will be useful to you. 
Cheers."

It is God through His only begotten son as we believe in Him, who laid down his life (the lamb slain from the foundation of the earth) and took it up again having conquered death and the grave and returns us to our rightful place as stewards of the new earth. understanding that the first three chapters of Genesis are the creation of the earth and the last three chapters of Revelation (Satan and his false prophet and false holy spirit having finally been cast into the lake of fire) are the creation of the new earth which those who take hold of the covenant, being sealed, shall occupy as stewards."

And like them them tries to be some 15 minutes in advance of the truth. But Jordan is actually starting to find out that he is 2,000 years behind it! He strains his voice with a painfully naivety in exaggeration while uttering his truths. And he is being punished in the fittest and funniest way, for Jordan Peterson has kept his truths, but he is slowly discovering, not that they were.. not truths, but simply that they were not Jordan Peterson's truths. While he fancied that he stood alone... he is really in the ridiculous position of being backed up by all of Catholicism. It may be, Heaven forgive him, that Jordan Peterson did try to be original; but he has only succeeded in inventing all by himself an inferior copy of the existing traditions of the Catholic religion. Jordan Peterson did try to found a New scientific/psychological heresy of his own; but as he puts the last touches to it, we all see that all Jordan Peterson is discovering is Catholicism! Several times during the Q & A portion's, the sharper, wiser folks in the audience have handed him unsigned papers which he actually reads out loud, which covered basically what he had just been going on about for 2 to 3 hours, and when asked if he knew the author he just read, and who he had to admit he eagerly did agree with, though admitting to his credit that he did not know who had penned it, and when was then informed that he has just read a recent encyclical from the Bishop of Rome... The Pope! He would then blush and shrug, not comment and go to the next question thinking with a concerned look... Jordan Peterson simply needs to perform the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. And he could rest at last, as all this information has been gone over and over by The Jesuit Order... He is Smart so he will get there, and it's interesting to see him go down the same logical path that Jesuits and Carmelites like John of The Cross, went through over 600 to 900 years ago....

Both believe in the Immaculate Conception, though I highly doubt you or your watchers even know what that means.. It has Zero to do with How Jesus was conceived!!!! And it has nothing to do ""with not ""Knowing"" man, That's called The Virgin Birth! And yes Islam Believes that as well! So That's half the Planet right there!

UgzlqFOT4U_eW-oNsmJ4AaABAg,djnikx1,1511233337153,"GENESIS::HOW IT ALL BEGAN!
In Genesis 1 we encounter Adam and Eve. What if I was to suggest that Adam is Atom, the center of all Life. Are you still with me? Well, let us consider all things as we move through this lush Garden of metaphysical Delight. Eden is the primeval dwelling place. The word Eden means De-Light. Since you have continued to read this work even after l suggested that Adam is really Atom, let me also suggest to you that Eden is actually the Right hemisphere of the brain. Your very own private and personal garden of De-light. Genesis 2:8, ''And the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden.'' There is the evidence that the garden of Eden is the Right hemisphere of the brain. The garden was planted Eastward. When you are looking to the North, East is always on the Right side. If you read Ezekiel 43:2, the scripture says that the glory of the Lord, came from the East. Thus the glory of God comes from the Right side. That is why Jesus in John21:6 says cast your net to the Right side and you will find. So if East is at the Right side, then we can consider the idea that things of Delight and Love come from the Right side. 
Remember in Numbers 2:3 the tribe of Judah was positioned at the East at the point of the rising Sun. Judah being the origin of the word Jew, Gods' chosen people. THUS GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE ARE THOSE WHO POSITION THEMSELVES TO THE RIGHT SIDE!!!!! They were the Children of Light. Isn't it interesting that in Numbers 2:9 the number of people who were in the tribe of Judah is counted at l86,400 which is the constant speed of Light? 
The description of Adam/Atom is consistent with all energy, both male and female. It is not referenced to a single person. This is true of God as well. In Genesis 1:27, God is called Elohim which is both male and female. In Genesis 3:22, the scripture is quoted as having God say, ‘’man has become as one of us’’.
We know that Genesis has God making Man in Our image. So the plural of both male-female, as energy, is clearly stated. In Genesis 5:1, The scripture says, ""this is the generations of Adam in the day God created man. (Man here refers to mankind which includes female as well). The scripture goes on, ""in the likeness of God made he him. Let us pause here for this is very important.
The scripture has just told us that mankind was made in the likeness of God. The very next  verse will tell us exactly what God is like. Let us see. Genesis 5:2, ""male and female created he them and blessed them and called THEIR name Adam."" So we prove by the very words of the Bible that God is both male and female, and all is One and called Adam/Atom. What happened to Eve, what about the Garden, where's Cain and Abel ? All these things disappear as we look at the second creation which is Cosmic Consciousness. Let us continue to consider Adam/Atom and see if we can somehow prove scientifically our suggestion that Adam and Atom, are the same. Nuclear Fission occurs when an electron is removed from an Atom. This causes energy to multiply. The Biblical allegory describes nuclear fission thusly. Genesis 2:21, God formed a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and took one of his ribs and the rib that God took he used to make a woman. Thus the energy is multiplied by the splitting of the Adam/Atom. The Biblical Allegory describes this fact of science thusly. In Genesis 2:21 it says that God formed a deep sleep to fall on Adam and took one of his ribs. In Genesis 2:22 it says that the rib God took, he used to make a woman. Thus the energy is multiplied by the splitting of the Adam/Atom. So here we see the evolution of life from the physical Adam to the mental Eve.

Next we are introduced to the Serpent.
Genesis 3:1 says that the serpent was more subtile then any beast of the field. The word subtile is subtle and means clever. It is a portrait of the human spine represented as a serpent and pictured as the source of sensual temptation. Of course this makes total sense since all of our sensual temptation comes through the physical body. We have already concluded that Eve represents the mind in our creation allegory. Eve the mind is tempted by the flesh or the lower part. (Represented by the serpent/the spine).
Genesis 2:17 says you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now as you ponder this consider just what could be meant by ''the knowledge of the tree of good and evil.'' These are opposites and they represent confusion. What is being said here is that you should not make your decisions on information that comes through the Carnal mind which is ''good and evil'', but on the other hand you should make your decisions on information which is the result of your Meditation from the Right side.
In this story when Eve eats the fruit, the story is describing how we decide. Eve eats the fruit. The mind considers the matter and makes a decision. Then Adam eats. What originally had begun as a thought (Eve) now manifests into a physical act. When the act is carried out, the Bible says that they immediately realized that they were 'naked'. What is portrayed here is quite simply a 'guilty conscience'. We are exposed to ourselves. To be aware that we are naked is to be aware that we are now exposed to greater problems because of the actions we have chosen to take. In Genesis 3:11 God asks Adam and Eve  who told them they were naked. The answer in Genesis 3:13 is that the serpent beguiled me. In other words we were deceived. Deceived by who?
The serpent..the spine, ourselves. There is a very interesting fact that you should consider right here. Notice the word beguiled in Genesis 3:13. It means to deceive. What is amazing here is that in 2 Corinthians 12:16 the Apostle Paul uses the very same strategy . To secure new converts. Paul says quite frankly I caught you with ‘’guile’’. What is so interesting about this is the fact that in considering the Serpent in our story we must realise that the actions of the Serpent caused Adam and Eve to evolve to a ‘’God like state’’. The ""fall"" was actually a rise in consciousness. The Bible quotes God as saying: ''Man has become as one of us.''

So Paul using guile, and the serpent using guile, gives us pause to consider the identity of both. Both are doing Gods work. It was extremely important for Adam and Eve, (body and mind), to experience good and evil. Evolution to a higher state is impossible without that experience. As God says in Isaiah ''I create good and I make evil, I the Lord do all these things.'' So the serpent is a very important part of God and actually IS God. God and the tempting Serpent are one and the same. Once the decision is made to take from ''the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,'' we are no longer in the Garden of Eden (which the Bible says is positioned in the East), but firmly entrenched in the West (hemisphere of the brain), in the Carnal Mind, the left side, the place of Good and Evil.

For me it's the reason you have the farther, son, and holly spirit. the trinity that creates all matter from firstly unity then duality.

You can find his annual course on Chabad.com under Chumash with Rashi. Hope you will find it both interesting, provoking new ideas and entertaining. ...As for the subject of accusation of Judo-Christian tradition in ravaging nature, I guess the left just does not see any other way of ruling anything or anybody but by total and systematic destruction. This is how the first reference in Torah is translated by Chabad : ""28And God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth. "" and this is how it is detailed the second time: ""15Now the Lord God took the man, and He placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to guard it.""

That marriage keeps you from leaving each other in this day and age, is not true, so, as with a lot of things these days, it is up to you to make it work. Untill the 20 century, it was frowned upon or illegal not to get married, mostly because you had to keep track of who fathered the children, but today, living together is something you choose to do.

Further, he starts by saying that abortion is wrong, then proceeds to give relativist justifications for why a person's only option might be abortion.

In first Timothy 2:14 the Bible states that Adam was not the one deceived.  Just as well Ephesians 5:25 tells husbands to love your wives just as Christ loved the Church and we see that Christ gave his life for the church. When Adam Confesses to God he says ""the women you gave me gave me the fruit and I did eat of it"" adding the ""did"" in the confession makes me feel that he was owning what he had done.  All of this leads me to believe that Adam knew full well what he was doing and chose to eat the fruit and essentially give up Paradise and presumably eternal life for Eve and join her on the cursed Earth.  Essentially making mankind's first sin cursing others for what they hold dear.

I'd love to get your take on this perspective and tear it apart if it is not a good theory."

It'd be easier to spot predators (especially if our main predators are eagles, big cats and snakes) , we're 'safe' with our back to the ocean and we'd only need to venture inland for fresh water and to run down game.

It's also interesting to consider this when you look at modern centres of power (New York, London, Singapore etc), in that they are all on or near the coast. Obviously a big part of that is because of a maritime past,  but you have to wonder if some ancestral evolutionary instinct didn't play a part.

UgyGF1pvTSztJsRmt4R4AaABAg,Help Me Find My Keys,1505962948145,"2:00:10 In regards to this passage

Speaking from a Christian standpoint, it goes even farther than that. Adam - not Eve - was the representative head of humanity. Y'know, feminists like to talk about how the Biblical teachings oppress women with their gender roles but think about that for a second - Adam was the head. He was not only the leader but the burden of responsibility fell solely on his shoulders as well. It was his duty to defend his wife from the Serpent and instead of fending it off he cowardly gave in as well as Eve. They didn't even realize the shame of their nakedness until after Adam himself took of the fruit. The moment not just a human rebelled against God, but humanity itself.

Even beyond that, the idea that God commanded them not to eat of it, not just one of them, or even explicitly Adam in particular, follows a truth that runs throughout the Bible and human history - that if we were there, we would have eaten the fruit as well. We would be the Nazi guards in Germany, if you will. The acknowledgment that we are no better and that we all bear the responsibility of humanity. Eve took of the fruit, and when she offered her husband the same it meant that not only humanity as a species was about to fall, but every living human at the time. It's a picture of our equal ineptitude. It's a theologically and philosophically rich passage, whether you take the Scriptures literally or not, the symbolism and types presented in it are deeply meaningful"

Everything that is wrong may not be illegal, nor should everything that is wrong be made illegal, but what are the most important issues of law and policy? Certainly matters of life and death. And then certainly the sanctity of families and marriage, since that constitutes the building blocks of a society.

Human life is either sacred or it isn't — and if it is sacred, then it's sacred everywhere ; it's sacred in the ghetto, and on the battlefield, and in gerontology wards, and abortion clinics, and even the womb... And so yes — the outlawing of abortion should be sustained and maintained inviolate if we are to continue a civilization.

Simply put, a fetus is either a person or it isn't. And either you know that or you don't:

Is a person + know it + abortion = Murder
Is a person + don't know it + abortion = Manslaughter
Is not a person + don't know it + abortion = Criminal Negligence
Is not a person + know it = Not Proven"

Also in the story of the serpent, if the serpent wanted anything other than the suffering of man then why wouldn't it tell Adam and Eve to quickly eat of the tree of life. Maybe in defying God and being given the consequences, being betrayed by the serpent and losing paradise, they learned of lies and betrayal, in being thrown out of the garden, the learned of regret, so maybe the tree of good and evil wasn't what they learned in the second but what they and the rest of mankind would learn throughout history. Jealously was learned by Cain, murder was learned through Abel and on and on. Maybe God created a story that was to unfold on its own freewill. Imagine creating a book that would reveal itself and the pages fill on their own, the Greatest story ever told, the bible is alive, and God being a fair God gave us a pathway back to paradise and an instruction manual to get there.

I will throw up a discussion I had with a Hebrew friend in regards to an alternate translation.

 genesis 1:31
- Interestingly, ""Va-yira""/""Va-yaar"" (the first word) is also the root for fear
- So a slightly awkward interpretation of the same phrase could be along the lines of:
""And G-d feared all that he had done, and this was very good""
-Hebrew is a nifty language
-""fear"" may be too strong. ""apprehension"" maybe
-G-d was apprehensive of all that he had done, and this was very good
* wary
- yes
- Yir'a is the pious fear man should have of the divine. same root is used
- it's a type of trembling humility

given the development and implementation of a highly complex system an intelligent architect would be ""wary"" understanding the potential for failure in complexity and it is this wariness (a requirement for attentiveness) that is good"

1. paradise is destroyed when you design society in a way that takes outliers into account, and that destroys all progressive and liberal ideologies.
2.  women are high in agreeableness and therefore the only way to survive is to not listen to anything they say.

Jordan, by saying that the fiminists are wrong because adam was also made to look bad, is like a parent who says that one sibling hitting the other sibling is the same as the sibling who got hit and was hitting back in self defense...  All order, all justice, all hierarchy, is based on an accurate understanding of first cause, those who were the instigators, the responsible party, are at the most fault.  it is important ""who started it"", and therefore eve does desearve the brunt of the responsibility for the fall.  Jordan's liberal interpretation is typical boomer nonsense, that you raise your children the same and when one does wrong you punish all of them so they socialize each other, this creates feminized boys and feminist girls.. it is absolutely wrong.  the person most responsible, the person who started it, the person who knowingly transgressed first is the weakest link and is therefore the most worthy of punishment.  That is how you instill a sense of justice in men instead of guilting them into cow towing to feminist dictates, by guilting men by saying ""you are just as bad as the woman"" you are ignoring cause and effect, that is the essence of liberal leftism.

Feminists are absolutely correct in saying this is an anti woman story, they are absolutely correct, it is the job of a man when truly understanding this story is to say ""yes it is against women, but if I want to survive I had better stop listening to what women say"".  there has never bee a civilization that has been saved because it gave rights and a voice to women but there are ENDLESS examples of societies which have been destroyed by giving rights to women.  The only civilization thriving on the planet at the moment is Islam BECAUSE they do not listen to women.  
The Arabs have appropriated our infalliable survival mechanism because they know the bible needs to be taken literally in order for it to work.  To liberalize the bible, to say what Jordan says that ""the bible has literally infinite interpretations"" is a devastating progressive lie, it is post modernism, Jordan is the snake offering you the fruit of liberalism, saying that the word of god has different meanings, he is that snake he warns you about and he does this so he can sell you alternatives to universities, which of course is a lesser of two evils but as the adam and eve story points out, when you make decisions based on liberal interpretations of the law, of the story, you get tossed from the garden."

UggBxRjnlBcE73gCoAEC,TheHelleri,1503284565911,"1:26:35 I think frozen is one of Disney's best moral lesson movies to date. The younger princess does the whole fall in love with the prince in the first 5 minutes thing. Her older sister, with whom she is estranged, forbids the marriage. She even points out to her younger sister that she shouldn't go all in with a guy she literally just met. And what happens? The prince turns out to be a total dick who was just using her. Meanwhile she goes through an ordeal with the ice harvester and forms a much better relationship with him. Which isn't necessarily romantic by the end. But still a good relationship. And what ends up actually saving the day is familial love. The sisters had not been on good terms for some. But they were still family. And the importance of family wins out.

I don't think Disney had a ""progressive"" agenda with Frozen. I think the main thread of the message was about the bonds we loose or gain and the ideal order of importance of those bonds. That how long you know a person or how much you've been through with them to large degree determines how important they are to your life.

And that's just one way to look at the movie. There are many threads running through it. The whole we can be our own worst enemies' thing. _ Or the _pride comes before the fall aspect. There isn't really a single protagonist or antagonist. Every character that gets a decent amount of screen time is a little bit of both. The movie enforces the idea of personal responsibility.

I would have thought (you being an author and a thinker) that you'd take of the political blinders and see the greater depth here. Because it's actually a really written and portrayed tale that has a lot of dimensions to it. For being fantasy it is a lot more realistic, with many more practical lessons, than anything Disney has done in the past."

The problem with the fall is the judgment we place on our self and others and what happens to us when we let that judgment get under our skin or control us or our ego. 
The name of the tree is, ""The tree of the knowledge of good and evil"". What fruit does that knowledge produce? The answer: Judgment. 
Eating the fruit means letting your judgment get under your skin. Grace is holding that fruit in your hand but not eating it. Forgiveness is spitting the fruit back out after you do eat it. Mercy is getting offended, staying offended but then handing out a suspended sentence [usually to facilitate some kind of bargain, contract or exchange]. 
God said, ""It is good"". That means that he has the capacity for judgment but that doesn't mean he let's it control his emotions. He told Cain to ""master his sin"". The story about the tree of judgment explains how to do that."

Ugjtx3T27Z-QJXgCoAEC,shotinthedark90,1503284569638,"1. God's rest indicates fulfilled purpose, not a projection of our exhaustion and need for recuperation. Like an artist, God creates until His image is expressed in the creation, and then he stops because it's complete. That's Shalom, or peace and wholeness. It's an expression of the state of union between God and man, the Sabbath. That's why Jesus calls himself the lord of the Sabbath, the man in whom the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.

2. Insofar as culture exists pre-cataclysm, work exists pre-cataclysm. So there is a mode of work that is not the sacrifice of present for future under the tyranny of death's sickle.

3. The eating of the fruit indicates a sacrifice of the sacred in order to acquire natural benefit/advantage. The fundamental disagreement I have with Peterson here is his interpretation of the ""fall"" as a sort of evolutionary ""increment"" into full human consciousness. This places humanity in the category of animal, differentiated only by a difference in degree rather than kind. I think that full human consciousness is union with and consciousness of the divine, which is already present before the fall. So the prohibition against the eating of certain fruit is the fundamental distinctive between human and animal: animals do not differentiate what they can and can not do in the natural world on the basis of sacredness/obedience to their spiritual faculty of conscience before God. Self-consciousness, insofar as it is a devolution from the psyche in paradise or shalom, is not the fundamental distinctive. Humans are essentially different from animals even before their psychological self-ignorant cloak is removed. And in fact, the biblical stories bear out that the more self-conscious, self-concerned, and self-protective human beings become, the more they devolve into animal-like modes of being. Hence Nebuchadnezzar eats grass with his livestock and the prodigal son eats slop with his pigs and Absalom publicly rapes his father's wives in order to demonstrate his dominance and ascendance to the throne. Redemption is the reversal of that, or as Peterson says, the return to a child-like state of being which ""takes no thought for tomorrow"" and is released from slavery to sin/death."

There was a problem for Adam after Eve ate the fruit - I don't think he was being a sniveling little blame shifter like you say. 
Now that Eve had eaten the fruit, she was destined to be cast out - and separated from him forever. So he had the choice of either parting with her forever, or joining her in her future misery. 

Which would YOU have done Jordan? You're such a brave man - would you part ways with your wife - for good - in the situation which SHE created? You were smart enough to not eat the fruit, but your stupid wife killed the cat with her curiosity and wanderlust. Her choice affects YOU now, you idiot. 

If you tell the whole truth about the story you will see the predicament of Adam and read his answer to God in a different context: as an explanation of his new problem which is now a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't choice. 
So he explains that the woman God gave him set up this dilemma - which is fair and truthful - it was NOT his fault, but now he has this awful choice, and because God gave him the woman, he chose to stay with her. 

Eve even explained to Adam the problem when he discovered she ate the fruit, so YOU Jordan have no excuse for not seeing it. Stop being such a damn feminist ass-kisser and tell the whole story. Why did you DELIBERATELY leave out the crucial part of the story, the part that explains Adam's predicament and WHY he willingly ate the fruit knowing what the consequences would be? He loved his wife more than his pride and chose to be with her in hell - like the movie ""What Dreams May Come""."

On the surface, it sounds like a bunch of abstract opinionated thoughts, but you explain them so clearly. Somebody trying to replicate your service, but without the talent to explain extensively, will only be able to tell the abstract story, not the deeper meanings - and I guess that's how the story lives on even without the complete understanding. One only needs to understand the usefulness of the story to pass it on, not necessarily the skill to unfold it. And if they pass it on, they pass it on until someone who has the talent to fully explain them comes along to do just that and revitalize it.

It's not a good or long term solution, but in the absence of any show of courage from females regarding a willingness to actually be equal instead of legally advantaged, there aren't a lot of options.

Aside from that gripe with you though, it's a wonderful series and thank you for efforts to keep us free."

I would like to point out that the figure who crushes the serpent’s head cannot be the “mother”, the text says it’s her seed, the Logos who takes on human flesh and comes into the world through a woman. It makes perfect sens because Adam and Eve, as representatives of humanity before and after fall, have been seduced/ensnared by Satan, they cannot engage him to regain what they lost in their encounter with him. The only Hero of heroes that can confront Satan head on and defeat him (crush his head) is none other than the Logos incarnate, and not the ""protective mother"" we are so accustom to seeing in paintings and in the teachings of the roman catholic church.

Historically, the dragon has been seen as an enemy or beast to be fought and defeated to obtain its treasure, but recently I've noticed dragons being portrayed more often as good creatures. I'm sure I don't need to list all the media in the last hundred years that has cast dragons in the role of friend or steed or even wise mentor.

It is interesting that although both of them disobey and eat, God seems to come looking for Adam as society does as well. The one and only thing I don't agree with the good Dr. on, is the idea that some bitter men just want to shirk all responsibility. There are men like this but the larger body of men, are quite simply saddled with ALL the blame when relationships and marriages fail and are penalised to hell as he should know. God doesn't ask Eve for an accounting and her punishment, while severe, is all meted out in her flesh, desire and subordination to the male. After the fall, the female is officially not on the same level as the male. The man's punishment is greater and extends beyond just working, the ground itself is cursed because of his part and he is culpable
 at a much higher level even as society deals with him thereby fuelling the resentment NOT from responsibility but from the unfair burden of that responsibility and blame relative to the female. Just food I said."

Thank you for all the knowledge and wisdom. 

Isn't it interesting that God creates man and woman in his image as early as the fifth day in Genesis 1:26? We always conceive of Adam and Eve as being the first humans but they aren't created until after God has rested on the seventh day. Isn't that odd? 

Or is Genesis 2 simply going back to Genesis 1 and providing greater detail about what happened? Genesis 2:5 implies that the story is going back to before God had made it rain and before any plants had grown. It also says ""and there was no man to work the ground."" It almost seems Genesis is talking about pre-civilization humans and post-civilization humans, with Adam and Eve being the first humans to establish a ""city"" with agriculture. And further that it's the act of settling a city that allows consciousness and the soul to develop. This would also explain how Cain and Abel are able to find mates who are not their sisters, as I believe they do. 

While God creates man and woman in his image in Genesis 1:26-28, he goes a step further in Genesis 2:7 when he ""breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."" I don't know if it's a fair reading, but I see that as God giving man consciousness or a soul. 

It almost seems Genesis is describing the creation of humans in our current body and brains as the first event on the fifth day but that humans did not become a ""living creature"" until we received the breath from God, which would be consciousness or the soul, I'm  unsure which. It seems to describe two separate instances of creating humans, or two levels of human consciousness. 

Anyone's thoughts welcome. Thanks, Professor. 

Peace,
Billy


Genesis 1:26

Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”


Genesis 1:27

So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.


Genesis 2:5

When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,


Genesis 2:7

then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."

However, they didn't abide by the rules, and they were banished. So, this story, to me, is a metaphorical representation of the unhealthy psychological state of people when they are not grateful, and do not abide by the universal moral laws which were laid out in the biblical texts. Therefore, on an individual basis, we banish ourselves from a heavenly state when we don't abide by these laws."

But one important aspect that it sounds like Dr Peterson hasn't considered much, or atleast doesn't talk about here, is the covenant aspect of it all. The text was written in a culture where covenants were super important, and the fact that Adam and Eve more or less makes a food covenant with the serpent is something that has quite a big impact in the story, since the story of the fall is also a lot about delegation of authority. It is also present in the Cain and Able story where Able's offering is of blood, which has very high value in terms of looking at things from a covenant perspective."

isn't christ a parallel of shiva in this sense? combine this with the references he often use for the tree of life, the fruits and the seeds in his parables, the fact that he said ""If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our ABODE within him"", saint Augustine's said something like ""God became human so that the human can become God"", didn't he?
in that Genesis 3,22 God specifically said to keep the tree of life away from men, but isn't that also what he said about the tree of knowledge of good and evil? so that men could be aware of it and eventually eat its fruits?

I would like to give you some mindblowing information which you might find helpful.. 
As I wrote in a previous post, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is a package of knowledge, which has as far as I know 4 messages.. the object it represents, the meaning of it's shape, it's numerology and its hidden meaning. 

So I want to start with something you said about the Tsaddik at the beginning of your lecture. This is first of all NOT a messianic figure.. everyone can become a tsaddik. The tsaddik is a Hebrew letter צ when you spell out how you say the letter you get this צדיק (which incorporates also the root word of justice) .. this incorporates the following idea : tsad means ""side"" and that leaves the letter kuf ק which is the word for ""monkey"".. so the tsaddik is the one who puts his monkey nature to one side! The ancient way of spelling the letter צ tsaddik is without the kuf.. so then it becomes the one who sides with G-d..(represented by the tiny letter yud "" י "" ). 

How does one do this? Well in Jewish tradition it is by following the 613 commandments given in the Torah.. this is the difference between Judaism and Christianity.. there are no short cuts to redemption in Jewish thought... no one (meaning Jesus) can do the work for you, you have to do the 613 things by yourself. Btw.. non Jews are fortunate in thay they don't have as much to do as Jews.. but still.. their redemption is solely on their own heads.

Next: the tree. Well tree is 2 letters עץ the first ע eyin which is the word for EYE (and is the shape of the eye) and צ which is written ץ at the end of words which is the tsaddik.. so the tree is an amalgamation of sight and the mastery of ones animal nature/siding with G-d. Note that this is a for-echo of the the covenant between the Jews and G-d because they agreed to accept the Torah without knowing what it was.. נעשה ונשמע ""nase unisma""we will do (first) and we will heard (second)... and that is why till today the ""shma"" is recited.. ""hear o Israel..."" because the chose to Jews accept blindly.

The snake is decribed as being sly ערום this is the same word used for nakedity. Notice that this word also begins with the letter eyin which is always a clue of sight and consciousness.

The fruit (according to lectures by rabbis that I have heard) is the way by which the evil which was external to Adam + Eve becomes internalised and intermingled. I have also heard rabbis say that G-d meant for them to eat of the tree after eating of the tree of eternal life .."

I used to be of the mind that abortion was largely a positive option, as i believed (and still do partially believe) that the people who consider abortion likely aren't suited to be parents or don't have the means/resources/willingness to parent and as thus the odds of the child having a good life are realtively low. 

However afting having heard people put forth the arguement that regardless of the odds of a good life the child deserves the right to try and make a proper life for itself and thus we shouldn't abort it, actually made me reconsider my stance a bit and now i'm of the mind that abortion should remain a legal option but it should be socially stigmatized or discouraged so that rather than being a ""oh if things go wrong don't worry you can just get an abortion"" it'd be more like ""in case things go REALLY wrong abortion should be considered (emphasis on considered) 

I think that creates room for the people who have an actual need for an abortion to get one without being socially ostracized or jailed and it should also make it so that society generally discourages abortion rather than encourages abortion."

I had a cat, which are often interpreted as non-reflectively conscious, who DID easily learn to interpret that the mirror reflected herself. All animals, including humans have to LEARN what a mirror is and is dependent upon its need or utility. Of course a wild animal will not initially make sense of their reflection as themselves initially. 

That is one of the most absurd experiments in psychology and stinks more of religious self-justification for our 'superiority' by nature. Note that even the Adam and Eve story only interpreted the realization of wisdom as a curse AFTER-THE-FACT of becoming mature. 

P.S. My cat happened to be deaf! This requires a need to pay more attention to visual and other cues. Her capacity to understand reflection was easy for me to notice. I COULD place a piece of fluff on one ear (while touching both) and she correctly knew how to swipe it off by observing this in the mirror.

UgjAkng12EVn8HgCoAEC,Verbal Learning,1503284616827,"Recently i've been thinking a lot about why people often get very frustrated and angry at the messenger of bad news, and i had a time time grasping why, as the messenger usually doesn't have much if anything to do with the bad news themselves, yet people channel their anger onto the messenger and i always felt that was a very irrational thing to do as the problem exists in some form or another outside of the messenger and their message. However when Peterson mentioned about an our or so into this lecture that things don't ""really"" exist until we name them, it made me realize that's exactly why people get so angry and frustrated with the messenger. I mean it's in some ways obvious and i think people are generally aware of this concept in some form but now it's much more clear to me what exactly it is that unfolds in such a scenario (or at least so i think, i could be wrong)

If a person is either willfully ignorant or completely oblivious to a problem, then consciously and sub-consciously the problem either doesn't exist or is incredibly vague and undefined and something you just look away from so you don't have to acknowledge it, but as soon as someone else points out the existence of this problem it either seemingly manifests itself out of nowhere or becomes uncomfortably sharp and in focus for the person who is ignoring the problem and rather than attributing the escalation/awareness/discomfort of seeing a problem so clearly, to their own ignorance or unwillingness to address said problem, they instead attribute it to the messenger, as to them the messenger is or has become the conduit that summoned forth the problem which previously wasn't there."

From the perspective of a photon, the instant its created is the same instant its absorbed by your retina. From the perspective of a photon, it doesn't exist as a little particle chugging along at the speedy of light, it exists as a long strand, from the star its created in to the atom in your retina for an instant in time, meaning the exact point in time it exists is the same exact same time it doesn't exist again. Or another way to look at it, is that, to the photon, there is no space between the atom in the star and the atom in you're eye, and there is no time, or at least that the photon doesn't interact with either, so that they're irrelevance. So the photon interacts with both atoms as though they were interacting themselves. 

It's not so much that the photon wouldn't have been emitted at all (get confusing when talking about something thats existence is so tentative), but that the interaction is part of its existence, or in other words, there is never a photon that's emitted that is never absorbed by something (theoretically). Of course that photon could have been absorbed by something else, but in that to the photon, the interaction is part of the photon in an instant in time, would it be the same photon? Like if you were born to different parents, would you still be you? If the universe is infinite, there is an exact copy of you, with your exact thoughts, reading and these exact words written by an exact copy of me watching a talk of an exact Jordan Peterson giving the exact same talk, is that person you or not you? In the same way, the photon is not the same photon if it were absorbed by something else, but its essentially the same, and it kinda doesn't matter. 

And eventually you fall into nihilistic thoughts.

Perhaps the induction of evil, was basically a named and controllable form of chaos , a form of chaos that was bound and didn't let us unravel like an encounter with  real chaos (post-modernists * cough *) .

By giving us 'evil' it was an introduction to chaos, to open out eyes, and equipped us to deal with small adventures into chaos, slowing building up our knowledge over time, revealing more and more of the universe and reality.

It’s only in resent time that it was mistaken, and replaced with the rod of Hermes (the double helix snake). Hermes is considered a god of transitions and boundaries, someone who can move freely between the worlds of the mortal and divine. He is also portrayed as an emissary and messenger of the gods.

there was this question at the end, where the intertwined snakes get associated with DNA. I don't think that one should take that leap in quite that fashion. Let me suggest a much better path of interpretation how double-helixes are so important.

The double helix is a recurring pattern in nature. It represents a stable state for two strands that are under an unstable tension.

Think of making a rope. If you twist a strand it is in an unstable state. One way to ease the tension is to let in unravel and disperse into fibers again. The second way is to take a second strand under the same tension and twirl it up as a double helix. And suddenly you have a rather strong rope.

The same can be seen in nature in a variety of places, for example in vines.

If you take that picture, the double helix is a symbol of a new stability out of two unstable parts. And strength of the unity, for example in a rope, exceeds the strenth of the parts by far. You can apply this to relationships with far more ease and it makes a much better metaphore.

I think this is a far more sophisticated origin story than speculating about early humans dreaming up DNA. Although the double helix of the DNA follows the same prinicple of falling into a stable low-energy state, this is only a sign of the recurrence of this pattern."

It's thousands of years of accumulated knowledge of how to live and organize society. Told through stories and metaphors.
The question is whether people are convinced to behave morally without the literal belief in God, heaven and hell, the carrot and the stick if you will. If we can convince people that heaven and hell are right here on earth depending on how they live their life then I think it would work for many.

Abra Kadabra.

The word Abracadabra may derive from an Aramaic phrase meaning ""I create as I speak."" This etymology is dubious, however, as אברא כדברא in Aramaic is more reasonably translated ""I create like the word."" In the Hebrew language, the phrase translates more accurately as ""it came to pass as it was spoken.""

[A]bracadabra may comprise the abbreviated forms of the Hebrew words Av (Father), Ben (Son) and Ruach Ha Codesch (Holy Spirit), though an alternative derivation relates the word to Abraxas, a god with snakes for feet who was worshiped in Alexandria.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abracadabra

Here are some of the things that are so intertwined in the Bible, Christ said he is the alpha and the omega. Beginnings and endings are more interconnected in the bible than you think:

Revelation 20
1Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the Abyss, holding in his hand a great chain. 2He seized the dragon, the ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 

Revelation 12:4
His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky, tossing them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman as she was about to give birth, ready to devour her child as soon as He was born.

Revelation 12:9
And the great dragon was hurled down--the ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
 
Genesis 3:15
""And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.""

Luke:

31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,
33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.""
34 And Mary said to the angel, ""How will this be, since I am a virgin?""
35 And the angel answered her, ""The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.

Revelation 12

The Woman and the Dragon
12 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 5 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”

The meaning is three fold or even 4: Eve, Israel, Mary and the Church. Women are are usually more communal and social of the two sexes therefore the represent the community or the family (descendants). 

And the seed (Chist) is how the child (us) should be, perfect union of the father and mother, therefore we are to emulate Christ."

Ugitqk-0xuG3bXgCoAEC,Walter Peretiatko,1503284670765,"What cures is Truth?  What about the idea that the brain does not know the truth from unreality, that if you pretend to be cheerful your mind will go along with it even though you aren't.  It's a psychological technique used by people to fool themselves into happiness.

Cortical expansion?  Is that what accounts for consciousness?  If so, say so.  But the last time you said is that we don't know anything about consciousness.  So what is it?

I thought that you were going to make the step away from metaphor.  That metaphor points to a reality that exists... like GOD!  Not just a reality that we subjectively experience and, had we not experienced it, it would not exist!   No!  A real reality.  A reality that is the footing, the chair on which all other reality will sit -- whether subjective or not.

There is a plot that runs through the Bible starting from the plot of land called Eden.  The plot running from one perfection (Eden) to the final perfection (New Jerusalem) is like the waging of a snake's tongue to memorize us, to lull us into a sleep filled journey so that we will eventually look at the jewel encrusted in the snake's forehead.  Adversity is the setting of this jewel to bring out the Logos and sorrow of existence.  Because of life's pain we cry subliminal tears into the infection of oblivion, and the deep abyss of sorrow is filled up to become a lake of tears so that Jesus could walk on the waters.  Jesus walks on our tears and its faith that hold's him and us up.  Sleep is the balm of life... our life is rounded by sleep."

It's like one day I have it all figured out, and then the next I do something so incredibly stupid and suddenly I realize that everything that I thought was good, isn't. I'm sick of the facades. I'm sick of putting up my own facades. I just wish I knew how to be exactly who I am. Not who I want to be, but who I am. I feel like a pushover, I feel so passive. But I question if the only reason I feel that way is because I'm comparing myself to other people. I wish I could just stop doing that. I wish I could be secure in who I was. I wish I didn't need to pump my head up full of grandeur just to counterbalance my dissatisfaction with myself and my life. I don't feel like I'm actually all that smart. And the truth is...I'm probably not. Having interests in things other people don't have doesn't mean Shit when you continue to put yourself on the same level as them.  I'm insecure because I'm broke, because my house is a mess, I'm fat, my girlfriend is amazing but she doesn't fit these vain preconceived notion that I have... I don't click with anyone the way I want too. I don't have any real friends, partially because I'm judgemental, yet understanding all at the same time. I see thing I don't like and in order to not be cast out, I don't speak on them. I don't speak my mind, I don't say what I mean. I'm afraid to come off like an arrogant asshole. I'm afRaid to acknowledge that maybe I am an arrogant asshole. I want to be liked. I don't want to be the type of person that wants to be liked but...I just do. I want people to look at me and see me as something, so that way maybe I'll see myself as something. I just don't have anything. All these brains, all this wisdom and I have nothing to show for it. Why do I need things? Why is it that the things that make me up are so material??

I just want to escape. I want to run away to a place where life isn't what it is here. I want to wake up everyday, pick fruit from the trees, sit amongst a circle of people I truly like... and laugh, get high, share food. Tell jokes and stories. Hell who knows have orgies haha. But my life is SOO incredibly far from that. It's like my soul got out in the wrong place. The type of person my background and life calls for is simply not the person I am...I just want to finally be happy, to be free from all the burdens. I want all the treasures of facing the dragon, without actually facing that dragon...and...that makes me a coward. Perhaps I'd even face the dragon if I knew it wouldn't crush me and the people I love. Part of me knows what I have to do. I have to uncover stones I've been covering for years. I did something terrible. I took advantage of my little sister, someone whom I was supposed to protect. It makes me sick to think I did that so long ago. The mistakes I've made as a young teenager have gone on to define who I am long into adulthood. It makes me afraid to think that one day it could all come flooding back to her and the world will finally see me for what I am. A sick individual who is trying to create the image that he is better than he actually is. And in that pursuit I only end up dragging myself down more. When I was really young, maybe 4 or 5, another kid did to me what someone was probably doing to him. And it continued for years. I don't know how it's affected me. I don't feel anything when I think about it...and I don't know what that means. I love and I hate my own mother. That makes me feel sad beyond belief. I feel as though she has put everybody in her life above me besides her other kids. And I wonder if they feel that too. I feel like the monster within my own basement. I feel as though my only hope is to continue pushing forward because if I stop for one second, the ground beneath me will collapse. My father was never apart of my life the way he should have been, and the sad part is, I'm still longing for that acceptance. I'm still longing to be one of the guys. 

Now I'm a broke college student. I'm poor, but I have far more now than I did as a kid...which ultimately still isn't much. I'm unsure if pursuing my degree in Clinical Psychology is the right choice. I don't know if I'm doing it because I actually want the degree, or I am doing it because I want to finally get the look of approval from those around. For my own country to even look at me and accept me. The alternative is work my ass off at mediocre jobs just to have an apartment and a car, just to feel for a year or two that I'm actually making progress. I just want to feel like I'm finally getting ahead. I want to feel as if I'm facing the dragon, and actually putting a dent in it. I feel better after articulating this. Hopefully someone else can offer me some insight. Or just confirm the things I already feel to be true about myself...."

And hey, Doc, it fits with the idea that women's rising standards is what spurred men on to consciousness. It was men's love drive that woke them up.

In that book, Solomon lays out how he had acquired more wealth and more wisdom than all who were before him in Jerusalem.  That's how he puts it.  And he realizes that wisdom, wealth, mirth and so on, are all vanity, in an ultimate sense, and vexation of the spirit.  That life is suffering, and that even the rich man's wealth affords him no sleep, while the labourer, though suffering, sleeps well, whether he eats well or not.  And at the end of the day everything is vanity: vanity of vanities, all is vanity.  But, after negating everything worthwhile about life, he gives an antidote. And that is to follow God's law, for that is the whole duty of man.

Now, I don't believe in ""God"" with a capital G.  But I take that to mean that you shouldn't be focused on the outcome, but rather be focused on living life like a good human being.  It is a duty that you owe to yourself and your fellow people.  And I find that this a good cure for the disappointment that too much hope in the fulfillment of any single goal will bring.

This  quote is from Book 12 after Adams witnesses the unfolding of history after the fall.

UgjS808W593lb3gCoAEC,Scott Mayers,1503284701627,"I think there is a complete misinterpretation of the Adam and Eve story because it has TRANSFERED a secular philosophical inspection into a cartoon. Like we favor things like Family Guy, the Simpsons, and South Park, the initial biblical stories derive from social AND, especially with respect to many Genesis writings,  pre-scientific/philosophical natural reflections on our world. Your interpretation here Jordan appears to be one of a post-religious interpretation. You come from a prior religious belief you were raised in and then try to mold it afterwards. To actually be fair, try assuming the original writings NOT as religious literal ideas but cartooning intended to aid in the memory to pass on what used to be a secular and philosophical understanding, NOT an 'esoterical' reflection that you appear to be interpreting this as.

For example, note how ""Adam"", ""atom"", ""Aten"", ""item"", and other words in various evolved languages relate. ""Aten"" was likely a more original interpretation of the single common source of perfection represented by the SHAPE of the sun. ""Atum"" (with the 'm') is the less perfect reflection of what is able to be shaped on Earth. Thus, ""Atum"" and then ""Adam"" meant the reflected Earthy form shaped as the sun. Adam is thus, ""mankind', not a particular man.

""Eve"", while cartooned as a woman, is ALL humans that follow and how we derive words like, ""evening"" and ""ever"", etc. Note too that Eden (note the 'n') is the Aten's rising form (where the sun rises as a source)....the 'place' of where the heavenly sun that we can't actually ever get to. Thus this is the reasoning for explaining why we cannot BE where the sun is (no Eden access). 

Even the story about how Adam's rib was taken ignores that the likely original interpretation was that this 'rib' was a reference to the penis as a bone, NOT a rib specifically. It represented a secular explanation that all humanity born derives from sex.

The 'original sin' is NOT likely about 'sin' as it NOW has evolved to be interpreted as. It just refers to the FACT that we naively begin as children wanting to always grow up only to be cursed for discovering the wisdom  that our very naivete IS the ideal paradise. It helped to justify (by cartoon) why humans are 'cursed' to be as the gods of Earth over all animals, suffer by requiring to kill and struggle, and to recognize that Death itself is a relatively 'fair' reality given the curse of burden of knowledge. 

I have much to say on this but was only trying to show how that your apparent interpretation, while not unhelpful, is just a reinterpretation of reinterpretations that likely miss the more philosophical AND 'natural' realities all people share at the time from the many different multicultural stew of the Middle East. It was not likely 'religious' at all but rather secular. You seem to be just reshaping FROM the latter diffusion of the original. This is like interpreting meaning of some game of telephone by trusting the point at which you heard being at the end of the line. You're trying to remake sense of the noise's perspective rather than the likely source."

THE HEPTADIC STRUCTURE 
The recurrence of seven—or an exact multiple of seven—is found throughout the Bible and is widely recognized. The frequent occurrence of the number seven is conspicuous even to a casual reader. We encounter the seven days of creation in Genesis, the seven feasts of Israel, seven days of rain after Noah enters the ark, seven days between the doves, Jacob serves seven years for each of his two wives, seven kine and ears of corn in Pharaoh’s dreams (seven good years and seven famine years), seven lamps of the Menorah, the seven elements of furniture in the Tabernacle, seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the repeated use of seven in the Levitical priestly instructions, the seven weeks to the Feast of Weeks, the seven months between Nisan and Tishri (and the seven years of the sabbatical year, and the seven times seven to the Jubilee Year), the seven priests with seven trumpets circling Jericho seven times in the Book of Joshua, seven nations of Canaan, Solomon was seven years building the Temple, Naaman washed seven times in the river, seven loaves fed the four thousand, etc. In the Book of Revelation we encounter seven churches, seven lampstands, seven stars, seven seals, seven horns, seven spirits of God, seven angels, seven trumpets, seven thunders, seven crowns, seven last plagues, seven bowls, seven kings, and there are many more sevens, much more subtle in their presence. The more closely one examines the text, the more evident is the recurrence of seven. 
        Even in the interior design of the text, we continue to encounter this heptadic structure. Take the opening verse in Genesis chapter 1, for example: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Number of Hebrew words: seven; Number of letters: 28 = 4 x 7; First three words: 14 letters, 2 x 7; Last four Hebrew words: 14 letters = 2 x 7; Fourth and fifth words have seven letters; Sixth and seventh words have seven letters; Three key words: God, heaven, earth have 14 letters; = 2 x 7 Four remaining words have 14 letters = 2 x 7 (Hebrew letters also each have a numerical value [gematria], so even the numerical values of the letters [and words] are provocative. The numeric value of first, middle, last letters = 133, = 19 x 7; the numeric value of the first and last letters of all seven words is 1393 = 199 x 7. 
We also find this in the New Testament. 
        A DESIGN CHALLENGE Consider the following assignment. Try designing a genealogy, even from fiction, which meets the following criteria:   1. The number of words in it must be divisible by seven evenly. (In each of these constraints, it is assumed that the resulting divisions are without any remainders.)   2. The number of letters must also be divisible by seven. (Not too difficult so far? But let’s include a few more constraints:)   3. The number of vowels and the number of consonants must also each be divisible by seven. (Getting more challenging? Let’s add a few more.)   4. The number of words that begin with a vowel must be divisible by seven.   5. The number of words that begin with a consonant must be divisible by seven. (Let’s add some frequency constraints:)   6. The number of words that occur more than once must be divisible by seven.   7. The number of words that occur in more than one form shall be divisible by seven.   8. The number of words that occur in only one form shall be divisible by seven. (Now let’s add some constraints on the grammatical structure:)   9. The number of nouns shall be divisible by seven. 10. Only seven words shall not be nouns. 11. The number of names in the genealogy shall be divisible by seven. 12. Only seven other kinds of nouns are permitted. 13. The number of male names shall be divisible by seven. 14. The number of generations shall be 21, also divisible by seven. 
        A challenging assignment, indeed! Could you do it? If you encountered such a genealogy, would you attribute such characteristics as these to random chance? These have all been met in the first 11 verses (in the Greek) in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 1. 
   The heptadic (sevenfold) structure of the Bible has been much studied and the subject of numerous volumes in the past,124 but none are more provocative than the works of Dr. Ivan Panin.  DR. IVAN PANIN Ivan Panin was born in Russia on December 12, 1855. Having participated in plots against the Czar at an early age, he was exiled and after spending some years in study in Germany, came to the United States and entered Harvard University. After graduation in 1882, he converted from agnosticism to Christianity. In 1890 he discovered some of the phenomenal mathematical design underlying both the Greek text of the New Testament and the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. He was to devote over 50 years of his life to painstakingly—exhausting his health—exploring the numerical structure of the Scriptures, generating over 43,000 detailed, hand-penned pages of analysis. He went on to be with the Lord in his 87th year, on October 30, 1942. Ivan Panin noted the amazing numerical properties of the Biblical texts. These are not only intriguing to discover, they also demonstrate an intricacy of design which testifies to its supernatural origin!

UgiY02R_4X_NQngCoAEC,khaii13,1503284709508,"It's quite an insight to see how the stories of the Bible progresses from the old testament salvation found in state (from the law, to the judges, then kings, then prophets) to the new testament salvation through the individual psyche. The implications and ramifications of this interpretation is mind blowing or even game changing to say the least, as it creates, at the very least, a more intellectually acceptable rationale for following in Jesus's example. 

Growing up with a strict Methodist family, on an extremely Christian country, I grew up to question the dogmas of my religion at an early age. I think I even went to a nihilistic phase at some point. But I never was quite sold on all the arguments against Christianity either. I've had an idea in my head as to why, but I could never had articulated it in such a powerful way as Professor Jordan B. Peterson did here, so thank you very much for that, man, first and foremost. 

More importantly, can anyone of us buckoneers in here imagine a world in which the way Christianity is taught in this way? Where we move past the fundamentalist rhetoric? Where, maybe the Bible can't be added to anyway, but at least that those stories are taught and shared at this level of abstraction; where we let go of judgment of all other religion and the argument of whether this is the ONLY TRUE RELIGION (path)? Where each Christian is actually empowered to their full potential (God empowered) instead of merely being God dependents, or just developing for the sake of the church, or gaining salvation simply through grace alone without any sense of responsibility... What would our current world be like once we render the weapons that murdered God at the turn of the industrial revolution finally powerless and revivify our relationship with the collective wisdom that has survived for tens of thousands of year?"

Comments and discussion are welcome, I am considering working on this in a bit more depth. Don’t hesitate to contact me at Sander.Beckers [at] cornell [dot] edu

START:
1. E-mail to Dr. Peterson, on June 6th:

Hi Dr. Peterson, (or anyone else who might be reading this),

you must be extremely busy, so I’ll sacrifice eloquence for brevity. Let me stress that I very much like your talks and lectures. Still, there are a number of issues which I think are left unaddressed, at least in the videos that I’ve seen.

To keep it very short, here’s a brief description: as a philosopher, I’m sceptical of putting too much weight on evolutionary explanations of our current culture. For the most part, biological evolution has all but stopped about 50,000 years ago (the cognitive revolution), because from then onwards it has been dominated by cultural evolution. What human history shows, is that our biological constraints and determinants are extremely limited compared to other organisms. (Of course they’re still very strong in an absolute sense, I fully agree with that!) 

Yet I sometimes get the impression that you move from the mere description of our biological determinants, to them being normative. (For example, I am thinking of your various references to the hierachical structure of chimpansee communities, as being explanatory for much of our current behaviour and the differences between men and women.) But of course is does not imply ought. Consider for example the fact that in our culture there are communities who abstain from sex completely (priests and nuns). If anything goes against natural selection, certainly that does. So a distinction should be drawn between the scientific debate, regarding how humans actually behave and why they do so, and the moral debate, regarding how humans should behave. Obviously the former informs the latter, but it doesn’t have the last word.

I take it that the most interesting disagreement between you and the postmodern left is about what our current culture is, and how it came about. As a consequence of that disagreement, there is a disagreement about what is valuable about our current culture, and this ultimately leads to the disagreement about what our culture should be. 

In my opinion, your contributions are extremely pertinent regarding the first disagreement, precisely because they will help people change their views on the second disagreement, and this in turn will make people more modest regarding the third disagreement. (In short, it will make them more conservative.) I don’t think any of this goes against what you say, but adding these clarifications might help get people on board with your views who might otherwise be reluctant to do so.

Keep up your incredible work!

Best,
Sander

Well, these people would disagree. And evolution never stops: https://www.amazon.ca/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accelerated/dp/0465020429

Regardless: 

re ""I sometimes get the impression that you move from the mere description of our biological determinants, to them being normative."" 

They are normative, but that isn't the same as ideal (as you point out). I'm not suggesting that we adopt chimp norms as ideal (although their stable leaders aren't mere power hungry dictators). I also do believe that it is worthwhile taking into consideration what is, when moving to an ought. It's certainly easier that way. There's just no certain path from one to the other. 

This is a fine summary:

I take it that the most interesting disagreement between you and the postmodern left is about what our current culture is, and how it came about. As a consequence of that disagreement, there is a disagreement about what is valuable about our current culture, and this ultimately leads to the disagreement about what our culture should be.

Thanks for your reply, I greatly appreciate it! I have a follow-up related to your Biblical lecture series. (Again, I’ll try to keep it as  short as possible.) I’ll be attending your lecture in two days, so feel free to address this topic there, in case you would consider it useful for others to hear your thoughts on this too. 

To put it bluntly, my question is this: if human nature by itself can explain why the Old Testament was written, then why did different cultures (arising out of the same human nature) write such vastly different religious works?


My general impression of what you’re trying to do in those series, is to use your vast knowledge of history, science, and philosophy, to interpret the Old Testament. You have repeatedly stated that you prefer not to take a position regarding its metaphysical status. However, the mere fact that such a sensible interpretation is even possible, in itself implies that there is some justification for taking the message of the Old Testament to be saying something deeply profound about human existence. At first a Christian might be delighted to hear this, because it offers credibility to their view that this work does in fact contain the word of God. But looking more closely, a problem arises.

A substantial portion of your explanations invoke evolutionary and psychological mechanisms, and you stress that these have evolved for millions of years. Therefore these mechanisms are not limited to Western culture, but have influenced human societies everywhere. If these mechanisms explain the existence of the Bible, then I presume that the same holds for other religious works and traditions. In Saudi-Arabia there might be a Muslim Dr. Peterson, who’s giving a lecture series on the significance of the Qu’ran, in India there might be another Dr. Peterson, giving similar talks regarding the Upanishads, etc. 

A scientist would welcome that conclusion, for if it’s true then it offers strong confirmation that the explanations that you offer are correct. A humanist would likewise applaud this conclusion, for it might lead the way to a universal morality once and for all: if all of these works are simply different manifestations of the same human struggle, then we can strip away the contingent details to find a common core that captures universally shared values. 

Yet taking these religions seriously involves accepting the claim that their views are in direct conflict with one and other. Just a few days ago a US government official was scolded by Bernie Sanders for claiming that Christians believe that Muslims stand condemned. Even a non-religious person who studies all of these works carefully should conclude that the differences between them are too significant to brush aside. Therefore any explanation that is based solely on evolutionary and psychological mechanisms cannot by itself account for all of these different traditions, and their specific contents. 

Inevitably the missing part would have to be filled in by cultural elements. Of course you often do invoke cultural elements, by referring to the works of Western thinkers. But I don’t think you do so in order to contrast the Old Testament with other religious works. But that is what would be required to explain why the Old Testament didn’t end up being the Qu’ran, or some other work, and why it is of more value than other religious works (if that is indeed what you believe). Further, these explanations would have to involve contingent historical aspects of particular cultures, rather than universally shared properties of the human condition, implying that they will not be grounded in biology or psychology. 


I’ll keep it at that. 

Let me conclude with saying how grateful I am for what you are doing. It’s so rare these days to encounter an academic who goes against the narrow minded scientistic utilitarianism that has become prevalent in many disciplines, while at the same time going against the narrow minded unempirical relativism that has become prevalent in many others. If there’s anything that I’m certain of, then it’s the fact that a profound appreciation for the mystery of existence is the logical endpoint for anyone who engages in sincere and thorough rational thinking.

Best,
Sander
