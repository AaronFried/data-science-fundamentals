Unfortunately the reality is Peterson just has an ability to articulate in such away that even I find clairvoyance with many thoughts that haven't been stirred by being ""at church"".

Nonetheless the truths remain the same and they speak for themselves and I'm exceptionally grateful that anyone is articulating this because if I know how much I need it and how vital it's been for my restoration on all levels I know that Gods word can accomplish that in you too.

UgwppqTkd9NYvUrbtKl4AaABAg,avadonna,1534561233305,"It is an odd thing to me, the fact that Jordan Peterson is so popular and loved ( the fact that he's also hated is less surprising). My personal observation of human nature and human history has, up till now, lead me to believe that in their masses people are no fans of the concept of self awareness and personal acountability. The wide spread of identity politics, SJW etc is definitely further proof of this sad notion. Yet the fact that Dr. Peterson is able to bring his message across to such a large and receptive audience means that western society still has hope. It shows that we have a genuine need for radical honesty, as opposed to self indulgent righteousness and blatant hypocrisy. It shows that many of us actually prefer to live as thinking individuals, who continue to evolve, develope and learn, rather than dangling like puppets who thouthlesly repeat political slogans and moralistic cliches. This is incredibly significant, and so, so encouraging. I want to thank Dr. Peterson for speaking, but I also want to thank all the people who are able to listen and actually hear. It is not something to be taken for granted."

Well the New Testament that he accepts better states that God is the exact same God yesterday, today and forever!! Jesus is exclusive and frankly states “I AM the way, the truth, and the Life! No one comes to the Father but through me!” Lots of writers have done what Jordan is trying to do and did a lot better job but they do not tickle the ear like Jordan does for some reason. Try Thomas Merton or Saint Augustine. God created it all and nothing created him. I’ll keep listening as it is entertaining and funny most of the time. Not too profound."

We know that things can go very very badly wrong if you do things very badly wrong, there’s no doubt about that, but the converse is also true, if you start to sort yourself our properly and you have a beneficial effect on your family, first of all that’s going to echo down the generations but it also spreads out into the community and we are networked together, we’re not associated linearly, we all effect each other and so it’s an open question the degree to which acting out the notion that being is good, and the notion that you can accept its limitations and should still strive for virtue. It’s an open question how profound an effect that would have on the structure of reality if you really chose to act it out. And I’ve seen things in my life that indicate a metaphysical element to life as well as the rational practical element and I think when there are times when those two things come together and I’ve seen that happen, so I don’t think we know the limits of virtue, I don’t think we know what true virtue could bring about if we aimed at it carefully and practically."""
UgxPUhj4ILOoQ7_rio94AaABAg,david fenton,1533610834220,"If a movie is playing and no one is watching is there actually a movie? 
Is it a part of actual reality if it isn’t pressing upon people’s inner person and influencing them in their thinking and living? 
If one speaks and no one hears or listens, does their speaking cause any effect?

Can Things that have their influence through the mind, have any effect in individual or social life if people stop listening or believing? (The underlying principle here is that what people think (are conscious of) is a key cog in how they function. You take certain teeth off that cog, then what they would normally engage with and cause just can’t happen! And if you put certain teeth on people’s consciousness cog, then they will do things that they otherwise wouldn’t) 

John Lennon touched upon this principle when he sang 
“Imagine there’s no heaven, it’s easy if you try, 
No hell below us, above us only sky. 
Imagine there’s no countries, it isn’t hard to do, 
No one to kill and die for and no religion too.” 

Heaven, Hell and Countries are conceptual objects, they only exist in minds playing that movie, but it manifests from their imaginations and becomes a real concern because they think and then act it into reality. BUT it can be dissolved if the imagination that made it, can unmake it. Unfortunately, many can’t dispel their illusionary objects in favour of thinking that better aligns with sensible reality. (Being able to tell the difference between a reality based thought and a conceptual one is an important skill to keep one grounded in sensible reality. Hint: can you point to Heaven, Hell, the Nation which is not it's physical location by the way, or the number 1? None of these things can be pointed to as they are all mental concepts some derive from reality while others are pure fiction.) 

Many false or dysfunctional mental IDEAS have become concretised into reality via institutions because they don’t derive from the natural order which is to:
First OBSERVE reality
Then  KNOW it
Then THINK about how it functions (causality)
And finally ACT according to the causality we know. 
(When we don’t achieve what we were aiming at, it is is because we were out of line with causality and we need to observe reality more closely and refine our thinking and actions to better achieve what we want, subject of course to what is actually achievable)

Maintaining functionality and becoming optimal is achieved by following this natural order to increasing functionality i.e. progress. But when the first step of OBSERVE is replaced with IMAGINE, the foundational attachment to the strength of grounding truth is lacking and stuff falls, collapses and has trouble standing. 

Truth is learned via observation of reality, by using one’s senses. Reality, ‘that which is’ is the source of truth. Knowing truth requires using one’s senses and using reality’s response to our efforts, it is the true teacher. i.e. Reality is the truth and it teaches us all via direct touch upon us through our senses and it shows us just how well we do things by the real world results it gives us. There is no other completely true and complete teacher. 

If you start to build from any place other than reality, i.e. ‘that which is’, then you’ve missed it from the start. Reality is intimately known through sense experience. I am aware of no conscious thought without prior sense experience of reality. Consciousness starts from reality and is knowledge of reality in us via our senses."
UgzP8V4a7WOUxvWTtF54AaABAg,jpesmar,1533610834228,"At around 1:47:00 Peterson talks briefly about how the lack of limitations to the character almost killed the whole Superman franchise, which is correct. However, since there are just a very, very small number of things I think I happen to know more about than  Dr. Peterson, I want to shed some light into why the complete lack of limitation is precisely what makes Superman perhaps the most interesting comic book character, and maybe even how it relates precisely to what Dr. Peterson says about actively trying to reduce a bit the suffering in the world.
Off course, taken to the extreme (which has happened tons of times), the feats of power Superman has displayed is just ridiculous, and frankly boring. He can't technically be killed, and if he is, well the writers just bring him back because they need to sell more comics. When well written, the interesting challenges Superman faces are always moral and ethical challenges.
Superman does what he does because for him, there are basically two options; either rule the Earth to what he thinks earth should be like, and he has the power to do so, or just try to help the whole human kind a bit, inspire people a bit, and sure, punch an alien or two in the way.
He didn't need to get see his parents get shot in an alley like Batman to know crime's bad, or have his uncle practically die due to his irresponsable actions like Spiderman to know that with great power comes great responsibility. He wasn't trained for God knows how many years to be an amazonian warrior princes like Wonder-woman, nor he had a magical ring that contains the wisdom of the universe force upon him to teach him about responsibility and the power of will. He's just a dude from Kansas who has this ridiculous powers, and just does the right thing because somehow he figured it is what makes more sense. Somehow, he figured not even he can know whats best for the whole planet, and that if he were to ""lead"" things, it would probably turn out to be horrible for most people, and he would ultimately lose his humanity.
What's truly interesting about Superman is that he chose to be a decent guy. He could have anything he wants, and still worked on a farm half his life and then got a job in a newspaper from which his basically threatened to get fired from every 3 issues. He chose a human partner (at least in most canon interpretations) to give and receive his love to. 
The fact that he can get up every morning and just ""do what's right"" when he knows for a fact everyone he has ever loved will eventually die maybe hundreds of years before him (if he's even able to die on this solar system), instead of spiralling down into a depression which makes him hate everything and just want to conquer and enslave the whole planet is nothing but remarkable. Why does he even bother with all this human non-sense when he's practically a god walking amongst toddlers? 
That's what really makes him super. He just constantly trying to be a better dude all around.
I'm not saying all Superman stories are all that deep, most of them are pretty much something happens so Supes has to fly in, take a few shots, and then punch some monster into next week, but the fact that the character has lasted for so long, even when people have been calling it dull and boring since the 70's, it's because it is much more relatable than what most people give him credit for.
Anyway, sorry for the rant. It was totally uncalled for."

I have to add negative ideas about #Jordan-Peterson as a person recently made aware to me. He's an #Evolutionist which means that he is a lover or #atheistic-pseudoscience [see https://plus.google.com/collection/oZJB7  Atheistic Pseudoscience Evolutionism GTE ]  since it is impossible to study evil evolutionism that defies scientific laws and principles , that never happened historically and thus cannot have empirical evidence, and forensic evidence, nor eyewitnesses, and that cannot use the scientific method and thus is the reason that there is no experimental reproduction/verification for pond scum to all biological evolutionism or for all the aspects of the GTE.

1:25:31 As you have stated why it is so obvious why questions about the goodness of god exist, what do you have to say in response to the argument that a god both all good and all powerful is a contradiction?

1:30:43 You make the case that the human body cannot be left behind as if it is of no value. With that philosophy, what would you think about the transhumanistic extreme of an entirely artificial android housing a ""perfect copy"" of a human consciousness? And if that's too extreme an example to discuss, an entirely artificial android housing no human part but the brain? I think all sane individuals would agree that a war veteran with an advanced prosthetic leg is still as much a person as they are, so I think my real question is: at what point, if any, do you think the physical aspect of the person can be replaced or in some way altered before one's person-hood begins to deteriorate? This question is actually rather important to me personally as it is one of the common thematic questions of science-fiction (a genera that greatly intrigues me) in general, about what happens when humans transcend their own physical, or even temporal limitations, or at least the temporal limitation imposed by mortality."

We have concept of moral values independent of the concept of higher power like state or for that matter God. This development jordan totally ignores. We no longer need personification of an imagined authority and then having its attributes somehow in all of us for the sake of valuing other human being. We are very well able to do that independent of such mythical figure. That is to say to have so called divine meaning to life without divine.

I have been a thinker for decades(who doesn't think)and have always, well,  after thinking for a long time about the plausability of there being a god as god is represented in pictures i.e. wise face in the sky looking down over us I came to a decision and I felt so strongly about it that I have always stuck with it. I have never asked anyone to think as I do even though I have always been truthfull about  what I think god is - and that is I believe in a human collective goodness =  which wise people and masters of the word and pen thousands of years ago created 

I thought for people to follow good and to avoid bad  (metaphorically speaking,  god v devil). I saw and read about your chaos and order, although I was a world away from thinking that I feel as though the thinking I have stood by all these years has been at least heading in the right direction. I would like to thank you for filling a very large hole in my trying to explain why god is a reflection of our higher being/intelligence/concsciousness and why we brought god to be.
I Admittedly incorporate your chaos and order but make sure I refer to you and quote you when using any of your words.  My payment in kind is to suggest, advise and tell many peers and colleagues to watch you or read your books. I have posted many of your lectures on psychology and philosophy sites and in lots of discussions.

If More highly knowlegable and wise thinkers like yourself shared in the way you do the world would become a better place.

Yung and the likes I believe would of admired you for what your doing as would those hundreds of millions who died in the pre, during and post war genocides.

Thank you.

All the best?

It's not the denial of inherent properties or psychological truths lets say. It's also not the a disbelief in the functions of mythological literature or universal laws and an order to the cosmos. It's simply not believing in a deity of religious canon. That's it. There's no philosophy or dogma attached to it. It's also not a disbelief or denial of some higher ideal, which is what Dr. Peterson usually equates God with. In that sense, someone that doesn't believe in God like myself, does believe or know or act out in the world to some ideal like that, but it's not ""God"" the in the traditional sense and it's not a mind, will or intelligence that is lording over your being, it's just a characteristic of reality that is inherent, more or less coded into the fabric of the universe and all things. 
Just because I enjoy Superman as a character and the stories about him doesn't mean I believe there's a living, thinking, judging entity outside of space-time in some unknown dimension. For some reason, that seems to be his confusion about an atheist's position."

UgyPkvp4d44Mp93tbZ54AaABAg,Todd Ritchey,1532142037103,"In this video Jordan Peterson suggests that chaos and order are two primary opposing forces and that chaos is feminine and order is masculine.  He infers that too much chaos is disastrous, but equally disastrous is too much order.

I suggest that instead of chaos and order that the most fundamental truth of the nature of biology and maybe of the universe is the tension between homeostasis and non-homeostasis.

Even to suggest balance versus entropy in my opinion is not clean enough. I believe you cannot have too much homeostasis.  It would seem incredulous to suggest that you could have too much truth or too much fairness or too much justice. It is easy to see how you could have too much order, but to even make the statement that you can have too much chaos seems somehow counterintuitive or contradictory. Is there really a way of measuring the right amount of chaos? 

It only makes sense if you believe it to be the counterbalance of too much order. This construct doesn’t really make sense to me and to ascribe feminine and masculine characteristics to one or the other also seems like a convenient way to attribute old societal religious or male dominated philosphy to this topic.  There is certainly as much evidence that men or masculinity create as much or more chaos than women or femininity and conversely there is plenty of evidence that women or femininity create or drive towards order. If he is assuming that women tend toward being more emotional, based on societal conditioning I might agree, but conversly then men are more prone to addiction and violence if you take that line of thinking. Which of the two create more chaos? 

The biggest biological drive in men and women and in all of nature is the drive to homeostasis or balance. The drive to homeostasis and non-homeostasis or out of balance states  have biochemical and physiological reinforces that are clearly measurable. In the human experience the most accurate way of describing our collective behaviour, would be to identify it as the drive to homeostasis versus the Addictive Drive. This seems the most accurate representation because it is supported by brain chemistry and at the deepest level is reinforced by the drive towards survival.  This addictive drive only applies to humans and possibly domesticated animals. 

This drive seems diametrically opposed to the homeostatic drive and I believe is at the root of how humans have come to believe in good versus evil and the overall concept of duality. Addiction or addictive behaviour without an understanding of its core components often appears to be insidious or demonic. This is not the case as what happens is the survival centres of the brain are hijacked by the addiction, which ultimately leads to processes that compel one to create either too much chaos or too much order, both of which pull us away from survival and that is non-homeostatic. 

Too much homeostasis or balance is nonsensical but if it were possible, it would just lead to safety, love, health, connection and freedom All those things would be a natural expression when we are not in survival mode. 

My take is that you could suggest that from Jordan Peterson‘s perspective, that a balance between order and chaos is homeostasis and that too much of one or the other is non-homeostasis but even that lacks precision.

This would be the period when our cognitive development rapidly increased, since our previously tree-dwelling ancestors had to compete in a very different biome for which they did not possess adaptations.

Thus, the environment selected for intelligence and bipedalism since we had no physical advantages; we were to become tool-users rather than finely-tuned predators. Consciousness likely emerged during this period. As such, we began to represent reality through stories. Maybe the first grand narrative about who we are was the one that we had been living out for the first few thousand years, which ultimately differentiated ourselves from the other apes and caused us to wake up, so to speak. In a way, it was our first great adventure.

However, there is no association with the serpent and Satan in the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament. That is a Christian interpretation that you are assigning to it; and one that does not occur until the very end of the New Testament, in Revelation 12:9 and 20:2 . . .

JBP says that the concept of ""individual sovereignty"" is at the core of Christianity and Western Civilization.  But I do not believe that the Bible teaches that.  The Bible teaches and glorifies the sovereignty of GOD, not humans.  

The Bible and traditional Christian thought do assign value to each individual human.  But not infinite value.  Only God has infinite value. The value of each human is always infinitely subordinate to the value of Almighty God, who alone is all Good, all True, all Powerful, all Wise.  

In the Bible, when someone called Jesus good, Jesus replied, ""Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.""  (Mark 10:18)

It is blasphemous to speak about the ""sovereignty"" of a human being, from the traditional Christian point of view, since only Almighty God can be sovereign, and all human beings must bow and submit to the sovereignty of Almighty God.  

The sovereign God deserves worship from human beings precisely because He is sovereign.  

Human beings are NOT to worship themselves.  Human beings are not sovereign.  That concept is foreign and blasphemous to Christians.

In traditional Christian thought, the scale is NOT Order vs. Chaos, but instead is Righteousness vs. Unrighteousness (or Holiness vs. Sinfulness).  In traditional Christian thought, an individual person can live a holy life or a sinful life, and a whole society or social order can be holy or sinful in its laws and practices.  

In the Bible, Jesus says: ""Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."" (Matthew 5:6)

Jesus did not say ""Order is blessed.""  

This ""Order vs. Chaos"" of JBP's scale is not found in the Bible or in traditional Christian thought, as far as I know. 

JBP does not seem to have any concept of Social Ethics in his system.  

Since JBP says that Chaos is Feminine, it seems that JBP assumes that any Patriarchial social order will be moral.  But Nazi Germany was a super-Patriarchial social order, yet it was not moral."

Also, he thinks someone liking a story where the good guy heroes win is religious? The ""us against them"" concept predates religion, bucko. All those ideas he talks about predates religion.

Even insects such as ants and mammals such as mole rats exhibit behavior such as altruism and social stratification. They do not descend into chaos like he seems to think that they would if this notion was abolished. Unless, you believe that animals do infact consider each other to be divine or that the belief is ""programmed"" into their genetics. But that notion clearly only applies to an individual species. Lion's may abide by the social stratification of their pride, but have no problem killing the children of antelope.  There is no ""law"" in these social environments, there seems to only be pain and pleasure which drive the behavior of the animals.  Why compare the human species to an animal species? Well, why not? I think that they represent a subset of limited consciousness that is incapable of self-awareness or the appreciation of the divinity of other's and may provide insight into what we would look like if we lacked such a quality.  A human's motivation to treat others with respect does not have to be derived from the innate divinity of human's. I believe that is better understood as a product of evolution. Also, the mind of a person with anti-social personality disorder is not exactly equal to a ""normal"" person's mind minus the belief that each human is divine and deserving of respect. While they do often present with the inability to appreciate the rights of others, your assumption may overlook other factors that contribute to their psychology that give them the proclivity toward violence and destruction. In reality there is most likely a spectrum of how ""anti-social"" any given person is and the ones who do not value to the life of other and also have certain other violent tendencies are at one extreme. However, the middle of the spectrum should not be ignored. I would venture to guess that there are many in society that would rank the value of lives of others as quite low, but do not engage in violent behavior. My point is that you shouldn't assume that because someone does not see each human being worthy of respect, that they will therefore act violently or without civility toward that person.

From the game Destiny, to Attack on Titan, and Game of Thrones to an extent, it always revolves around the archetype that the hero's home, usually a walled city, is encircled by an external Chaos (aliens, White Walkers, Titans). And it it the hero's journey to venture outside the walls and reclaim territory and subdue the Chaos. These stories are still so popular because they seem to poke at a very ancient mythology in the back of our minds."

God is an all consuming fire.   At pentecost tongs of fire sat upon their heads and burned inside their hearts.  Supernatural fire, warmth, love, joy and peace is in this fire, and power - life giving power, life itself, eternal life.   This Holy Spirit lives in the Christian and when a Christian dies this is the power that resurrects them and gives them a glorified body once they enter heaven."
UgwFijGnvRtZ1u238kp4AaABAg,Bachconcertos Whitney,1529550044733,"We cannot understand consciousness fully because this is a falen world.   In a fallen world there are opposites:  order and chaoes, light and dark, good and evil, old and young, hot and cold, life and death, etc. etc.   In heaven there are no opposites.  There is only light, only love, only beauty, only life, only youth, and only freedom, etc.   In hell there i sno opposite:  there is only darkness, only evil,  only hatred, only impresenment.  Hell is total seperation from God.   So when Adam and eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil they fell into a world of opposites.   

God sent his only begotten Son to deliver us from this fallen world, and from hell when we die.   We cannot reach heaven ourselves, and we needed God to save us with his plan, and his plan before the foundation of the world is sending his Son to die on the cross for our sins.   God made us fit to enter heaven with his plan, and the most victorious choice you can make in your life is to accept his Son as  your Lord and Savior. 

 Buddda cannot take you to heaven nor can Budda give you a glorified body when you die.    The Egyptians in Biblical times worsipped false gods but not the true God.  The Israelites were called out to worship the true God and establish the first covenant so that the new covenent could come in to include both Jew and Gentile.  Althouh many religions other than Christ have positive lessons for living right, they cannot bring us into heaven.   Because we cannot enter heaven through only loving or good behavior, but only God through his Son can this miracle happen.  Also, Jesus Christ is not a religion - Jesus did not want to start another religion -It is a relationship with Jesus, a personal relationship.  

In a fallen world, you either sin against others or are sinned upon, or both on occasion,  and if one has a relationship with Christ they can overcome depression, anger, fear, and make less inpulsive reactions to any injustice - you have to realize there is eternal life to understand it is not worth taking revenge or steal or hurt others when we understand this fallen world is so temporary and this life is but a vapor.   When we are kind and generous to each other here on earth we bring more light of God here, and give each other hope.  As short as this life is here, we want to give each other encouragement and hope to be able to carry on and have a better day the next morning."

So I go to bed. Well the next day I can’t seem to just pick up where I left off, because my tools aren’t where I originally, and intentionally ordered them. 

On a few occasions, I’ve left the mess and attempted to work, but I never get much done when I do that. On the other hand, when I do clean it up, I start working and astound myself each time I complete another step in the building process, because I’m working at an astounding rate. What’s interesting is this; whenever you clean, nothing really changes because everything is still there, it’s just been moved slightly to the left or the right. It’s all still chaos, as it is all a random clump of atoms that just so happen to occupy a localized clump of space. The same tools are within reach, and sometimes even further away than when they were in the mess, but now you know where they are... now you know where within the chaos your needs lie."

believe in God. You refused to give an answer other than you don't
want to be pinned down because you don't like being pinned down. That
is certainly convenient. It means that you don't want others to find
inconsistencies in what you say. It means you don't want to have to
do the heavy lifting of people saying, “Hey, you said this and now
you say this. How do you square the two?” Then you launch into this
“logos” thing that is certainly not an idea that is ascribe to by
those who believe or don't believe. Maybe it's for those who want to
define God as the logic in the universe or the rules or the
principles. I certainly do not understand your thinking in that
respect.

But it is clear, you do not believe God
to be a person... but then in this series, you sort of hedge on that.
OK, fine. Let's hedge. But then you say this.

1:25:43 “If you're going to make the
case like God made at the beginning of the bible, that being is in
fact good.”

Oops! A case like “God made”? Not
even fundamentalist Christians are arguing that God made cases in the
bible. And the Jewish position is that Moses wrote the Pentatuch, not
God. Further, you even stated elsewhere, the bible is a group of
books.

So how is it that God goes from some
set of rules guiding the universe, some “logos”, to being
somebody that's doing even more in the bible than the fundamentalist
Christians are saying he's doing?

Further, if God is mean in the Old Testament as you say the universe really 
is (and I agree), how is it that New Testament writers (in a major departure from Judaism) demand 
us to look upon God as nothing but good? So what? You just accept
that? Where is your criticism of these clashes of the character of
God? Where is your criticism of the actual writers of this book?

UgwOLkB3BL69T2mR1MR4AaABAg,Lorin Hart,1526871648985,"Mr. Peterson, I am so enjoying and growing from listening to your lectures. I have a thought I would love to share with you and this is it : The biblical paradigm teaches that the world was made a full expression of God's nature, male and female, ( yin and yang ) and it was ALL GOOD. Then came the Fall, beginning in the spirit world, manifesting evil and infecting mankind, bringing us death.  Jesus is God's remedy for the restoring the universe to all good.   The pagan belief systems teach that evil is intrinsic to existence and therefore include it within  the yin yang dynamic, on the side of the female, of course.  I contend that the male/ female dychotomy etc is not originally a divide of Good and Evil at all, or Order and Chaos (but the known and the hidden perhaps). I would love to know what you thought of this if you gave it a moment...I believe it is more faithful to the biblical worldview and  makes a huge difference in how one sees the nature of life."

Perhaps it is these stories and other traditions that evolved beside our physical structure (body) and all elements of tradition that boxed us in, so to speak, that kept us safe and cooperative that allowed for the freedom from physicality, or rather abstraction to develop?

Peterson goes on to talk about focusing on microgoals such as tidy your room and then build on that each day solving bigger and bigger problems extrapolating yourself into the world but this says nothing about knowing yourself except that you may learn about that along the way but he doesn't even mention that and even then, you need to take time to reflect, observe yourself and consider a direction and some goals to that end. All I want to say is, you have to know yourself at least little bit first, know your weaknesses, your strengths, what you like doing and what you don't and from that, you can determine a direction in which to go.

Like everything, we are part of that beginning; I don’t believe we end in senselessness, as Darwin would have it, with what is human about us expunged into senselessness.  Explain the Cambrian Explosion, and don’t give me “punctuated equilibrium” or “directed panspermia”!

Nevertheless, I fear that this might cause rise to misinterpretation and a hard stance of ''checkmate, atheists'', which is clearly not the case, even though Dr. Peterson seems to be leaning quite strongly to the Divine side of things, so-to-speak; he does not do it with the malevolent intent of dissimulating any truths or manipulating others, but with the care of a deeply concerned person that wants us to see what he sees, and I agree with that in all regards. Speaking of regards, where are the atheists? -- I am curious because often in videos that contain anything that relates to Christianity in a positive light they will (or would in years past) swarm and completely destroy it, with that wit and elegance of a derailed freight train, ready to strike, not to make peace or come to an agreement.

Christianity says the prophesied messiah of Judaism came and therefore was fully revealed, and more than just a messiah, the surprise was that it was also God incarnate in human flesh out of love to relate completely to fallen man - in order to fully redeem man.  As he not only fulfilled the law perfectly (impossible for mortal man - just think about Adam), Yeshua (Jesus) also fulfilled the blood covenant to be able to completely forgive and redeem mankind. However, Yeshua said himself he will come again to continue his revelation (therefore fully has most definitely not yet been revealed).  He will next come again as a warrior and put an end to those who prefer their sin, pride, and individualsm over actively loving God and neighbour.

Then there are those thousands of circular patterns all over Africa. They are the product of some type of strong sounds that go into the earth and mine out rocks from out of the earth! All the shapes reflect those from sand-sound experiments. In Rome, we have all those columns too close together also (pointless buildings of they were to be used for rooms), and the right word ""amphitheatre"" was used to convey that they were used to resonate sound into a vibrational source of electricity. Then we have these drill bits with what are either copper wires tubes for sound to travel through and into the rock. Have you noticed the ""great buddha"" is often depicted with a head covering that looks like these cone rocks? Maybe he is the great Buddha because he invented this technology?

Being outside time after his resurrection, he entered and reentered creation in order to walk in the cool of the evening with Adam in intimate relationship. That's why Yeshua said ""before creation I Am"". He is the word and created all through his word.

Darwin made the same mistake btw - he couldn't see how this world can be called good.

But, in Biblical perspective, it is not today's world that is good. It was the world before the fall.

It's the occult/masonic view that makes the fall good and Lucifer good for opening the eyes of first humans. I believe it is not correct to interpret the fall as becoming conscious. If you read all the verses, it's clear Adam and Eve were very couscious already before. There was the law, temptation to break the law and breaking the law.

So, God said good about the creation before the fall when there was no death. After the fall the curse came and everything went downhill and this is what we see today.

The reason there are so many different interpretations of the Bible is because people are cherry-picking the verses."

Not long after, for logical reasons, I came to no longer believed in God. It was difficult at first, but soon after it was liberating. It was good to be free from the negative psychology that modern religion can induce. But I never could go completely anti-theist. Having been a very sincere and committed believer for most of my life, with wonderful meaningful experiences tied to that, I felt in my gut that it was ill advised to cast it all away. Now, I still don't believe in the literalistic notion of a singular, independent entity known as God out there somewhere. Most people make that God in their own image. But the idea of God as an abstraction of ultimate value, an ideal that we aspire to, a meta principle that underpins who we are as human beings, is immensely valuable if not essential. Sadly, religion for the vast majority of people is overly simplistic and unrefined in the extreme, to the point its dangerous. On the flip side, so too is the new atheist conception of religion. Peterson articulates what I've felt about the Bible and Christian doctrine, that there is incredibly deep psychological and societal truth revealed there by.

The process of ""development"" and ""creation"" is one of being organized and added upon under the ""mentoring"" process of a ""higher intelligence.""

(google Vivian Amberville - The Weaver of Odds by Louise Blackwick).

Vivian Amberville follows the story of an orphaned girl whose imagination holds the power to ""reshape the fabric of reality"". What's interesting about this story is that Vivian's ability to manifest (to Weave into the fabric of reality) is moulded very much by Chaos and Imagination, which make her a rather conflicted hero.

I think professor Jordan Peterson could draw numerous maps of meaning from this fantasy story."

So they identify Logos with God, and reinterpret Genesis as a giving psychic order to chaos. But the original documents aren't so centered on Platonic ideas like Logos. Scientific progress has given form to ""Logos"" in modern logic and computers.

The Son, in Christian theology, is not an ""active force"", it is the abstract soul embodied in the actions of the Christian community. The ""active force"" is the Holy Spirit. The idea that the Son is a force is coming from the grafting of Logos onto creation, and it's due to the origin of Jesus in Jewish mystical traditions, identifying Jesus as the agent of creation. The trinitarian view is that the Son is just emobodied the Christian community, it's like a mega-man made out of all the Christians in the world."

Not a necessity. Learning to play notes, sheet music, at your own speed can lift you straight into heaven. It requires a basic understanding of the instrument and music theory. But the things you speak of are well integrated in the a priori musical theoretic knowledge and the a posteriori unknown of persisting until music appears. The a posteriori does indeed open the doors of actualization, releasing potential, and it can be very profitable, spiritually, experientially, to experiment with setting in regards to where you place yourself in order to play. The process and discipline of sitting down to go over those notes again and again until they start sounding like music. Brand new music. Have no one judge your endeavor. It is very intimate.

Otherwise there wouldnt be bad in it.  My favorite response to that question related to free will, relationship with God, and the definition of bad.  God stating he made man in part to have a relationship with him.  What kind of relationship is it if one side has no free will?  Otherwise, that is slavery or automation.  God chose to create a world where mankind has the free will to choose or not choose Him.  If you follow God's will, that is the real definition of good.  If you choose not to follow His will, then by definition that is bad.  Assuming that God is truly perfect and all powerful, you must also then assume even if we do not like the consequences of bad in our world, it is a better world, or a richer world in the end, because we all get to make our own choices.

UgxqL3mrL-E0Tx7VCyR4AaABAg,Ray Moran,1519182070591,"Thanks Dr. Peterson for sharing these lectures and studies. I have learned from your depth of learning and skills to use psychology and philosophy to make ultimate sense;  deriving ultimate meaning out of human experience and from spirituality/religion, aiming at a universal body of belief or worldview. My only request or suggestion is to examine more of the solid interventions of God in human history (esp since the foundational religion of Judaism is structured on their very real historical encounters with the personable and living God). I can see how much of biblical stories do communicate using metaphors and figurative language but biblical theology does present revealed truth as objective truth and reality--I am referring to the Christian faith as presented in the New Testament. As you know Christianity is traditionally or historically understood and presented as embodied in theological absolutes and very real experiential realities that are associated or derived from entering into a relationship with God through the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, whether one consciously experiences such very real realities (spiritual realities that are experienced spiritually but which have their practical effect on the material plane with eternal significance in an ultimate way) or not, does not diminish their reality. Even faith in the Hebrew sense (not Greek) is an experiential thing and it is derived from God's Spirit. God is not viewed as an abstract representation of order or purpose (though he is the origin of both), but as a real transcendent personal being. I do see your insights as helpful in providing us with an awareness and a language to use for expressing a variety of paradoxical ideas or concepts. Having said this, I get much from your brilliant exposition and ability to extrapolate from what is not usually apparent in the biblical literature, bringing a cohesion to so many disparate epistemologies. Hopefully, your exposited thought will serve to spark the already present eternal voice of God who is calling all human beings made in his image to return to a genuine and committed relationship with him as Father through the unique Son of God, Jesus Christ. I really like how your meaningful studies rejects the flippant self-help movement to realize one's human potential and have a canned view of life. It is true we are all called to seek God with all abandon, seeking to embrace the only wise God who is always personable, loving, and omniscient."

UgwAWTkXXf88ucVc4ah4AaABAg,Romulo Ferreira,1519182072398,"When Jordan is talking about transcendence and hero mythology, I always think about the iconographic differences between Jesus the Christ and Shiva Nataraja (google it up and A/B them). One is nailed (passive posture) to a cross (suffering provoked by people) gaunt and dying a horrible death through the hands of his own countrymen while being mockingly entitled the king of jews (low social status) and the other is a virtuous and well-built dancing god-king (high social status) who dances competently (active posture) among the flames of chaos (chaotic suffering not necessarily provoked by people) while trampling the demon of self-ignorance. I mean, when you look at those two pictures the message about modes of being in order to achieve transcendence is pretty clear: you can either do it competently and artfully, or brutally and horribly, either way will get you through the door. Obviously the historical and mythological background behind those two myths is pretty different. One last thing that is interesting to notice is the fact that there is no ""trampling the demon of self-ignorance"" in the depiction of the western hero, it is as if the lack of that element implies a more materialistic approach to life, that's not to say that Jesus was a materialistic symbol, he wasn't, I think these representations (or lack thereof) are more telling of the collective western and eastern mentalities and approaches than of the gist of hero mythology."

UgyLsZ8AyYcEGGbEYJl4AaABAg,Luigi Paoli,1519182072415,"In the beginning of the Q&A, the raised catholic proposed that Lucifer, who is the embodiment of evil, was an outgrowth of God. But I don't think that evil was an outgrowth of God for God is all good and cannot be associated with evil. In the Doctrine of Sin and how it came to be, it was said that Sin came about from the rebellion of Lucifer. I forget where in Job or Isaiah it said that Lucifer was God's right-hand angel or one of the great angels who covered the throne of God. His name meant ""morning star"" in Hebrew. But let me get into what i am saying. God gave free will to humanity and to the angels. First, Lucifer took this idea of free will and corrupted it somehow and thought about it too much that the things he thought were very unorthodox and became the first origin of sin. Then he started to believe that to be all powerful and all loving, tyranny had to come about because he thought tyranny was the higher form of authority. So what I can say about tyranny is the coming about of corrupt free will that controls some sort of power. So he sought to over throw God and convinced some angels to believe him and take the throne from God. But God being all-powerful, quickly destroyed the rebellion and casted them into a void of darkness. Free will was meant to be good but susceptable to corruption. Sin is the corruption of something meant to be good. God is perfect and just but everything else cannot be like him therefore prone to corruption over time.This is what I thought about the catholic's statement but i could have taken his statement incorrectly and said something entirely different."
Ugyo0Ctx2cSrGEkNDbt4AaABAg,OnThisSideoftheSky,1519182072424,"Great talk. The answer to the first question is that Satan is not an outgrowth of God- but that in God's perfection he allows his creation the ability to choose between good and evil. ""Freewill"" as it is expressed in the bible is a function of goodness that allows for true love to exist. Love can't exist if its forced- love is by nature ""a choice to love."" Lucifer chose to rebel, but even the fact that Lucifer could choose as such is affirming of the goodness of God. All evil in the world is the result of a lack of Gods manifest presence- just like all darkness is a lack of light. You cant ""shine darkness"", darkness is a lack of light. Truthfully, the power of good and evil is not two opposing powers- Good is a power, evil is the lack of good power which becomes the manifestation of evil. Sin and desolation is the result of choice against God, which is the sin nature at the heart of every man and woman. Why free will?  Obviously God thought our choosing him through free will and making real this love between us was important enough to die on the cross- Christ is the atonement for our sins, so righteousness is all that through the Holy Spirit shines through us to reach God.

They were trying to cover their vulnerabilities what I find really interesting is when God finds them and after the initial confrontation and curse for disobedience God does something he makes them coverings from a or more slaughtered animals. It's like God said no to not being able to cover one self without blood being spilled. Like in the lecture about Cain and Abel. God was displeased with Cain's offering but Abel's offering was a blood sacrifice and Cain's was not. Maybe Cain made his brother the sacrifice I dunno it'd take more typing than I want to to flush the idea out on Ytube.

Ugx8mODuZiDWhswWmj54AaABAg,Ruben vd Broek,1516503672474,"Why people hate it that they're being said that ""everything they did was determined anyway"" is because they felt they put a lot of effort into it - and they did - because they were their determined body that was telling itself that it didn't want to do that. For that is what effort is, it is the complex system telling itself that something has to be very important if it wants to override the signs coming from the body. And when that happens - and it turns out well - the system is proud that it has done that, for it has done something very important, and, it has put a lot of effort into it. I.e. it has overcome its bodily restrictions, its signs telling itself not to do something. And the very act of thinking one has done something very important is the best feeling ever. So taking away that feeling by telling someone it was all deterministic, all determined, is denying the effort. It is denying that the person has overcome its bodily resistance - and, most importantly - it is also denying that anything is important at all. Because, for the same bodily resistance that is effort there is a bodily harmony that is willingness, harmony, value. To postulate determinism, therefore, is to deny any emotion and value, the things that seem the most real to us. The very things that make us us. We are our experience. And so we think that cannot be right. And in a certain sense it isn't, and in a certain sense it is. I think it's true that the world is deterministic, at least as far as I can see. But it is also true that we have have real emotion, real experience, real values. And somehow - I think that is the quest that awaits us now - we need to figure out how that is possible.We figured out how matter can create thought, through logic gates - i.e. computing. But how can matter create emotion? My best guess right now has something to do with embodied cognition and the self."

edit. Of course, Practicing Buddhism doesn't offer the kind of analysis that practicing Christianity (or Judaism) does. Buddhism is all about letting go of thoughts, and sensations, and continual inquiry. Of stopping wrestling with what, what if, how- all this continual questioning which just serve to muddy the waters in the mind. Doesn't allow it to settle. Buddha said the question of God or religion was not relevant to enlightenment. It only served to distance oneself. 

Interesting this hyper-western take on finding one's place in the world (the Occidental swamp) versus the letting go aspect of the Eastern practice of Buddhism."

UgxPEsC9nqUGALW34iJ4AaABAg,Tom,1516503677701,"PETERSON IS SAYING THAT GOD IS AN EVOLVED COMPONENT OF HUMAN NEUROLOGY?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Jordan Peterson is saying that God is a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Peterson is NOT repeating the old saying that God is just a ""figment of your imagination.""  Rather, he's saying that God is much more than a thought or a imagine in the human brain.  

Peterson is saying that God is NOT something learned from culture or constructed by culture or invented by humans (that's the claim of Marxists, Postmodernists, Atheists Activists).  

Rather, Peterson is saying that God is actually a component of human neurology.  

He's saying that God is in our DNA.  

To put this in terms of computers, Peterson is saying that God is NOT software that is added to some or many brains, but is actually built into the hardware of the brain.  

Thus, I think Peterson is saying that we humans have always told stories about God (as found in the Bible, and in other myths and legends) because the concept of God is hardwired into human brains.  

And Peterson believes that this God thing evolved in the human brain in order to enable humans to survive, prosper, reproduce, and have offspring who survive and reproduce.  

For this reason, Peterson believes that acknowledgment or appreciation of God, and obedience to the moral directives of God, are just important in the current time as they have ever been in the past.  And this is why Peterson is so opposed to people who strive to suppress God (i.e., the atheist activists).  

Peterson is saying that God exists; he is saying that God exists in our DNA and in our brain.  

Peterson does NOT teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  Peterson is well aware that some people still believe in this old-fashioned concept of God, and he isn't particularly interested in leading them out of that belief and into Peterson's biological, evolutionary, natural neurological God.  He believes the old-fashioned believers in the supernatural, Biblical God still get all the survival benefits from natural, neurological God.  

Some old-fashioned Christians say that God concept is in our DNA because God put Himself there.  But that's NOT what Peterson teaches.  Peterson says that natural biological evolution, NOT any supernatural deity, put the structural basis for the God concept in our DNA.  Peterson is a scientist, not a supernaturalist (Yes, some people are simultaneously a scientist and a supernaturalist--but Peterson is not that.)

I know Peterson does this with the concept of the ""true myth,"" which apparently he borrowed from Carl Jung.  Perhaps Peterson also borrows the ""power of myth"" concept from Joseph Campbell.  

I also know that Dr. Peterson adds little caveats, such as the doesn't know everything, and there could be realities pertaining to God that are unseen by him.  But in saying this, I think he merely saying what any scientist says regarding the subject matter he studies, which is that there is always more to know.  I don't think Peterson is saying that he thinks any of the miracles described in the Bible or in the Koran actually happened (e.g., Jesus raised from the dead; parting of the Red Sea; the flood sent by God that killed everything except Noah and the people and animals on his ship).  He doesn't flatly rule out that they could have literally bhappened; but his scientific training leads him to adopt a skeptical stance concerning the historicity of these alleged events. 

In sum, Jordan Peterson is saying that God exists as a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Peterson does NOT teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  

If I have misunderstood Peterson, please add a reply to correct me.  Thank you."

Genesis:
In the beginning God creates the heaven and the earth. And the earth is without form, and void; and darkness is upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moves upon the face of the waters.
(Close your eyes tightly and see the earth without form, and see the void as well as the darkness upon the face of the deep where the Spirit, Consciousness moves upon that face of your potential. Water takes the shape of whatever you pour it into.)
And God says, 'Let there be light': and there is light. And God sees the light and it is good: and God divides the light from the darkness. And calls the light day, and the darkness he calls night. And the evening and the morning is the first stage. 
(The light is consciousness divided from the dark, the unconscious. Instead of seeing the creation occurring by days, it makes much more sense to see it as creating in stages. For people who insist on taking Scripture too literally. They are metaphors, analogies, parables indicating the unfolding of the tremendous mystery, what the Alchemist call the Mysterium Tremendom. The Gold they were trying to make symbolizes the dormant soul, the spark of Divinity waiting to be ignited.)
And God says, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters'. And God makes the firmament, and divides the waters which are under the firmament from the waters which are above the firmament: and it is so. And God calls the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning is the second stage.
And God says, 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear': and it is so. And God calls the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters calls he Seas: and God sees that it is good. And God says, 'Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, after his kind': and God sees that it is good. And the evening and the morning were the third stage.
And God says, 'Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth': and it is so. And God makes two great lights; the greater light, (the Higher Mind), to rule the day, and the lesser light, (the human mind), to rule the night: he makes the stars also. And God sets them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God sees that it is good. And the evening and the morning is the fourth stage.
And God says, 'Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven'. And God creates great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters bring forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind': and God sees that it is good. And God blesses them, saying, 'Be fruitful, and multiple, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth'. And the evening and the morning is the fifth stage.
And God says, 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and the beast of the earth after his kind': and it is so. And God makes the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind': and God sees that it is good. And God says, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth'. So God creates man in his own image, in the image of God creates he him; male (yang) and female yin) creates he them. (We contain both the male and the female in ourselves) And God blesses them, and God says unto them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth'. And God says, 'Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I give every green herb for meat': and it is so.
And God sees every thing that he makes, and, behold, it is very good. And the evening and the morning is the sixth stage.

Also, you have to say that something is better than nothing in terms of being existent and nonexistent because no matter how much evil is in one's life a single act of good can make that existence worth living. That can only mean that something is good and therefore the alchemy of turning nothing to something or nonexistence into existence should only be viewed as Good. However, it is a similar ""Good"" to how the bible is ""true"".Good is relative to evil and truth is relative to false. What is good is true albeit not in the sense of statistics or anything physical but in the sense of the human psyche and consciousness (metaphysically). With all that being said, one can only try to turn those nothings of everyday life into somethings. Even if those somethings aren't the best they are and will forever be better than nothing."

Likewise, we cannot create true order out of chaos. Jesus said, ""apart from me you can do nothing"". This is not meant as a metaphor, it does not mean to find the Jesus within and cling to it.

FYI: The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) was not from Dawkins but was invented as part of a protest surrounding the Dover trial in 2005 where highschool biology textbooks had been replaced by creationist propaganda renamed ""Intelligent Design."" (I recommend the PBS documentary about the dover trial.)

The FSM was the creation of a new church (the pastafarians) just for purpose, and was a parody of many Biblical Literalist and young earth creationist arguments and materials. For example: denying gravity as ""just a theory"" and offering the alternative hypothesis that the FSM pushed us down with his noodley appendages, and that both theories of gravity and FSM should get equal class time and let students decide the truth for themselves. All of this mirrored the young earth creationist (oops, I mean young earth ""intelligent design"") talking points against evolution.

I REALLY like Peterson, but he often acts as if the overly simplistic understanding of the Bible and religion comes from Atheists, rather than face the fact that Atheists GOT those interpretations from especially aggressive and political but uneducated religious people themselves who were dominating much of the public discussions for decades.

I grew up in Church, and knowing primarily religious people, and the vast majority of them believed the world and often even the cosmos was 6000 years old, that every word of the Bible was literally true without contradiction, and that evolution was a conspiracy by evil people to deny God, be gay, and commit the Holocaust. Further the ONLY thing they knew of Petersons favorite Frederick Neitche (<=can NEVER remember how to spell his GD name on phone), was that he said ""God was dead"", which was not understood with any sophistication but simply demonized as blasphemy, essentially.

These extremely unsophisticated understandings seem(ed) to me the mainstream version of Christianity in the USA. They even have their own huge seminars and music festivals (Creation Fest for example). It's certainly these types of people who have been writing lies and slander about Richard Dawkins, his lifes work, and his entire field of study, and passing it off as legitimate science since before i was even born in the late 70s. If i was him, I'd be just as aggressively anti religion as he is. I've been given ""Christian Books"" and heard ""Christian experts"" on the radio who claimed to have read Dawkins and then just went on to lie about what his book(s) actually said and contained to push a superficial narrative for the untold millions who still think God created one man and one woman 6k years ago. This isn't strawmaning, it's what i was taught in multiple churches growing up and early adulthood and what my extended family and their networks believe(d).

I appreciate a great deal what Peterson is contributing to the discussion, but things like his lack of knowledge surrounding the FSM, as well as other comments that he makes, tells me he really doesn't understand the so called ""New Atheist Movement"", it's causes goals or purposes, or why it was so culturally relevant. Perhaps intelligent understanding of Religion was tied up in his corner of Canada where his Native Woodcarver friends mythology caused more reflection on cultural stories. Certainly a lot of this he's come to on his own. But he seems totally blind to the completely absurd versions of religion that constitute(d) the mainstream for decades. These absurd versions of religion were not invented by atheists. Rather the huge jump in atheism was people like me rejecting what i was shoveled at churches for 25 years, and people like Dawkins punching back to the fanfare of people like myself who were angered to discover that he had good reason to be angry and that evolution was a real thing.

If you live in America you can find multiple, likely dozens, of churches in your town or city that preach exactly the unsophisticated versions that Peterson constantly attributes to atheists. I will grant you that Dawkins and others could have done a better job, but even he had said repeatedly back then that the Bible was a cornerstone of western literature that contained useful beauty.

Because we recognize time and its passing we recognize what it feels to be loved because of how it's made us feel in the past but only because of reflection

Second, the author is all over the place. Doesn't seem to understand how to describe characters outside of their parents. Really poor illustrative writing on the author's part.

The characters are also one dementional, none of hundreds of characters outside of the main ones go through any meaningful development. It's seems the author read Game of Thrones and thought he could get by with filling his book with lots of sex, magic, mythical creatures, rape, and murder and ran with that without any characters devolving over the way.

But the main character, which has like 3-4 names, the main God guy has the most development in the story. He starts as a pretty childish guy and gets his act straight towards the end.

Individual sovereignty wasn't a dogma of any world religion until Christianity reached out beyond the Jews. Before Peter and Paul and John 3.16, the Jews' religion was explicitly ethnic-based, tracing all the way back to Abraham. And even then, individual sovereignty wasn't enshrined legally until the Bill of Rights outlawed the establishment of religion. Christians used politics to enforce their religious dogma for a long, long time. Every other religion from time immemorial, same thing.

On an evolutionary scale, it looks to me like individual sovereignty, at best, is a fertilized egg cell that just split in two. Maybe that’s why attempts to abort it are succeeding so well."

Experiments can be altered simply by measuring them. The experimenters own expectations can alter experimental outcomes. The laws of physics often don't seem to apply. As a way of explaining why things don't act the way they should at the subatomic level we got the many worlds theory & the concept of higher dimensions. Theory, I know, but if God exists outside of our concept of space-time then he would be unknowable. If humanity is made in the image of God then our own nature is unknowable from our 3 dimensional reality. The fall from grace would be a fall to this lower dimensional reality where we're living in multiple realities simultaneously without being aware of our other selves.
 
It could be said that evil is only necessary in order for humans to have free will. There has to be a choice. Evil itself would be more of a tool in this sense than a power."
UgynxoL_5kuXq3uK0jF4AaABAg,Isaiah Kelly,1505962904662,"1:59:42 The supposed contradiction of a ""Perfect God incapable of a perfect design"" is deeply flawed because it makes assumptions about what God is capable of and what actual perfection is. The presupposition here is that if God is so ""perfect"" than everything he makes should be ""perfect"" too. Why should that be the case and what exactly would a ""perfect"" design look like anyway? For me the issue here is not ""perfection"", but freewill. One fascinating idea in Christianity is that evil is seen as a consequence of freewill. Lucifer, Adam and Eve could not have disobeyed God without freewill, and this is what allowed all evil and suffering into the world. This idea can also be applied to the notion that ""hate speech"" is a consequence of free speech. So I think a better question would be - Is freewill the cause of all evil and why would God allow it?

""be advised.
God made thee perfect, not immutable;
And good he made thee, but to persevere
He left it in thy power; ordained thy will
By nature free, not over-ruled by fate
Inextricable, or strict necessity:
Our voluntary service he requires,
Not our necessitated; such with him
Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how
Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
Willing or no, who will but what they must
By destiny, and can no other choose?
Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand
In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
On other surety none: Freely we serve,
Because we freely love, as in our will
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell;""

UgyxmAQdWE63280X10t4AaABAg,Harald Thingelstad,1503284506827,"Coupling God with the Sun was also done during the early Middle Ages. Emperor Constantine, who brought Christianity officially into the Roman Empire was at the time a believer in the roman sun god Sol. He just needed something that could unite the splintering empire, and chose Christianity as an unifying force. The result was a mixed faith, where they asked which roman god they could couple this ""God"" with, and they chose Sol. The original believers, along with Jews, who held on to this being a complete falsification, were persecuted to the point of death if they wouldn't give up their old beliefs. And that, along with the rest of the Middle Ages, is why Jews are bitter towards christians to this day. Even when Christianity spent its first hundreds of years as a Jewish sect."
UgzcM6ZijtMa-lhlGZd4AaABAg,Harald Thingelstad,1503284506840,"On to the Bible and science again. There's no proof that the Bible writers saw the earth as flat. Some passages have in obscure ways been used to construct that thought during the Middle Ages, but there are other verses describing the earth as a ""drop"", for example, so there's actually clearer arguments in the Bible for seeing the earth as round. Anyway, these descriptions are always short and cryptic because it wasn't all that important to them. 
Using the word ""day"" in the creation stories is also an invention of translation. It can just as well be seen as a period, and it's quite interesting to see how these periods in the creation stories match up with phases in modern theory on how the universe was created. The universe was too dense for light to exist during the first few thousands of years after creation, for example. 
It's been described as ""if some person at that time, without scientific knowledge, were to see creation as it happened fast forward in a dream, that's how they would have described it."""

UgioqU45pPVtu3gCoAEC,Justin Deschamps,1503284513370,"TRUST IS VITALLY IMPORTANT -- Social capital, as defined by the legal system and law is the ability to call upon another, IN TRUST. What this means, although is hardly understood in our world, is that money is a manifestation of trust, but one founded on a lack of social trust. That is, when people can't form trust with respect to some goal or enterprise, then money is required to compel those persons into a trusting state. Thus, as social trust increases, which is predicated on the capacity to speak the truth and honor what is agreed, the need for money will decrease. Trust is vitally important to understand, and the postmodernists are hell bent on destroying trust, which needs to be balanced by more socially totalitarian systems to maintain society. 

So becoming more trustworthy, increases your social capital, which in turn allows your socially coherent desires to come to fruition. Trust is that hidden thing modern-man seems to have forgotten about, but which is so wonderfully explored in many works of fiction, like the Game of Thrones for example. Honor, duty, and trust worthiness are virtues that we as a people need to rediscover. But of course, if you believe there is no objective truth, if you're a postmodernist in your thinking, you lack the a priori biases that enable you to recognize the importance of truth and the trust that comes from it. Hence, postmodernism, or solipsism, is arguably anathema to society in general. Civilization is predicated on socially established truths, hence all legal and lawful systems HAVE TO account for objective truth, of which, the principles that govern truth come from a source... THE SOURCE—God."

Punishment for attempting to subvert God himself with the seed of His knowledge. The snake tempts man to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and in so doing gives him access to the Divine Knowledge. Like the snake had been cast from the heavens so to were humans cast from the garden. To cast away the fruit does not serve God, nor does attempting to depose Him. Had humans stayed in the Garden we would have no story to tell. 

Our duty is to maintain the balance of Good and Evil that resides within this conflict, and use it to create a society of which the Divine would be proud. In order to do this we must understand the source itself is not ours to control, it is a Divine Gift that can be taken away should we choose to abuse it. Which is where Free Will comes into play, man's greatest blessing and our greatest curse.

And Colossians also hints at this 'mystery' (as Catholics would say) of humanity continuing and furthering creation: in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church.

UggP2pNkxNcwoXgCoAEC,novusvoss,1503284524325,"I read in many comments of Peterson videos that people stopped being atheists, which I find odd.
It's not that I don't know what you guys mean, but you should stay aware that there's still a difference between looking at the bible as a metaphysical description of our underlying psychological structure and thinking that the world literally came to be in six days.
The professor might say he's not an atheist but he's not praying to god thinking there's an actual invisible all powerful being somewhere in the clouds that will take care of his business. He, as far as I can tell, looks at god as the ideal state of human consciousness, the abstract polar end of ideal human behavior. Most Christians on this planet don't abstract! And because there's something fundamentally wrong with taking religious beliefs literally atheism keeps gaining popularity all around the world.

Have you ever thought about why two religions go to war against each other? Think if Pepsi and Cola would murder each other for domination. They don't because (among other reasons) they know they're just selling beverages at the end of the day. Well the big bulk of religious people are not aware they're simply using abstractions to better understand reality. So as soon as you diss their fantasy to them it's not like they're being dissed for driving a BMW instead of Ferrari, to them it's like you want to shake the very foundations that make up their reality and replace it with chaos. Which is silly (but ofc understandable).

Ugj0F_8F4g2_e3gCoAEC,Ref Furry,1503284524343,"Sorry, Jordan.. this is just one topic you are wrong about. There is no proof of any god, let alone the Christian God, and morality comes from within yourself. I have listened to probably over 50 of your videos and heard you speak on religion quite a bit and you never once gave proof of God. Also, if you fail to see that we reason within ourselves to find out what is moral/immoral then you aren't as wise as you claim to be on this topic. How often do you pick up the bible to check to see if what you are about to do is moral? I would be willing to bet the answer is never. As a matter of fact, how often do you read the Bible and come across one of the many sections where it promotes violence, sacrifice, slavery, anti-homosexual behavior, and other horrendous acts, and then reason that out to be immoral and not something you should do today? I would assume all of the time if you actually read the bible. Also, don't even try to say ""that was in the old testament."" It clearly was, however, Jesus himself said in the New Testament ""For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."" As well as ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill."" So, no. Nothing was removed when Jesus came. Also, Jesus also wasn't this pacifistic guy as you like to try to say he is. He once said, ""And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me."" So he is all about slaying people who do not want him to rule over them to be. One more that I will bring up is when he said: ""And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death."" Those are in the New Testament, stated by Jesus and definitely doesn't sound anything like someone to worship. These are undeniably barbaric statements made by the person all of you Christians claim to be perfect, loving, holy etc. 

Your bible is not what makes you moral. Your own understanding that your actions have consequences, your ability to sympathize and empathize, and your ability to reason are what makes you moral. There is an aspect of social norms in there, but that plays a smaller role than the ones previously states. 

I have a challenge for you. Make a video give just one piece of evidence to prove there is a god. Then follow it up with another video showing how Christians have the correct God, and all of the other millions of gods are false. 

Until you prove God is real, do not claim one exists. 

One last thing, for those of you who will say idiotic things like ""prove god isn't real"" I would like to direct you back to preschool because that's not how the world works. You do not prove a negative. You prove a positive. It's why you aren't trying to prove why dragons or Santa isn't real. It is time you people start using your heads. This is the same exact thinking that the terrorists have. It is how they can read the Quran and say ""if god says it is good then it is good."" If they were worshiping the right god then what they are doing would be moral. There is nothing you can say against their beliefs besides that they were worshipping the wrong god. And yet you haven't proven that God is even real to begin to make that claim. Get out of your churches, put down your bible, and learn. You have been brainwashed your entire life to believe in this magic sky daddy that watches over everything and spend your entire life denying what is clearly wrote in the book he supposedly wrote and believing anyone who doesn't agree with you is going to burn forever. If that doesn't sound like a scare tactic and a giant scam to control the masses, I don't know what does.This isn't to say I won't listen to more of Jordan Peterson's materials because I find that he has every other aspect down perfectly. His wisdom in other areas is phenomenal and it just confuses me how someone can see so clearly in one department and then be completely blind in another. And with that, I end the post."

UgiEJdT-4pH1PngCoAEC,Alexander Pearson,1503284536773,"Just a side note. The flying spaghetti monster was created by a man in Nebraska who was angry at the state government wanting to allow the teaching of intelligent design in the science class room along with evolution. The argument was that since the theory of intelligent design  has been around for so long that it should be credible enough to be included into the biology courses. So what the man did was look up some old 14th or so century documents that had some vague discussion of something like spaghetti or something and argued that this thing should also be taught in class since it is old (and if you could get enough people to ""believe"" in it you have yourself the other half of the argument).  Sophisticated or not, that was what it was for and kind of a good example for what the atheism movement was kind of about, especially in america where half the country didnt believe in evolution.

 It may seem trivial now and indeed Dr. Peterson has done a great job at arguing for the greater importance for a grounded morality that your culture can provide, but it seems to me that your epistemological toolset and moral one feed off one another and are complements. As an example, Dr. Peterson says, there are an infinite ways that you can interpret a story or a book, but a very finite amount of them will actually help you out in surviving in reality. Figuring out that set to me needs careful observation AND a well structured value system. you need both. I feel like the atheism movement was more about how we should be careful in our observations and it had its place but it was never claiming to be the be all end all (IMO) and I feel helped  conservatives in america onto issues that were way more important (individual liberties etc) Anyway love the lectures :D"

UgjVo8b3I87gEngCoAEC,Albert Brennaman,1503284536807,"Here is what the humanities have lost in my opinion. They have lost their grounding in our western tradition's, which is partly DUE to our western tradition. The christian tradition put a lot of emphasis on guilt and shame but also celebrated heroism and sacrifice for others, which are some of the reason's why Nietzsche detested Christianity. However, what seems to have happened when we killed God, was that we kept the guilt and shame, whilst disregarding the heroism and self-sacrifice. 

One of my favorite games I like to play is; 'spot the argument' with people that put forth propositions. Trying to separate what the actual argument is in the mist of all the embellishing rhetoric's and appeals to emotion. Peterson himself, appeals to emotions as well, but the emotions he appeals to are valor/courage or duty/responsibility to only mention a few. However, whenever I here feminists talk, they appeal to (male) guilt by calling the advances that men made 'privileges', similarly a lot of people on the left when dismissing someones arguments as racists, sexist, homophobic etc. are all appeals to negative emotions. What I find, is that the emotions people appeal to are projections of their inner world on how they rationalize their behavior.

Now if Jordan Peterson is right that ideological frameworks are parasitic upon our underlying emotional associations we make when interacting with the world. Then this would explain the downfall of the humanities, because if your primary mode of being in the world is predicated by fear, anxiety, shame and guilt for example, you feel compelled to frameworks which minimize these within yourself. In a sense they become external emotional regulatory systems, that interpret the world for you. This is why I think peoples emotions run high when you criticize peoples ideological beliefs. However, the return must also be true then, in that based upon what type of belief system an individual has, it is a mark of their strength of character, or lack thereof.

Now the humanities used to be filled with great thinkers, however the drivel that comes out of the humanities today is an indication of what weak men (and women) would say. By lowering university enrollment standards, affirmative actions for women and minorities, these people didn't earn their place on the table of great western thinkers. However, now that they are within the universities, they have to justify their existence, and the only way that they can do this is by utilizing the same emotions that secured them these positions in the first place (shame and guilt)."

Ugj3eO3OSgQbzXgCoAEC,Jason Lock,1503284536864,"Buckle in, lots of thoughts.

I'm currently studying a Masters of Divinity after completing an undergraduate in Biblical studies. I wonder what JBP would consider about authorial intent. Because by abdicating authorial intent and by also neglecting a crucial verse in the creation narrative, I find JBP's interpretation lacking.

The Genesis author doesn't seem first concerned with anthropological purpose. JBP spent a could time deriving anthropological purpose from the Genesis 1:1-2 when man's work in the world isn't being referred to at all, rather God's work is being referenced. The author turns to anthropological purpose at the end of the first chapter when God offers humanity a command: ""be fruitful and multiple, fill the land and subdue it and have dominion over... everything on the earth"". (Genesis 1:28) 

There is are two crucial logical consequences that affect JBP's interpretation by choosing to impose anthropocentric reading and disregarding authorial intent.

First, humanity's role is exchanged with God's thus, veneration of God will be diregarded. The Genesis author suggests that God is the Creator who brings order out of chaos.  One logical consequence of the many logical consequences is that as a result of this exchange is that it disregards that Judiasm and Christianity's fundamental core: a religion that worship's it's Creator.

Second, humanity's role is exchanged with God's thus, humanity's purpose (from the perspective of authorial intent) is skewed. The Genesis author communicates from Genesis 1:28 that man's purpose is not creating order from chaos but cultivation of the order already created. That's a huge distinction and serves as the foundation for the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Will humanity be subject to their Creator cultivating and enjoying the goodness that existed apart from their effort. Or, will humanity step beyond their created identity and seek equality with God thereby corrupting their place in the goodness of God's created order.

Spoiler alert: they did not remain subject. That's the story of the Bible that follows from Genesis 1: God the Father restoring the corrupted world back to paradise through the Son Jesus made effective through God the Spirit. The 1st chapter of the Bible begins with paradise as a garden to be cultivated. The last chapter of the Bible ends in a city which has been cultivated by God himself in which paradise has been restored and corruption caused by humanity has been made inert through his Son Jesus."

Whilst as humans in the middle of all this, are social creatures, infatuated with the extremes of every corner of the universe and device, also need to perform vital functions in one scene and and dissipate the next. 
A religious scholar wrote ""God is that in which no greater thought can be achieved"", Duncan Trussel also had a good analogy on the JRE podcast that like you are just this void that is consuming and consuming and when you realize your own self and stop consuming you become the one that is consumed and that induces pain so you wreak havoc on the world that birthed you.... not even a good summarization but i'm not going to go back and watch it again, you should if you haven't."

It was conceived of not by Richard Dawkins, but by some guy in Kansas when their school board decided to allow teaching creationism in class, so as to ""teach the controversy"" between evolutionary theory and ""intelligent design theory"".  It was argued that the choice to allow equal time for one intelligent designer with no basis in evidence should justify the teaching of any other (why arbitrarily allow only a revised version of the Christian God to be taught as science, when there are others available?), and so the FSM was proposed as an equally valid alternative, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the proposition. I think any fan of evolutionary theory and/or secularism can get behind the FSM!"

If we see that we are a part of God, embedded within the Everything--the All--that is God; that there is a part of our being connected to the transcendent, it follows we are an imperfect, low-resolution version of God. From my language, you can tell I speak with the retrospective of having read Jung or the Kybalion. But before I read anything of a theological nature, indeed the reason I took an interest in the first place, is that I came to this conclusion through set theory, category theory and computer science. Not the only one either, others have followed a similar path. If a subsystem of a (computational) system is Turing complete so too is the Whole (and trivially so). The notion that if you know some aspect of your being or of a localized system, that you can prove that aspect holds also for the absolute.

UggkB3PQ_FYZangCoAEC,timothy ser,1503284547231,"Dr. Peterson, (PLEASE, PLEASE READ) I have read the preface to Maps of Meaning, and it seems to be profoundly descriptive of my experience. There was a time in my life when I argued, and talked to impress, and sacrificed my understanding of the truth to the pragmatic demands of an immediate conversation, where I stood to gain from the interaction. I can't do it anymore. Whenever I speak, a voice resounds through my skull, saying that I am a liar,  and a coward. My confidence has been shattered, Dr. Peterson, and it's like there are demons on my back 24/7. My dreams are elaborate, and metaphorical, catastrophes. There was a period about a year ago when I dreamt of nuclear war for three weeks straight, where I always flee into some strange landscape, without my family and the ones I love. They are all  terrible dramas of cowardice; I always run away from the threat, and into the night. A week ago, I had a dream where I had angered an intruding murderer by throwing some heavy object at him through the door. When I missed, I ran into my parents room where they and my brother were sleeping, and begged them to leave the through the window before the murderer comes (a strikingly common theme in my dreams). When they refused, I began to exit through the window, and before I could leave completely I saw my brother running down the stares to confront the threat with brazen courage. I began to weep like I've never wept before, and I heard the murderer yell up the stares, demanding that I not leave, or he will kill my brother. I did, but I was not as courageous as I should have been. My dreams have told me that I am a coward, which is how you described yourself in your preface. I have found that great thinkers are often quite difficult to relate to personally, at least through their work, but in your preface, and in you, I have found a reflection of myself. I am grateful for your work Dr. Peterson, as I am thankful for the music of Bach, or Shakespeare's plays."

12But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
13If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
14And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 
15More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 
16For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 
17And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.

UghxH2QempHj-3gCoAEC,Daedalus 29z,1503284559035,"Jordan, you dance around a particular concept regarding the purpose of existence, but you do not hit it squarely in the bullseye.  You talk about how a virtuous life is one that aspires to eradicate unnecessary suffering.  However, taken to its logical conclusion, what is the simplest way to eradicate suffering?  The simplest way is to eliminate life itself.  Without life, there is no suffering.  This is the same trap that 'virtuous' environmentalists tend to fall into, which you described.  So the elimination of unnecessary suffering can be a SECONDARY goal, but it cannot be the primary goal.  Additionally along these lines, as humans, we do not derive meaning and value from the elimination of one's own suffering.  You don't feel like your life is meaningful, for example, because you did not do heroin today.  Certainly, if one is struggling not to do heroin, it is a virtuous facet of one's being to overcome that- to NOT do heroin each and every day.  But it is not meaningful in and of itself.  So here's the realization that needs to be explicitly stated:  True meaning can only be derived from CREATION, not elimination.  Just as God is creating each aspect of the world in Genesis I and stating, ""it is good"", we, humans, create our meaning through our creations.  We create it through the relationships we build.  We create it through the good we do for each other.  We create it in the fruits of our labor, and the results of our responsibility that we act out in the world.  You had a line in this session where you stated something along the lines of, ""If only we could act in such a way, what magnificent cities we could create!""  And that is precisely the truth of our meaning.  A city is the lowest resolution accurate representation of human civilization.  The city-state, so to speak.  The city states of Ancient Greece and Medieval Italy gave rise to the Enlightenment and the modern world.  And we are extending/completing God's creation with everything we create in this world, and in the future, in this universe.  Therefore, I arrive upon the primary purpose of existence, the primary way to live virtuously, and that is to, ""Create the Good""."

Without a proper belief system society would degenerate into chaos, There's an important lesson that I believe previous generations have learnt and knew the importance of teaching such lessons to future generations thus the reason the texts were written by many people.

The texts are a footnote of what made successful civilisation's in they're time, I feel people take it too literally and because of that discard it as silly fairy tales that can't be implemented in reality or become so dogmatic about it they loose the ability to think critically and use it as they're ""god"" given right to judge others. 

Where really the reality of it is our society has been running on these traditions from the beginning of western civilisation and it has done great and amazing things, I'm not saying there is no god and I'm not saying there is.... But there is something about the universe that we don't understand and maybe that is what we label as God.

Well, my own blame will likely harm/limit me more than anyone else, so maybe this question isn't very meaningful. Better based on what? I agree with your conclusion that finding out what seems better is part of an ongoing process of making things better. What if we disagree on what is better and worse? I do think your points on collaboration, other things being equal, having higher utility than force is a good starting point, but the specifics will have to be part of becoming, not answered up front.

Seeing that becoming is a creative process and not something that can be understood or grasped ""up front"" is, I think, among the most key concepts. You touch upon this in various ways, but usually tangentially. It is a great point.

It's certainly true with the Greek gods and with how the titans defied them whose ash was turned into humans.

I also personally find that it, at least to me, makes the most sense to have the god of the old testament and to also have the logical conclusion be that one must 'kill god' in a sense which is to say create a place where the only god to be is man itself away from nature (the state of being merely an animal)."

UgiRh0JBlVW1W3gCoAEC,Philip Spires,1503284581391,"Question 1: Absolutely not. It seems the questioner assumes that perfection must lack tension, struggle, limitations, and be impregnable. As Peterson discussed, there are advantages to having limits, one being they give our lives meaning. You could say that if there was no struggle, ""perfection"" then would be problematic because life would be meaningless, there would be nothing to do, thus be imperfect.

The second problem with the question is that, by definition, perfection can only be one thing. Let's represent perfect with a number, 1. There are a lot of different numbers, there is only one 1. There's many similar numbers to 1 like 1.1, 1.0001, 2, 3, 111, etc but those numbers are not 1. If you place them in a problem, the solution will be different than if you use 1. Anything other than 1, no matter how similar is not 1; anything other than ""perfect"" is by definition not ""perfect"".

This means of course, God/perfect cannot create perfection because whatever God/perfect created would be different than God/perfect.

You can see this in the Genesis story, God calls all of creation ""good"", He doesn't call it ""God"". His creation is like Him, it has one of his qualities (good), but is different from God.

Since God's creation, by definition must be different from God it must have different characteristics from God. If God is omnipresent, omnipotent, all-knowing, immortal, etc then to have different characteristics may mean to be ignorant, mortal, etc- Lucifer.

It seems that in Abrahamic monotheism, anything without God/imperfect eventually diminishes and dies. It would seem that God can create what is ""good"" but being that ""good"" is necessary but not sufficient for ""perfect"", the creation degrades and dies. Satan then, is the degradation of ""good""."

They couldn't understand the concept, it was quite staggering in it 's own way to watch a supposed intellectually-centred individual refuse to grasp that energy, effort, resources, all of it is conserved on one level or another.

When I brought up the idea that people in their primitive state didn't spend resources they didn't have, conserving them, they claimed it was a form of environmental protectionism - liberalism.

The evolution argument - the same. Mutations aren't that many, but they claimed it led to a liberal idea of 'progressiveness'. When in fact it's literally absolutely neutral Darwinism that selects the success from mutations. 

Of course our ancestors had to be conservative, they literally had to conserve for harder times. When liberal, that is to say, charitable or welcoming of the new and unknown, it would only be possible in exchange, or expectation of benefit.
New tribes are resource competition, but merging is possible if there is a need for co operation on something. Our reality  only favours liberalism once we live in a time of plenty."

His book ""Reviving Old Scratch"" highlights his realization that the de-personification of evil and the death of the devil has inplications for the concept of God itself and even the goodness of existence and significance of willful action. He even identifies how the western liberal mind a society's beliefs in demonic forces is overly correlated with an unbalanced obsession with exorcism.

Time is a human perception, that measures ultimately the transition of energy that is stable and in a pattern and repeatable form, as another mean that is given unto our perceptions.

In Shakepeare, I think hits the notes perfectly in not understanding conscience but understanding, what it is to be, or not to be, which is a very basis of life, a temporal construct of the great dream within the universe. Who are we the nightmare or the love of life.

If I used conscience as  a modern example I would say there is a ladder of humanity in which is put forth in order and is often disturbed by the malice and hate of the world that begins chaos and disorder to the order of humanity, out of spite and jealousy, and thus darkness ensues when order is broken. The ladder represents us, humans, in our potential of conscience to others, the problem though is the order of our culture is destroyed and undermined by war cultures that have loved to destroy and teach the destruction and taking advantage of all people; which is kindness and love, to use these things to rob, steal and undermine the family and unit, because of some words written people learn and change their song, not questioning the reality of the song they choose to sing with. I am using song as a means of all words we drink from is of our spirit. It becomes out life if we allow it. What is the self, is to remove the songs in which poison life? To protect the songs of life beneficial. This thought pattern is in a good and evil context and its nonsense. SO we probably should stem away from conscience. in meaning. 

What is then law, is it a thorn in the garden that is beautiful and deadly in its inception, thus we use and force mental control over each other, and remove the ability of conscience of action of thought by law that guards our natural actions and money controls and takes our free actions when its not within freedom of its use. and if we study law, we can see how it has divided and destroyed life, rather than just basing people on their actions to grow it has caused much misery to many, because of the judgements done from its inception and to then the perversions of law, rather than its use."

Maybe in simpler times religion was important and significant. But don't forget that it was religion in the very first place which was established as total justification of human against human atrocities. Dogma started out as a very destructive and totalitarian thing. People throughout the ages have been murdered or maimed as common punishment in theocracies. It was only when blasphemy laws fell, that society started to become more moral and civilized. All religion does now is provide people with a sense of comfort and a crutch. I think people can have their religions if they want and I wont say anything or try to demystify them.

Catholicism is Satan worship. As is any ""Christian"" religion that pushes the Trinity. 
It's the ""mystery of iniquity"" the ""secret power of lawlessness"" 

Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God. Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness

According to the Hebrew, before the creation of anything, the Hebrew letters were created ""בראשית ברא אלהים את״"" the fourth word is ""et"" which is a nothing word which can mean ""the"". However scholars say that hidden in this word is the following: the word ""et"" begins with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and ends with the last letter.. So the letters are the actual building blocks of creation (mind blowing in my opinion). From these letters we can get an entire world of knowledge.. because their shape has meaning, their numerical value and each letter has an intrinsic meaning...for example the first letter of the entire bible is the second letter of the alphabet, it is a ""bet"" which means house and it is closed to all directions except the one open to us.. This shows that we cannot see past the moment of creation.. We live inside this house of creation and all before that is hidden to us. You would expect the bible to begin with an aleph. Aleph is the first letter and it represents G-d and is open to all sides..and it means the winner or alpha ..yet we cannot see this, because we are part of the world (in Hebrew world is - hidden)."

It is easily overlooked though when translating because  the word ""Adam"" means ""human"" and is used right from the creation. The only hint we get, that it isn't a name is that it is used with an article. So you'd read ""Ha'adam"" ""the human"". Right up to the point of Adam answering God's question, writing ""Adam"" instead of ""the human"" is an error in translation.
Also the word translated as ""rib"" means ""side"". God took one of the humans sides and created Eve from it. The other side is Adam.

UgiFBF6cL6CyDHgCoAEC,zac 48,1503284610196,"With the greatest respect, Dr. Peterson, I've been looking forward to this series for a while now, but this superficial, two and a half hour interpretation of the mystical Book of Genesis regarding the 'creation and the nature of reality', is disappointing and falls way short of the mark. It doesn't do the subject justice, at all, particularly considering entire libraries have been dedicated to the very same task. Analyzing the nature of the 'being that is human', in relation to the reality he finds himself in, is the topic of topics and subject of subjects and worthy of the most intense analysis and scrutiny. In Genesis, almost every verse and many individual 'words' alone, are deserving of as much time and consideration. So, please, take your time."
UgjCmCk4xLoFgHgCoAEC,ThePultzFamily,1503284610206,"It's obvious that Professor Petersons firm belief in evolution completely deprives him the option that biblical stories could be historical rather than symbolic. Peterson is now, through his rising popularity, on his way to start a new religion based on psychology. A Christianity without the historical jesus, where all narratives are symbolic. Peterson is starting a religion where the only real trustworthy history is the one told by mainstream science which is based in the philosophy of materialism. Peterson refuses to deal with the bible as history. He adheres to materialism when it comes to history, but wants to have spirituality too which results in massive selfreferential incoherrence. He wants materialism sprinkled with little nice chuncks of humanistic psychology on top, and he wants to use the bible and Jesus in this endeavaour. A bible and Jesus he just makes up on his own terms.

Peterson builds his expertise on mainstream sciences he has not ever evaluated objectively. He presupposes that mainstream big bang cosmology, mainstream geology with its uniformitarism, and evolution are facts, and he develops his philosophy from that point. Petersons rejection of the bible as a collection of historical narratives that has coherence from Genesis to Revelation, just makes him another guru in the endless row of new age apostles. Very compelling if you like Christian values but reject the historical Jesus, - very new agegy. Or maybe Peterson is a new L. Ron Hubbard, there's a disitinct likeness to scientology in the way Peterson tries to derrive spirituality from what he believes to be science.

I wonder if Peterson has ever heard of biblical scholars, -  it's obvious that he has never spoken to one. It seems like he has never ever investigated what Christianity is based on. It is based on belief in historical narratives. Peterson doessn't realize the epistomological proplems he faces , when he tries to do reasoning from a materialistic point of view. He thinks we came from monkeys, so he himself is just a beefed up ape, - why should I believe this ape instead of another.

So dear Proff. Peterson, you can't ignore that Christianity is built on the belief that the bible discribes historical events. You are creating the bible in your own image, which makes no sense at all. You want to derive spirituality from scientific materialism, - you can't. So how about consulting Christians to learn what Christianity is and why people believe in the bible, before you start scientotlogy 2.0."

UgjV_MRFw2RZ33gCoAEC,dvssk8er3,1503284610252,"Being raised by a single mother, it appears to me that I've clung to certain male intellectual figures that I regarded with high esteem and influence in my life.

In middle school through out high school, Joe Rogan was the first. This was around the time I began smoking pot and doing psychedelics.

Once I entered college, I gradually stopped using hallucinogenic substances because I desired to become a teacher. The bombardment of Marxist concepts and liberal professors left me conflicted in ways I could not articulate. Ben Shapiro became the next figure I looked up to as someone who had the ability to voice my dissent. Shapiro made me a conservative. I'm drawn towards those who go against the establishment, and I saw conservatism as the counter-culture.

Now, Dr. Peterson has become the latest figure I deeply admire. He has inspired me in ways I cannot yet express. He's exposed me to ideas that have moved me beyond belief. 

If by any slim chance you read this comment, Dr. Peterson, I'd like to say thank you. You're an extraordinary individual who has moved me beyond any one I've ever encountered. Thank you so much."

In my opinion, it is the narrow mindedness of man that made him deduce that G-d can only be good.. just as there are people who think that nature is only ""nice"". G-d is.. and even in the story of the burning bush.. G-d explains himself as: ""ehiyeh asher ehiyeh"" i.e I will be that I will be (not ""I am that I am"" - terrible translation). S G-d is all encompassing.. good and evil, all that is.. all that he chooses to be. How could it be otherwise? We are in His image.. and we are both good and evil. G-d shows us His benevolence.. but He can also be unscrupulous to those who trespass against Him... just like a mama bear can kill brutally in defence of her young. In Hebrew it is said ""there is nothing other than G-d"" .. which implies that G-d contains all reality.. which is a much more 3d version of G-d than saying that He's only this good and kind entity.. it also has a hidden aspect which is that all phenomenon are contained within Him."

I was consisting donating to it and saw that amount and decided a less well funded person who doesn't have a tenured position at a university (that probably adds upward of 6 figures but is paled in comparison to the patreon amount). I don't doubt that amount will shrivel in a year or 2 when the hype does down over the pronoun issue, but damn. I have to work for a year and a half, mostly overtime weeks, to reach his current monthly income (after patreon's cut) and my job is wearing down my body and stressing me out. I wish I could record some long winded lectures and range in the cash. Good fit you Jordan, but damn, I'll lose some respect if at least a quarter if that money doesn't go to charity. He could buy a house in Maine after 3 months work, about 24 lectures, 24-48 hours of actual work (not counting the years of learning he's done, just the actual product being produced). I expected around $2,000 but I was wrong as hell. He also averages about $10 a month per donor, that's nuts. Most patreon users get a whale or 2 and then a bunch of $1-$2 people, Jordan got game though."
