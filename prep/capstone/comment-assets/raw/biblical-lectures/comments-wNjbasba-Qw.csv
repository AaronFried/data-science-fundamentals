We listened together for about 15 minutes. He said,""See! What did he say?""
As I explained it, I realize he was not literate enough to understand the words, but he was intellectual enough to understand only if I interpreted the words into 4th grade language.
If you think Dr Petersen takes a long time to get points across, try using many words to explain each big word. Tedious doesn't say it all.

UgwydVnPyxKo6B8uq4R4AaABAg,Oscar Geronimo,1533610936534,"He starts to talk about The Flood after 1:44:00. But is all justified: this whole lecture is not intended to be simply a retelling of the story of the flood... it is actually an excuse or pivot to lay the grounds for an embodied theory (or reflection at least) of existence from the philosophical, evolutionary and psychological data and knowledge accumulated, and to use that to understand how ancient mythology reveal that, in this case applied to the myths of floods as representatives of the nature of how desastres in human life emerge by the nature of existence (all decays on it's own, entropy) and helped by corruption in ourselves and our society.
Some personal notes:
48:03
1:25:47 ""The chaos is hiding in what is irrelevant"".
1:26:56 When relationships fall.  ""There are certain things that you can encounter that can basically unglue you"".
1:29:31 [...] Your performance...
""....You don't know: it's all of those things at once. Ans that's very stressful because all of those things at one is too many things. And that's the re-emergence of chaos. That's the flood. That's the return to the beginning of the cosmos. That's another way that it's been represented mythologically is: you voyage all the way back to the beginning of the cosmos when there's nothing but undifferentiated chaos. And THAT'S what you're confronting. And maybe it's too much for you and often it is, I mean, that can be TRAUMATIZING, it can HURT your brain, it's just too much for you to bare. it doesn't matter, you're stuck with it...""

It's a total non sequitur. Some just aren't interested in that institution or idea. One could argue that true love would be not to burden one another with a contractual restraint that basically says ""I don't really trust you to stay with me otherwise and this document says that you must."" Giving someone complete freedom to leave if they wish and to desire happiness for them without conditions of remaining with you, that's actual love, as well as respect of their sovereignty and human dignity. People forget that marriage was created minus the notion of romance, but rather was for practical purposes. It actually has very little to nothing to do with love."

UgxhXHMfc_uK7Imorh14AaABAg,Tyler Scarborough,1532142140374,"Every story fits into Dr. Peterson's paradigm ultimately, because his thesis is that we are all built into the archetypal ""story."" So, while Peterson's (brilliant) ideas can be made to fit into the story of the ark, the story itself does not necessarily imply his ideas. It seems to me that Peterson reads his analysis into the story rather than letting the story say what it itself intends to say. For instance, from the Bible's point of view, the ark story is about how evil the world had become, and so God regrets making them. It does not seem that the reason for God's actions is the people's unpreparedness, while that would obviously be a useful didactic reading of it for the purpose of learning from past mistakes."

At that age my grandmother owned a 3 family house. She lived on the first floor and me and my mom on the second floor and neighbor on 3rd. But from time to time I would stay with my grandma and she would open up a lil foldable bed and I would sleep in her room.  And she had the basement and there were 3 rooms in the basement that were rented out to people.. and I had a dream where I would go to the basement very consciously and I would open a door and the walls would have water on them like if it had just flooded and the water just receded.

At the cross, Jesus took all the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, that was contrary to us,  blotted it out, erased it, and nailed it to the cross,  and pillaged principalities, and powers and brought them to an open shame.  Satan was defeated at the cross.  Death and hell were defeated at the cross.  Jesus has the keys to death and hell.  We have been reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.  God in the riches of mercy, and his great love in which he loved us, even while we were dead in our sins, quicked us together in Christ, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

Like, maybe these are the words that they used to differentiate people who were creating language, creating the Word in reality, from those who were just regular humans who could take what others create and use them. 

The thing about language is that there's two sides, speaking the words and understanding the words. And some people are better speakers, and some are better listeners. Maybe at one time, it was all Sons that were good speakers, and all Daughters that were good at understanding.

But what if the flood hasn't happened yet? In Blade Runner they made Rachel more balanced and easier to control by givng her her creator's niece's memories.

If these drugs can solve the intricate and complex problems of relationship, then there is nothing more to be said, for then relationship, the demand for truth, the ending of sorrow, are all a very superficial affair to be resolved by taking a pinch of the new golden drug. Surely this is a false approach, isn't it? It is said that these drugs give an experience approximating to reality therefore they give hope and encouragement. But the shadow is not the real; the symbol is never the fact. As is observed throughout the world, the symbol is worshipped and not the truth. So isn't it a phony assertion to say that the result of these drugs is near the truth? No dynamic golden pill is ever going to solve our human problems. They can be solved only by bringing about a radical revolution in the mind and the heart of man. This demands hard, constant work, seeing and listening, and thus being highly sensitive. The highest form of sensitivity is the highest intelligence, and no drug ever invented by man will give this intelligence."" – Krishnamurti"

Ugw4Y-nh0qMhdZ4_0FR4AaABAg,Christopher Rivera,1521601359280,"Alex Kierkegaard: 835. The centralization of wealth is a natural consequence of the progress of culture. In the past, someone would invent something, say a new song. Then the bards would learn it and fan out and perform it, so lots of people would be involved in that process and profit from it in some way. Now the creator transmits his creation more or less directly (to the entire species no less!), cutting out the middlemen, and leading to huge profits for himself, but zero for the middlemen. Fewer and fewer middlemen as we progress, because we are interested in, and want to reward, the ends, not the means. The elimination of the means is even one of our goals! That's how you improve efficiency lol! It would make no sense for us to try to find ways to multiply the middlemen! Like actors who will also lose their work eventually to digital replacements, because we are interested in the finished movie, not the acting, etc. It is a colossal waste of effort to try to oppose this process, as opposed to welcoming it, harnessing it, and riding to the top of it like a cybernetically enhanced techno-God climbing to his rightful place at the top of the culture complex as in some grim dystopian sci-fi novel which I have already explained that, to US, it is in fact utopian 'cause we love that shit and live and breathe for it. In the long run, then, EVERYONE will lose their ""work"", because the purpose of progress is not ""work"" but ""war"", and co-operation of any kind (i.e. civilization) is merely a temporary means to that great all-consuming war at the end of which, as I have already said, there can be only one.

617. The solution may indeed sometimes be in the middle of the two opposing viewpoints, but the truth will never be. For the truth is no solution, but a problem — which is to say a goal, a challenge, that doesn't ""solve"" anything but merely creates even more problems which keep the ball rolling and the game evolving — otherwise there wouldn't be any flux.

602. Ascending individuals have ""goals""; ""problems"" are for descending ones. It's the same basic concept — the tackling of a challenge — but viewed from antithetical viewpoints, the vital difference between them being that goals are set by the individual, whereas problems by his environment. The location of the initiating force tells the whole story, if the terminology employed to describe it didn't do so already (which of course, to anyone who knows how to interpret it correctly, it always does).

769. The Rise of Homo Abortus. The typical family in the past had half a dozen children, most of whom died young. But modern medicine conserves everyone, thus it floods society with mobs of weaklings who wouldn't have made their first birthday in previous times. Physically inferior because they only exist due to science's help, mentally inferior because of a safe, coddled lifestyle, and there you have the vast amount of decadent organic matter that generates and perpetuates modern decadent ideologies.

367. Increasingly older people making babies. Result: weaker and stupider children. Death of the family. Result: disadvantaged weaker and stupider children with psychological issues. Society inundated with decadent propaganda. Result: disadvantaged weaker and stupider children with psychological issues pissing their lives away doing stupid shit, and therefore ever more resentful towards the increasingly tiny minority that somehow manages to avoid all these pitfalls. — This is the face of the subhumanity of the future: weaker, stupider, and more resentful than ever before. They will make Neanderthals look like geniuses and supermen in comparison. But, for the same reason, they will cause the Overmen of the future to shine more brightly than anyone has ever done before.

770. The very purpose of technology is to create ""unemployment"" — i.e. to free people from the lower occupations in order to enable them to engage in precisely the higher ones, but it's not technology's fault that most people are incapable of any higher activity than brute manual labor — it is society's fault, for not adopting comprehensive eugenics programs that would have weeded out for good such useless losers from our gene pool. So what do we do now that demographers are telling us that it is precisely those low-IQ brutes that are exploding in numbers due to the infinite food supply and advanced medical care that our technological prowess has thoughtlessly lavished on them and that they'll demographically dominate the future? There's only one solution. We exterminate them. And it's precisely to my aforementioned Overman nation that this unsavory task will fall. But I hope the artists will help us make it savory. I even intend to kick off this artistic beautification and glorification endeavor myself if I find the time."

That's why some people, mostly those familiar with the stories, but without having studied the material in any depth, claim that the ""God of the Old Testament"" was cruel and vindictive. It's the same God in both books, but the flood and the command to wipe out of every man, woman, child, and animal from certain tribes, in the Old Testament, were attempts to correct a problem in the gene pool.

There exist two somewhat incomplete points in Biblical Series part VI. At about 1:08 and at 1:45 respectively. ""To sin against the Holy Ghost is the one sin that can't be forgiven. What ever that means ... You've blown apart the relationship with the thing that fixes it."" This is true but fails to exhaust the intent of the passage. From the 1537 Matthews Bible, Matthew XII : C ...""Either, How can a man enter into a strong mans house / & violently take away his goodes: except he first bind the strong man / and then spoil his house? He that is not with me / is against me. And he that gathers not with me / scatters abroad. Wherefore I say unto you / all manner of sin & blasphemy shalbe forgiven unto men: but that blasphemy of the spirit / shall not be forgiven unto men..."" Imagine you saw public posters advertising a mens club but thought them a hoax for sport. You have then rejected the possibility of it being real. You would not investigate its existance and would then not find it. There becomes nothing the members of that club can do to invite you further. The chances of you joining become very slim. So it is with free will, true love and the promises of God. Blasphemy is the denial of the existance of the Holy Ghost ( and thereby God Himself ) despite any evidence. Unforgivable because the person rejects Him and not that He rejects the person. At about 1:45 it was stated, in reference to Genesis VI ""...for that he is also flesh,..."" making a diferentiation between God and us. Possibly justifying the action next taken. This is a very modern translation which alters context. ( again from the Matthews) VI : A ""And the Lord said : My spirit shall not all waye strive with man / for they are of flesh. Nevertheless I will give them yet space an C & XX years."" To be ""of flesh"" is to be of the fleshly realm, or to be worldly, apposed to spiritual. This is unavoidable with technological advancements and materialism as we gradually transfer our faith. Of course God still consistantly tries to guide us and has not abandoned us.

He says ""if the world is taking too much from you, you start to get resentful"".

This does provide some justification for SJW's but in doing so it criticizes their existence. They give an existential threat to the order. There must be something else. 

Think about how profound that is. What a framework for interpreting reality. 

""if you CAN convince people to be resentful of reality, how do we remove tyranny without disrupting order WHILE protecting free speech?""

OR 

""How to solve the problem of resentfulness, what structure must be put in place that resentments can be properly dealt with so that people do not sacrifice truth and order in their virtuous path against Tyranny""

From my perspective, there is no sure answer. 

But we need to provide a method of analysis that runs counter to 'critical theory' or its ilk. It needs to be taught alongside critical theory. The dangers of critical theory unhinged need to be made common knowledge and believed. And the problem of 'too much faith in patriarchal order' importantly considered in relation. 

And BOTH need to be integrated in these 'social justice' courses (that are sorely lacking in Yang in every way). Justice requires it to be critical of itself and the world, but also far more trusting as a basis upon which to form the criticisms. The purpose of the criticisms is not ever to bring down the system. Because that is our death. But to get the system to have a better mechanism of self correction. 

Part of this is properly defining the scope of personal responsibility, and the balancing realities of our nature. The kind that if we misinterpret that send us wildly off course in our phenomenological reality.

So far the only path i can see is truly by making the kind of understanding of Peterson common place. So common that just as people now consider things in relationship to justice for 'all' or their impression in relation to post modern interests. They need to consider things also in relation to the beauty, importance and true meaning and value of the current 'patriarchy'."

and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”

7 Signs from the Universe that Confirm You're in Alignment
When you're following your intuition only acting on what feels truly aligned in your business and in your life, you inevitably start receiving signs and nods from the Universe confirming you're on the right track. 

It can be incredibly supportive when you learn to recognize these signs rather than dismissing them as pure coincidence.

It all fits...

(44) Jesus said, ""Whoever blasphemes against the father will be forgiven, and whoever blasphemes against the son will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either on earth or in heaven."""
UgwMvahSqMdC2nigEsZ4AaABAg,Drew Boothe,1511233372616,"Dr. Peterson, you mentioned that you didn't quite understand the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, and what that was all about, and I've read something a little more detailed in the Gnostic texts:

http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html

Katrina was a disaster because corruption and inattention to civil society created conditions that ensured that the storm would wreak the city. We create the conditions that invite disaster.

People in ancient times could see that their suffering was related to the fact that they were not living in the right way and God was inflicting His punishment.

We are neglecting basic moral precepts and through that neglect are inviting collapse of civilization. Political philosophers say share natural wealth. We can look back hundreds of years and find this message repeats. But we do not listen. We do not require that industries pay money to the people when they put pollution or deplete resources. So harmful practices remain profitable to industry. We cannot expect a good outcome when we allow harmful practices to be profitable.

 They found in Professor what they were looking for in those drugs, especially psychedelics that's why they don't ask about cocaine or heroin even though professor talks about it far more than psychedelics. I say all of this with such confidence because I am one of those guys.

I don't often remember dreams but this one in particular has stuck with me. For some background I had been going to this church for my whole life. Even went to school there for a bit. So I was there 6 days a week at a point. Know it all over like the back of my hand. It was like a second home for that time it felt. In the back of the church is a hallway with some offices and bathrooms. In my dream I had discovered this room in between the men's and women's bathrooms. Just showed up out of nowhere. I opened it and inside it looked like the men's bathroom but no toilets, sink, etc. It had the same tiles and overall room structure. The walls were overgrown with vines and ivy. In the middle of the room was a square bottomless pit. The tiles were going down the inside for as far as you could see down it. I remember there were at least two other people with me. I can't remember if I saw them on the inside of this room or if they were standing in the doorway with me. But I wasn't alone. I remember feeling intrigued and excited about discovering it. No sense of fear or anything. But I'm not sure if there's a spiritual/religious significance to it. I often see people dream about discovering new rooms in their house, not a church. And why a bottomless pit? Was it used for something? Am I meant to use it? Am I meant to merely avoid it? Why was the room abandoned in the first place? When you brought up the concept it popped into my mind again. Now I can't stop thinking about it. These lectures have really opened up my understanding of the Bible. Could it have been a prophetic dream that I just now got the key to understanding? Perhaps the room represents my newfound understanding through these lectures? Pretty crazy to think that a dream I had that long ago would manifest into something like that at this time. But still... why the bottomless pit?"

I came back in at about 1:27:00. He started talking about your boss calling you in and saying that you're performance is somewhere between mediocre and decent, and we're downsizing, so see you later. And then about how to make habitable order out of that emergent chaos. (I'm paraphrasing at this point). Then goes on to say about why that may have happened in the first place, and I swear down he pretty much hit the nail on the head about why I feel like I'm in this situation. 

I lost my job (more than once), I realise it's probably because I feel bitter and resentful at the fact I didn't do what I really wanted to do with my life, which severely impacted my mental health and performance at work. I never stood up for myself at any point and just went with whatever came my way. 

I wish Dr Peterson had started to gain a name for himself on the internet earlier, I might have convinced myself to do more with my life sooner.

Ugh5wSROCLpycngCoAEC,GEORGE DEUR,1503284599651,"Hey Dr. Peterson, I enjoyed yet another great insightful lecture from you; thank you so much for your efforts and hard work.

I just had a comment about one thing you commented on in passing, particularly about ""blaspheming against the Holy Ghost.""  You commented briefly something to the effect of ""who knows what that means?""  Forgive me if you already have heard this or if someone has already commented on this below (I haven't read through all the comments yet), but if I may, I would like to share a rather traditional Protestant Christian interpretation of what Jesus means when he warns the disciples about this after the Scribes and the Pharisees publicly accuse him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebub/Satan  (Mark 3:28-29; cf Luke 12:10; Matt. 12:31).

Essentially, as I understand it, Jesus is warning the disciples (and possibly also the Scribes and Pharisees in Mark 3) that if you attribute the works/miracles that are brought about by the power of God via the Holy Spirit (as in the ones Jesus was doing right at that particular moment in the passage) to the devil, then you will never be forgiven for that sin BECAUSE there is no way to forgive you because you will not realize that you have sinned by attributing ultimate benevolence to ultimate malevolence.  If you believe that Jesus drives out demons by the prince of demons, then you will most likely never ask for Jesus' forgiveness because you will simply assume that Jesus cannot forgive because He Himself is committing evil by an evil power (even though it looks good and has good results for all involved... except the Pharisees, I guess...)

So, to parse it out in more psychological terms: if you are always attributing ultimate benevolence to some kind of trick of ultimate malevolence, then you will never be able to properly sort out what is actually true and you'll always be ""flying upside down"".  And as long as you persist in this misperception, you will never be ""forgiven""--meaning you'll never be able to correct yourself, not because people won't correct you or don't think you deserve to be corrected or helped, but because you will never see the problem clearly enough as it really is nor will you actually see the solution (because you'll mistake it for another manifestation of the problem.)  Don't intentionally attribute the work of the Logos as actually being that of Chaos; if you do, you're doomed.

Anyway, just my two cents.  Please forgive if this is already old hat.  Thanks again for the great lecture!"

Regarding all of the information given in these lectures and Jordan Peterson's rising fame, what's happening here is that Peterson represents to a large extent the highest degree of order of being which we all are part of. Let's face it, we are here from all colors, race, religions and ideologies (right wing and left wing). And yet here we are, listening to this man spout truths which make us take a massive introspection in which we discover that we are indeed inside the dragon's belly, namely, chaos.
But, there's more to it. Not only are his words helping us discover our dragons and consequently other's dragons, Peterson is that hero which descends from the clouds of chaos to bestow upon us the swords of truth to slay them.

This is why I think there's a vast amount, in my estimation, of people that admire him. When was the last time someone said: ""Go clean your room!"" and it instantly became a habit? 

I think I speak for most here. So, Dr. Peterson, we deeply admire you! Slay the dragon!"
UggZSWUwK4pQ23gCoAEC,Jesus Jehovah,1503284608594,"Mormons teach there god was a fallen, exalted, saved, finite man like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob -------

""The Gods who dwell in the Heaven...have been redeemed from the grave in a world which existed before the foundations of this earth were laid. They and the Heavenly body which they now inhabit were once in a fallen state....they were exalted also, from fallen men to Celestial Gods to inhabit their Heaven forever and ever."" (Apostle Orson Pratt in The Seer, page 23)


 Would you think fallen means sinner In the 1844 LDS publication, Times and Seasons, volume 5, pages 613-614,... Joseph Smith reiterated that God was an exalted man and that Mormon men could also become Gods. This teaching is well documented, as is their claim that God is not a spirit being, but that he has a body of flesh and bone.


 “God is a perfected, saved soul enjoying eternal life.” (Second Counselor in the First Presidency, Marion G. Romney, as per Salt Lake Tribune, April 3, 1977.) It appears ridiculous to the world, under their darkened and erroneous traditions, that God has once been a finite being; and yet we are not in such close communion with him as many have supposed. He has passed on, and is exalted far beyond what we can now comprehend. Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, vol. 7, p. 334 


Doctrine and Covenant’s  132:
20: 20 Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.


37 Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods."

To me it seems like a man walking the plank with the female on the safe side (with the instrument to push you on her hand) and underneath is hell. It is disturbing to me that men are expected to get on that plank voluntarily and potentially be the authors of their own demise because the eye on top of the pyramid saw it but to the woman, it was you who got there by yourself, it wasn't societal pressure or her expectations pushing you. What is even more interesting to me is that marriage is such a worthwhile proposition for women that even atheistic women tend to get married, even though it has religious origins. So yeah, that is the way I see it. I think in an epoch where consent and choice seem to be front and center in discussions of identity and sexuality, it might be worth while to ask ourselves is marriage is really something men choose or are pushed by societal pressure to do? Can women sacrifice marriage for the sake of men or should men continue to sacrifice themselves in marriage for the sake of women?"

I've been following Biblical Series with a great deal of interest. It's a testament to your erudition, eloquence, and dead-level reasoning that you give this atheist serious pause to think, and I'm only one of a great many.

However, I notice that you spend more time talking about tangential topics rather than addressing the Bible and its stories themselves. To some extent, this is understandable: The incredibly dense stories can be unpacked in so many ways, and you bring to bear on them insight from the fields of psychology, mythology and politics, among others. But in doing so, you repeat much of what you've already said, both in other courses and in other lectures of the Biblical Series itself. For example, I'm an hour into #6 and there's been hardly a word spent on the actual flood story/stories. 

I think it would be a better use of the audience's time and attention if you kept digressions on a more need-to-know basis (i.e. when they have a direct conceptual bearing on the story at hand). You surely must have a lot to say on the verses beyond the first lines of Genesis. With brevity in mind, who knows? We might even get to the end of Genesis!"

The anti-white propaganda which has been pumped out by media and academia for going on 100 years is the most obvious and effective psychological operation in history and needs to be addressed by people who claim to be cultural critics. When white children are singled out and taught to hate themselves for things like slavery and conquest which all races are guilty of, when white countries are actually being sued for not letting genocidal levels of non-whites pour in, when white people are denied self-determination and are even imprisoned for resisting their own genocide, we have an obvious targeting of a race for destruction and this needs to be addressed."

For instance, telling a female that they will be raped at every corner, regardless if its true or not. Will have a significant impact on that society. i.e. societal chaos. For before hand the female never thought of this, naive, to the underpinning of goodness. Just asa male in the same circumstance of words. This is the power of the words, is giving or creating ideals or theories never congruent to the mind. SO contaminating or removing the innocence of the mind in ways to act un accordingly, by prognosis to fear. Thus, a malformation as disease exists.

Now, if a sect or someone that perpetrates these words and you battle against the rhetoric or lies or nonsense, and are demonized and hated.. you hated not first but hated for your truth, as the words have become the belief in which they want.

Then we have a massive theft of over several thousand years, trillions upon trillions of assets out of the house of knowledge the house of rebellion, in which does as it pleases on the earth, without law or regard, as long as it can feed itself, thus steals the brilliance of others. Ie, ferrilli, Taghauer. Many companies in which have committed acts against others, by war and or lies. Thus quickly build the world using money as a portion of the ruin they cause. So its a endless snake eating nonsense, in which the world exists in chaos, because order is not in place or stability. Since logic is removed to the pursuits of people .

The land I live in is a shit hole. there are many other pa lies worth while working, such as in the south, Italy and manny others, or navy, since in this land I live in, removes the structure of society, by claiming victim because they are told they are a victim, and thus the words... are the ends. to meet the means, in which destroys the very society. It's a really strange world.All things of this world are of the world... People ignore all the mannerism of present war of the world... and the lies in which the world exists. Yet, th thieves and or liars take what they can use to mislead and then steal the public purse, its al la mess..."

But the real meaning of the Flood stories, as Utnapishtim could have told Gilgamesh, is that there isn't a way out. The task of philosophical psychology is not to solve a problem which isn't solvable in the long run, but to come to peace with its existence. 

Without the secret of immortality, and losing even the gift to be made young again, Gilgamesh must return to ordinary life, to enjoy celebrations every day of his life, attend to his practical concerns, cherish the little ones who hold his hand, and make happy the spouse in his arms.

UggUY2_oUqJOlHgCoAEC,Russell C,1503284639846,"Dr Peterson (circa. 5:15) - re: ""Hemispheric specialization"" etc. 

I realise this is the conventional orthodox model and language description but given your emphasis on the 'truth/facts' it might help in some cases to reframe the descriptions of the brain around the biological evidence. The biological body is based on the dividing of cells and there is an isomorphic mapping across the vertical midpoint line. We have two eyes; ears; hands; legs; ... etc. Not two half-eyes; 1/2-ears etc. In fact I'm advised by medical people to whom I put this point that there is even such a line running through the heart (or 2 conjoined hearts). 

In 'reality' (i.e. truth/fact) we have two brains crammed into one head space normally conjoined by a hyper-link called the corpus callosum. I would suggest that this arrangement is augmented by a '3rd' brain complex associated with the gut and the vagus nerves (x2). 

This degree of specificity in language/definition is not material for general run of the mill medicine - as complex math is not necessary to buy and sell apples. However, it becomes more meaningful when a complex systems perspective is adopted in areas of research into systemic disequilibrium such as autism and perhaps even some forms of mental health triggered by stress.

The PC notebook I am typing this on has 8 central processors coupled in a homeostatic arrangement to produce a viable (mostly) working system known as (identity) ""Windows"". We can also note the similarity between the three-brain model of the biological body (2-head + 1 gut) and the trinitarian model applied in some religions -- e.g., Christianity and Hinduism.

My interest (and implied question) relates to how (if any) a more accurate grounding/mapping of the theoretical mind-brain model and language onto the actual biological evidence would facilitate new thinking and insights into complexity and inhibited harmonious development?

There seems at brief glance to be very little research literature on this area -- apart from, perhaps, ""split brain"" topics. 

Do you have any thoughts on this area and/or suggestions on how to progress research etc? 

As a side-note: I'd suggest the perhaps the archetypal struggle between 'brothers' (Cain and Able) can perhaps be also understood as part of this emerging 'single' identity (in most cases) from two head-brain systems. The 'problem' I have with the dominant hemisphere model is that it assumes, a priori, a very 19th century 'flat earth' model of singularity in identity when in fact the evidence suggests a more dynamic emergent model is relevant for 21st century challenges."

20,000 years ago the climate was in an Ice Age period, and the seal level was more than 100 meters lower than today. Men were already modern Homo sapiens sapiens, not much change until now, so when the temperatures rose again, some 10-12,000 years ago, and the sea rose some 130 meters, the flood must have imprinted the collective memory ! Considering that most people most likely lived near the sea, deltas, big rivers, this must have been an incredible change ! Of course it didn't happen in a day, but at some points the rains and sea rise must have been brutal !

UgiLNWRtaUe1_HgCoAEC,Verbal Learning,1503284652653,"As someone who is skeptical of the nature of religious experiences i don't think it's necesserily correct to describe the pessimitic view of these drug induced experiences as mentall illness or delusions. I think i'd categorize it a bit more broadly and   say that religious experience is something that can be or is induced by neural chemistry. So if our neuro chemistry is capable of creating these experiences and we can engineer drugs to replicate these effects or create ones that are similar or indistinguishable it suggests to to me at least that if people have religious experiences outside of drugs, it's more likely to be caused by them having somehow managed to get their neuro chemistry into a state that induced said religious experience, as opposed to it being them accessing transcendant knowledge either from god, the universe, or the collective unconcsious etc.

Therefore the most simplest and most logical explanation for the time being is that the experience is rooted in biology and therefore has explainable causational links that are currently too complex for us to answer comprehensively with our knowledge of the brain as it is today. Rather than being proof of some sort of deeper cosmological connection between our brains and the universe.

The psychology of the flood is this, we are horrendous people filled with hate, bitterness, jealousy, rage, envy, strife, covetousness, sexual immorality, self righteousness, slander, gossips, lovers of self, disrespectful to parents, vile, ungrateful and materialistic...... Because of the wickedness of man and the angels,  God wiped out the world and started again with only Noah and his 7 family members. God has said he would cleansed the world again only this time it won't be water. It'll be fire. So sort yourselves out because for these sins we hurt and murderer each other.

Also, while some lectures will indeed be ""done"", like your example on Freud, there are plenty of areas that are still in need of a lot of progress, and those lectures would need regular updating, creative approaches, and more discussion-oriented courses. Exciting! Nobody can start it, because it has already started, and nobody can finish it, because it is the on-going future. What people can do is to help forward it.

My own prediction is that about 30% of the curriculum will end up being along the lines of a much better Self-Authoring sort of thing (this is not to take away from what now exists, but there is a lot of progress needed in this backwards area of human knowledge, and these are early days). In other words, self-knowledge work is an essential part of a real education.... for everyone."

She said, ""You should be"".   Ouch!  I knew the meaning.  Maturity and seriousness: I got it, immediately.  Today, I would still try peyote, but under conditions:  with friends, with a goal, with respect.  I don't use my brain as a toy anymore.

So she goes to find ""Eden"", the paradisic beach where her deceased mother found out she was pregnant with her. But rather than finding tranqulity she is flooded by chaos in the shape of a sea monster, a vicious white shark. By the skin of her teeth she subdues chaos and kills the shark.

UgjodAxA_hmn0ngCoAEC,yomajo,1503284702028,I have been digging through JBP videos for more than half a year now. Today I watched Hitchens talk at Google from 2007 or 2008. Couldn't believe how simple minded those atheists seem to be. Thank you soo much for all the work you have done so far and for these series particularly. I'm certain at least 90% so called atheists have no idea what they claim does not exist. I know I didn't.
