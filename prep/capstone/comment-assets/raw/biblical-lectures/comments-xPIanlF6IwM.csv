Ugw1Tf6Iav7ZxExgpJZ4AaABAg,Space Bike,1533006812370,"This comment is for the viewers. After reading some of the comments I realize some of you are mistaking this for Scripture. While Jordan's metaphoric analysis of the Bible is thought provoking, it is a metaphoric analysis nonetheless, and is inherently secular. Do not mistake this intellectual work for a spiritual one. For the atheists who claim to be religious now, you still aren't saved. You must ask Jesus to forgive you and believe that He died to atone for your sin. If you thirst for God and hunger for His Word, read the Bible for yourself. Start with the Gospels. Otherwise, just appreciate this for what it is and not as doctrine."

I think turning Jordan Peterson‚Äôs work into a meme belittles his material and turns it into a parody. It ironically satirises Jordan Peterson into Broscience and Bromemes about ‚ÄúJust clean your room bro‚Äù, I really question whether those commenters have even read the 12 Rules of Life or if they even understand Jungian Psychology and Nietzsche which  Peterson frequently refers to. I‚Äôm a little turned off and averse to Jordan Peterson being used as a Self Help Bromeme. I find that the most meaningful thing I learnt from Jordan Peterson was that he reccomended Intuitive Open Creatives to engage Jungian Therapy, this has really helped me. Also, his discussion of mythology about Jepetto, Pinocchio, has really helped me develop myself. I hope that Jordan‚Äôs work legitimately helps those who need it, and hopefully even the Bromemers."

I understand Dr Peterson's theory on sacrifice but I think there comes a point in our realization or circling deeper within ourselves to where its not a sacrifice because being attuned to the good we begin to realize is the only thing we want and want nothing else, therefore it changes to not a sacrifice but what we want. We feel its a sacrifice when we know something else would be better for us but our obstinate ego would rather do something else but the something else means suffering.  It can take eons of this suffering before we willingly want and would rather  do the better thing. I believe Christ only wanted the good thing,, being one with God, and wanted to lead us in the right way toward that for the good of all."

With that in mind:
 Is Ideological war-propaganda  to exclude expectations from one area and put them on another area while you can make impossible for people to thinking their past because is disgusting. 
So you can be the only person that gives them the expectations, so you can be the only one that you can organize their specialties and at last organize their needs, then you have them trapped, because they can do only one thing(speciality), they can't find informations from past because (you made the past distgusting to search), they have similar needs with you, so you can put these people in the direction you want, but the people that excluded from this future would create chaos (for the state or in the state).
I don't want to talk about cospiracy theories, I talk about our natural state that when we are immorals ideological conflicts comes natural

Christianity gave the the grouping of errors. Grouping the corrects and the errors at the same time, maybe gave at west civilization the advantage (opinion, don't know)


Maybe that's the reason the christians said love, for people to stop excluding others from their expectations for the future. 

Is that right ?

There can't be shadows without light so there can only be an absence of truth for there to be falsehood.
One important thing to realize when talking about enlightened beings is that your conception of self is NON-EXISTENCE it isn't even an illusion like Sam Harris says it is oh and the meaning of life becomes self evident it's questionable whether you should even breathe it's unmistakable. Realizing this is what zen buddhist called the void which is past oneness which is what the New Age talks about. 
There's spirituality and then there's religion. Spiritually most religions converge to a single point pretty simple: 1. Don't take the mind seriously 2. Forgive everyone no exceptions so that you will be forgiven 3. Love as a state of being in the world 4. Always have good intentions and try to be a good person. 
The world you see doesn't even exist. Your emotions and the way you see the world are just a consequence of your intentions but it's ultimately nature that's doing everything. Jordan B Peterson is pretty close to figuring out the levels of consciousness chart David Hawkins taught from which is pseudoscience but that's what religion/spirituality is so..."

UgyY2L0LxC_39wUpoNJ4AaABAg,Baltori Xervo,1529550821041,"what i dont understand: Jordan Peterson talks about how ones father has to die so the person can become an individual themselves. having your father die atleast metaphorically frees us and makes us think for ourselves. but why is he against athemism them? if we have to let our old believes die to improve and to become better, that would exactly fit into atheism, because god is like the father who we can always turn to and ask questions instead of thinking for ourselves. god helped us shape our behavior and create a moral system, but maybe belief cant take us any further than that, since god cant make decissions for us and it is for us to decide how we shape the rest of our lives and our world after we already learned everything we could from him. maybe even some of our old beliefs have to be dropped in order to improve and to become better. the belief in god and life after death is just like the wall that keeps all the bad away from us and protects us from the fear we would have of death otherwise. the belief in god has helped us build a society based on positivity, but denied us of thinking for ourselves and ultimately see what is good or bad, because we havent been thinking outside of the box just yet, which might be for example finding a way to eternal life for everyone, because dying ultimately means dying. also some modern ideas through the eyes of the kuran or the bible would be viewed as unethical or immoral, like creating robots that are smarter than us and arent natural and ""against gods plan"", which to me sounds wrong. 
if we believe that someone who pursues eternal life is mislead, maybe we are due to our wrong beliefs. isnt wanting to die of old age just as suicidal as jumping off a skyscraper?
Dr. Peterson says that religion is the fundament of our society and believs and that it wouldnt work without it, but why? Religion is the set of rules we followed that led us to the current state, but that doesnt mean we should be afraid of improving, which even by his view means that finding errors in the current state is essential and they have to be replaced by something new.
even if god existed, wouldnt he be proud of us thinking for ourselves and being truly independent of him, which in the end is the goal that humanity is trying to reach since the beginning.
our current society methaphorically still is gods child which is afraid of him not protecting us from all the bad and unknown there is."

This task gives me so much to do that I have no time or any other. Let me point out that if we were all to live in that way we would need no armies, no police, no diplomacy, no politics, no banks. We would have a meaningful life and not what we have now‚Äîmadness. What nature asks of the apple-tree is that it shall bring forth apples, and of the pear-tree that it shall bring forth pears. Nature wants me to be simply man. But a man conscious of what I am, and of what I am doing. God seeks consciousness in man.

This is the truth of the birth and the resurrection of Christ within. As more and more thinking men come to it, this is the spiritual rebirth of the world. Christ, the Logos‚Äîthat is to say, the mind, the understanding, shining into the darkness. Christ was a new truth about man. Mankind has no existence. I exist, you exist. But mankind is only a word. Be what God means you to be; don‚Äôt worry about mankind which doesn‚Äôt exist, you are avoiding looking at what does exist‚Äîthe self. You are like a man who leans over his neighbor‚Äôs fence and says to him: ‚ÄúLook, there is a weed. And over there is another one. And why don‚Äôt you hoe the rows deeper?

Maybe it's because many of them are fundamentally fundamentalists in their interpretation of the bible. Perhaps, a path that goes from Jordan Peterson, then to Andy Stanley, then joining a more biblically consistent church lead by likes that of a Dr. James White or a Dr. Michael Brown will be something a few men and women.   will do.  Jordan comes off like a modern gnostic, but he is probably educating himself with sound (non-fundy) evangelical commentaries."

UgymwSSC2z6DgDi1X7Z4AaABAg,Shnarkle VonBarkle,1526872421107,"Re:  ""there has to be a bridge between the knowable and the unknowable"".  Is this suggesting that the unknowable can be known, or did he mean to say the non knowable rather than the unknowable?  He then says that ""reality requires an observer"".  I would then ask why simple awareness isn't sufficient?  While one may have an awareness of their observations, one needn't observe what they are aware of, and one must ask who is aware of what one is observing?.  Awareness encompasses much more than observation.  The kingdom itself cannot be observed, and the kingdom is nothing less than ultimate reality.   The kingdom cannot be subject to observation.

There can be no mediator to reality other than reality (itself); this is Christ.  What is most important to ourselves is ourselves, and this is precisely what has to be eliminated, and this is precisely what Christ says: ""Deny yourself"", which is to say deny the self itself.  This is to cut at the root of the problem.  The problem is that we all identify so closely with the persona that we mistakenly believe it is who we are.  The only life that can be tragic and malevolent is our own.  Language must reflect the death of the genitive of possession if we are to shake the intellect free of these chains which bind our selves to each other.  The only conception that need ever be erased is that of our own separate identity, then our lives would no longer be our own.  They would then belong to Christ Who created this world in, with, through, and for Christ.  This is life eternal, and it cannot be possessed or observed.  

To identify with what we want to identify with only spotlights our separation.  While identification is closely linked to identity, identity is not identification, and as long as we are seeking to be identified we will always fall short of that unknown shore.  The Spirit abolishes the self while enabling the reality of the Logos to manifest the reality of transcendence immanent in, with, and through the Logos/Christ.  This erases the deception of objectively worshipping what cannot objectively exist(except for idolaters) in the first place and instead subjectively allows, perhaps one would say compels; worship ""in Spirit and Truth"" to take place ""in the midst"" of the  children of God.

The bridge or mediator to transcendence is the Spirit-filled Logos immanent in reality."

UgyILxf-gnl-da4dArZ4AaABAg,Ray Caesar,1526872424550,"Thank you Jordan. I have found these and all your lectures very inspiring and thought provoking. I like the way they stretch our awareness and expand the idea of what existence is and I am trying to listen to them multiple times to fully understand all the implications in my own evolving and changing perception of existence. You truly have a wonderful mind and I like that by listening to your thoughts they become rather contagious.

I have often thought that the conscious world of objective reality and scientific study very good for answering questions about ""What is the nature of practical existence"" in a world of concrete reality using logic and reason, and this functions well with an atheistic mindset. In this world I ""choose"" to see myself as a sort of Scientific Atheist and look for practical and reasonable answers to the world I find around me. Although just because I utilize a Atheistic mindset ...I am not an Atheist in entirety and just because I take a scientific approach its worth noting I live my life as an Artist.

I have also thought that this is not the only world we live in. We also live in a subconscious inner universe of emotions and subjective reality with a wider range of possibilities. In this world it is not as important to explain the world as it is ...but to explain how to be ...how to exist and how to act...and give existence meaning and self definition based on moral action and intuition. It is in this realm of possibility that even reality can be questioned and the realization that the chair we see sitting in the middle of the room may just be a construct of conscious awareness. It is this world I exist as an Artist using all the stories and archetypes as a guide in a very subconscious realm of emotion and feeling and psychological mystery...I not only believe in God in this realm  but I believe in all the Gods  because the archetypes of spiritual enlightenment must exist beyond the mere mortal in order to grow.  This is a goal I set for myself during this period I define as ""my Life"". All The stories and archetypes of all human history exist because we are not just logical creatures ...we are more and we need more! we need meaning and Art and Passion and something beyond our imagining to make us leap into an abyss with nothing but hope and the possibility that that leap is distanced further by by something more when all else is gone. I feel on a emotional gut level this is what makes us Human ..and that Humanity is hopefully evolving.  These mythological spiritual stories are a different kind of ""Belief"" than reason and logic but are not in spite of them.  I love that our inner spiritual universe exists wonderfully balanced with the outside conscious practical universe and this is the beauty of human Duality. I find that there is an amazing synchronicity to this balance that is almost pure Art.

I love that these two universes exist in a balanced Yin and Yang or Jungian duality as we really don't know if one is the inner universe and the other the outer universe as they very well could be reversed based on whether concrete reality exists as a construct of the mind and conscious awareness.

So ...I find myself existing in two worlds ...one as an Atheist with scientific questions of logical reason and the other as a open minded Theist and Artist in a subconscious world of Self Definition, Emotion, Empathy and Morality and spirituality  utilizing all the history and myth of all Gods and Mortals of all human existence.  As an Artist I occupy these two worlds very comfortably and it seems quite emotionally reasonable that I live in two distinct and separate universes that have different laws of physics. I suppose I believe this because I choose to!  and I also I choose to think that the concepts of ""Belief"" or ""Disbelief"" are of a a lesser quantity than  ""WONDER""."

I'm still in the process of watching this video, but this is where I've paused for now because I feel compelled to address what you've stated at this point and I will possibly add to this post as I continue to watch this video. But to address the issues that you brought up of God requiring Abraham to prove his faith by being willing to sacrifice his only son, Isaac - this is addressed in Hebrews 11:19 -

""Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.""

God promised to Abraham prior to Isaac being born that a nation would emerge from Abraham's offspring (through Isaac) and that this offspring would be as numerous as ""the stars in the sky"". Abraham believed God's promise to him because he had faith and realized that his sovereign God, the creator of the heavens and the earth (as well as the designer of human beings) could raise his son from the dead if need be just as easily as God had brought forth a child from a 90+ year old woman who was barren. 


NOTHING is too hard for the Lord or beyond possibility. This is something that God reminds us of more than once:

Genesis 18:14
Is any thing TOO HARD for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.


Jeremiah 32:27
Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?


Matthew 19:26
But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.


You have to believe in the power of the supernatural God and let go of a materialistic world view for this to even begin to register. You have to humble yourself to the fact that the God of the bible is transcendent and isn't limited to the VERY limited understanding of humans. And God is not limited to the physical and intellectual confines that we, his creations, are limited to. 

Isaiah 44:24-25
24 Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

25 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth WISE MEN backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;


This is why the established system of academia for men is ultimately, futile and worthless in God's sight:

2 Timothy 3:7
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

As Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Jerusalem asked Jesus when he was accused of the Sanhedrin, WHAT is the ""TRUTH""? 



You said at 1:00:37 - ""Christ is symbolically the way and the truth of life""

I'm sorry, I have to correct that:

John 14:6
Jesus saith unto him, I AM (literally) the way, the *TRUTH*, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.


You said it yourself before, Mr. Peterson. Intellect doesn't = virtue. And if I may add to that, it doesn't even mean that a person has wisdom, at least not in the godly sense. God gives true wisdom and insight to those that are humble, lowly and even simple.  


Matthew 11:25

At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.


Why did Jesus say the truth is revealed to babes/children?


Matthew 18:3

And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as *little children*, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Man's hubris, pride, ""intellect"", etc. in combination with our fallen state and the lies of Satan prevent us from receiving the truth which is only found in Jesus Christ. You can't dissect God in a petri dish and you can't examine him under a microscope nor can you try to rationalize or discern why he does what he does all the time. He is above us and beyond us. You will never in all your lifetime even with all the studying you can squeeze into 80+ years of living ever hope to understand him. 

This isn't blind faith that has lead me to this conclusion but rather honest reason and true wisdom. The book of Job emphasizes this kind of coming to this humble realization quite a bit, but, Isaiah sums it up pretty nicely:


Isaiah 55:9
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are MY WAYS HIGHER THAN YOUR WAYS, and MY THOUGHTS THAN YOUR THOUGHTS.

The truth is this:

For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life,.

Jesus dying on the cross and his being buried and resurrected is not a metaphor or anything like that. It's not some profound life lesson shrouded in an allegory - it was literal. He died for our sins. That's it. That's the truth and it's simple. That's why Jesus said it's been revealed to children and hidden from the ""wise"".

God bless you, Mr. Peterson. I prayed that you will read this and that God will open your mind, heart and soul to the truth that is only found in Jesus Christ."

That was until I had a profound spiritual experience during a water fast in solitude. I came to believe in Jesus Christ and set out to know whether what I believed was true. So I decided to prove the bible wrong. I read it 4 times through over the following 2 years and also studied a variety of ancient texts from many different viewpoints and belief systems.

I love your stuff Jordan and my challenge to you would be to stop trying to understand the bible and start trying to prove it wrong. I think it will take you to a different level of understanding along the way.

My other challenge would be to take a serious look at your understanding of Darwin‚Äôs Theory of Evolution. It‚Äôs a house of cards with no scientific of empirical evidence to back it up.

This can be taken a step further, once the process completes here on earth after the flesh decays the conscious part of our being goes onto another rebirth which can be interpreted as a reincarnation but not in the traditional sense. If we‚Äôve reached far enough in the development process on earth we move onto the next level or dimension so to speak(what it is exactly i don‚Äôt know because obviously we‚Äôre still here). If we fail to complete the process adequately our consciousness is reborn here once again in the human form with past consciousness/progress embedded in what can only be explained as DNA with no memory of past life aside from the flickering d√©j√† vu from time to time... it is important not to get wrapped by any philosophy or any religion or anything else in order to keep your mind open to the truth, which is always available to those who can accept it."

It lays out an argument for interpreting the first few chapters of Genesis as an ancient Near Eastern document written for an ancient Near Eastern people. The focus, therefore, is not a chronological history of the material creation, but rather an account of God ordering the universe as a temple for Him to inhabit; the role of humanity was to further order the world and bring it to it's full potential. After Adam and Eve's failure, only Christ the God-Man can bring about the consummation by His death and resurrection - which was God's purpose from the start. Needless to say that's a high level overview and I'm not doing it justice, but the parallels between his exegesis and the arguments you make during your Biblical series are staggering.

In this video he speaks in difinitive statement that don't have that quest for understanding all the possible depths and layers of meaning and interpretation.

But you don‚Äôt get to do this. You don‚Äôt get to reinvent the Christian faith to correspond to your naturalist presuppositions. It doesn‚Äôt even hold together on a philosophical level---although I hear Bultmann tried. 

 Aristotle would say to you that Christ cannot be both raised and not raised; God and not God, dead in a grave and also ascended to the Father. Aristotle would condemn a religion apparently rooted in history, while in fact predicated on this supra-natural concept of ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù which you posit over against the mere history set forth in the New Testament. He would say: ""You can't build meaning on myth.""  Myth has no validity apart from history, and I put it to you that Christianity is rooted in propositional historical fact. 

The Apostle John, late in life, said: ‚ÄúThat which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our eyes and which our hands have handled concerning the Word of life‚Äî-for the life was manifested, and we have seen it‚Äî-that is what we declare to you.‚Äù I John 1.  In I Corinthians 15, St. Paul likewise declares the historical, propositional fact of the resurrection of Jesus as ‚Äúa matter of first principles,‚Äù the falsification of which would render him and all believers a ‚Äúfools‚Äù and a ‚Äúmen to be most pitied.‚Äù 

The Apostles suffered martyrdom for their confession about Jesus. They would have thrown your message out of the Church. 
With respect: You don‚Äôt get to come along in 2017 and suck the profitable ‚Äúmythos‚Äù out of the historic ‚Äúhusk‚Äù which you deem the Gospel to be. First; it‚Äôs bad history. Secondly: It‚Äôs atrocious philosophy. Third, it's simply not the gospel. It's a humanistic message stuffed into the skin of a gospel narrative.

I know you are full of noble motivation. You don't believe the confession, but you want to hold to what is good. You don't believe because the academy has washed your brain of every cosmological assumption needful to believe the history of God‚Äôs acts to save humankind. You want to hear from God. You wish God would break into history, but you approach the gospel history with a presupposition that there is no God and that any claim that He has ever broken into the natural chain of causation must be false on its face. But you have this mindset that‚Äôs just because you‚Äôve had a bad education. The devil, who showed Christ all the kingdoms of this age, boasted that he has all power to give lordship and power to whomever he desires. Our academy is no exception to this truthful boast. St. Paul called him ‚Äúthe god of this age,‚Äù who ‚Äúblinds the minds of those who believe not the gospel.‚Äù 

The gospel is an historical record of God taking on human form, and entering into our history. This is the predicate of our union with God; in that, in Christ, He has become our brother. There is no other Gospel. You should stop trying to co-opt this tradition to your purposes, however noble."

You may never see this, but that's OK. If you do, great but if not it's whatever. Anyway, so last night i had a bit of a naive moment and decided to tell my college roommate ( who is an African american girl from the south side of Chicago. I'll let you draw your own conclusions from that) about you. Now, I'll admit I am very bad at explaining things, but i thought i was doing pretty good at explaining some of your views on things. I also tried to tell her to go watch some of your videos because i wanted to let you speak for yourself, to which she said no. As the conversation went on, i was explaining what happened in the video of your talk at Queen's University and how people call you a transphobe and all these things and that's where she stopped listening. She was like ""well, if a lot of people say he is, then he is. And i have trans family members..."" blah blah blah..you dont know him personally so you cant actually know his real views on things...and then she was like ""he sounds like a typical white guy douche. I mean, just look at him."" And i was like ""Uh...he's not. Don't judge a book by it's cover."" 
She got angry. like hella angry. She kept trying to tell me that because of their struggles, black people are good at reading people and that when she first saw me, she read me as a small town white girl who will never amount to anything more than that and will never be successful anywhere but in a small town (for the sake of politeness, I'm excluding the profanities used in her sentences) Her words were actually rather hurtful, so i tried to explain this, and i also tried to explain that that wasn't reading people, but that was just taking one look at them and assuming everything about them. 
She snapped and started screaming at me, telling me that's why I'm a social outcast and that's why i don't have very many friends, and called me a...well she (while still screaming) called me a bitch. At that point, i had run out of the room to remove myself from the situation and had run into the bathroom to escape her. I ended up slipping on the wet floor and cracked my head hard against the tiles (thank god i didn't get a concussion), and later on she told me i was dead to her but  I digress. My reason for saying all this is because i have a question for you...what do i do when faced with a person like this? How...how do i deal with people like this. I'm not good at arguing or debating so i try to avoid this, but i want to know what i should do in a situation like this.

From what I have seen and read of yours my take on truth is this:

The Truth of Being occurs at the intersection of your ancient need for dignified struggle(or fighting) with your modern(last 5,000 yrs) pre-frontal understanding of reality.

Being is a qualia that is malleable depending on the culture and circumstance.

That's why I bet in every religion and culture you find the archetype of the fighter - Jesus, Mohamed, Buddha, they all struggled against stupidity and evil in their own fight for a better world. 

Why we have different religions and fights is because of the minor details that differentiate these narratives but the over arching similarity of all religions seems to be a self-assessed struggle for a better world."

Gen x's media, institution and education output has intentionally the ruined millennial generation with perverted idealogies. They've been bashing us on-line and off-line, we don't defend because we're too busy trying to survive economically and socially.

They've been blaming both Baby-boomer and Millennial for problems of society while putting Gen Z (their own little children) on pedestals as the future savior, at the same time, causing problems for both of us. There should really be a study done on their resentment and reasons for it.

Almost every unbiased study on societal performance shows very little difference between generations in societal functions. Billionaire and co-founder of Paypal, Peter Thiel mentioned Standford University in early 90s were full of Post-Modernist students, that's when education and government faculty of left-wing ideas were 1:1, today, its 14:1 in favor of left, guess how many of them are ""crazy-left""?.. It might of been the gen x's causation. 

Gen x  had a much better job prospect than millennial whom work multiple part time jobs to survive, yet claim millennial as privileged underachievers, and how their own kids are more resourceful with better prospects. Perhaps they used generations as social Guinea Pigs, not wanting to ruin their own precious children.

They hate the younger generations, but not their gen z children, reading the comments by gen z kids about millennial show they've been taught to hate, but we're not channeling our hate on gen x or gen z. Should we? Should reasons and actions be taken against them? That's a theoretical question."

A mere correction. The necessity to work, insofar as it was a part of our purpose in life, existed before the fall. God told the Man to do several things including to have dominion over/subdue/cultivate AKA bring order from the ruggedness (or chaos, if you will) of creation. All of this before the rebellion and the fall.

The curse, in regards to work, was that work would now become toilsome and futile.
You can see this all over in the Wisdom Literature, particularly in the book of Ecclesiastes.
Now work due to thus curse is a chore at times. Things break down. We work inefficiently. Our work taxes our very lives, etc.

No, I think, as an individualist, that man should carve there own moral morality and dreams, and if this leads away from society and thus away from a full potential, then it is still worth striving for, as society might follow one day your wisdom (or not). That is the sacrifice of the vanguard. (It should be sayd that I am an artist, so maybe to be the vanguard is my task in Peterson's view, while the task of others could be to live his/her full potential. As an individualist I however hope that everyone could one day become an individualist.) It could be that Jesus was the first known individualist and that his ultimate sacrifice on the cross was the result of following his own moral morality; while if he lived his full potential with his capacities he could have been a Mohammed who ruled a continent."

A presupposition is an assumption and it isn't necessarily wrong to do this.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presupposition  Assumptions can be very useful in investigatory work and we just need to be very careful with how we proceed with this.  Without assumptions, so presuppositions, there will be NO investigative work!  The requirement is to proceed or work very carefully.  This isn't the first time that I've heard your videos incorrectly or else unclearly speaking of presuppositions, and your lectures are somewhat interesting, albeit a layman can just easily shrug off, say, most of religion; but, you should better explain what you mean by ""presuppositions"".

But:

01:00 ""Conceptualization of the world as objective must remain subordinate to our conceptualization of the world as a place of being."" 
If we do that we risk of conceptualizing an ""objective"" world that fits our wants rather than what it actually is. Do we subordinate how we conduct science so that Flat Earth theories become accepted by science? At this level it won't work. On the other hand I see its usefulness on how we approach doing science when it comes to knowledge that could potentially destroy us. I don't think we can simply swap which conceptualization has priority but rather contextualize where one precedes the other. There's a saying that applies here: ""context is for kings, absolute rule is for lackeys"". 


 45:50 ""reality requires an observer"". 
The only thing that does require an observer is an image of reality. Often the observer confuses the image of reality (which is simple and tailored to the mental abilities of the observer) with reality (infinitely more complex but comprehensible). Is that why people need to blame a creator for the existence of reality? This is on the same level as ""there's nothing else but matter"". So why solipsism is better than nihilism baffles me.

(I do not expect Dr Peterson to respond to this but I'm sure some fellow youtubers surely will pick up on this and straighten me up if they can show me where I fault.)"

It seems to me we are coming into a period when people , secular and religious, are looking for something that can be experienced or communicated -  unmediated, or immediate.  Jesus may have been speaking of something more than trivial when he says, ""I have been telling you all this in metaphors, but the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in metaphors . . . ."" John ch. 16 v.25. Jerusalem Bible. Readers Edition. ( It's kind of a Catholic hippie version).  It seems like the Protestant revolution started on this path and its been creeping along ever since. But the schism between science and poetry was false.  Is there any poetry in high-octane physics?  The best ones seem to think so. 

I know Buber and Jung had some disagreements.  Maybe Buber did not appreciate or understand the psyche well.  Maybe Jung didn't appreciate the ubiquity of the I - It world.  But I find your concept of the ""divine individual"" still bounded as a mediation for a finite category that many Christians want to ask, ""What more"" and find the query as indicative of a lack of recognition.  Complicated: Jesus did come as a kind of mediation for Man to well, better understand, and have a life with Yahweh, or for some,  ""the Elohim figure"".   There is an I - Thou relation that is missing:

Now, obviously one can't stay for long in the I - Thou recognition and relation, but:
"" The world as experience belongs to the basic word I - It.  The basic word I - Thou establishes the world of relation.""
 A good poetic representation of what Buber considers the seeing of everything in the light of the Divine relation :  ""As long as the firmament of the Thou is spread over me, the tempests of causality cower at my heels, and the whirl of doom congeals ""  I'm sure Sam Harris would flip the script there, and spin it in the appropriate atheist way :).
'""World here, God there' --- that is It - talk; and ' God in the world - that, too, is It - talk; but leaving out nothing,  leaving nothing behind, . . . to have nothing besides God but to grasp everything in him, that is the perfect relationship "".

Last, but not least, all this business about establishing certainty and community thru the postulation of a universal Transcendental Ego, or importing an outside ""Divine Agency to make sense of things : ""One does not find God if one remains in the world; one does not find God if one leaves the World . . . ""  I like Dr. Peterson's attempt at redefining divine/world categories.  Swell.  This impasse requires it.

All these quotes by Buber are taken from ""I and Thou"" trans. Walter Kaufmann. Touchstone Books 1996."

False dichotomy.

""Because we are living beings and must make our way pragmatically in the world the second way of looking has to take precedence.""

Non sequitur. If these two premises somehow, through a series of logical steps, necessitates that we see the world fundamentally as a forum for action then you better at least make that argument. That's not to mention the fact that basing your actions on archetypal stories is a theoretical approach thus the exact opposite of pragmatic.

 ""This means that the world as a place of things is nested inside the world as a forum for action.""

Again non-sequitur. Without the concepts of things, we would just see a wash of color and have no idea how to take action. The world as a place of things comes before action necessarily and can not be nested inside it. Further part of the very idea of a thing includes information on how to interact with it so they aren't even separate conceptual landscapes which can be nested within each-other. 

 ""This means that the conceptualization of the world as objective must remain subordinate to our conceptualization of the world as a place of being.""

UgyEOrQbTGhdtQMAG_J4AaABAg,Walter Peretiatko,1524280460321,"Jordan speaks the truth... but this is hardly the truth of the traditional understanding of Christ : a message that is not even remotely passed on by the church.  This is a modern psychological understanding of Christ and, again, there is great truth there.  However, this is not the truth that have been passed down through the centuries of the church.  So what is the more truthful or more important truth? 

Jordan is such a modern in his emphasis on ""action.""  The ancients believed that contemplation was the highest life... not action.  It is only the modern busy beaver that works all day and night and can never quench his addiction to action.  Sure enough great cities and reservoirs of knowledge were built up by workaholics, modern miracles exist that would astonish the ancients.  But didn't the fear action because it could lead to PRIDE that would mean the downfall of man?  They were happy to contemplate the eternal... not change it. 

Mephistopheles in Faust looks to action coming first... and so does Jordan.  Following the human devil Heidegger the best knowledge is based on human use or action.  Look to men's actions that speak louder than words or concepts.  But God is the Word... not the action.  His actions follows the Word.  And here we see the devil flipping it -- like flipping the ends for a mean, Lucifer flipping himself as the means to God to become an end -- so that action is now comes first.  Action precedes the Word or concept.  

Again, this is modern, this is the modern attempt to build Plato's Republic... a project that according to Plato could only come about through chance or through killing off the parents of children designated for the city.  Mass killings -- again not new or unknown in the 20th century.  Jordan makes this point all too often.  Maybe the ancients were right in some respects!"

However, one thing that continually creeps into my mind as I'm listening to you is that you are on a long-term prescription regimen for depression.

The thing about the sacrificial system was that the offering represented Christ, even back thousands of years before He came, and the vegetables offered by Cain were in no way representative of the son of God. The spilling of animal blood couldn't, however, atone for the sins of the sinner, as it was merely the ritualistic demonstration that the person making the offering had faith in the future coming of the Messiah. Men were always absolved by faith, through the merits of Christ. God had instructed Adam crearly about the type of sacrifice to be made, and Cain simply disobeyed  those instructions and chose to be rebellious. That was his transgression."

Nesting the second one in the first one is the ""golden middle"", or, as JBP said many times, its the perfect edge between order and chaos. Its not accidental that that's where the artists live, because to be on that spot, or to even decide permanently to go closer to it, its - art! The process of doing it, is an art! Whoever tried it, knows it. 
I've realized long time ago, that I see the world in black and white, generally speaking, and the gray zones, in that matter, are to be conscientiously avoided, or, if drowned in any, to let it it take the correspondent color. In vast majority of JBP's statements and views, he tends to look at things the same way, and that's mostly why I can relate and agree with all of his views, essentially. Many people I know told me that this trait of mine is too much, and that gray zones are good, constructive and practical. I disagree on that, because gray zones are a form of sheltering and comfort. Like a sweet escape to a postponement of sorting that very thing out. 
This is why I think people who consider religion to be ridiculous, are mistaken. Religion as such, is very straight-forward. Declining it as something unnecessary, makes the door fully open to a gray zone. Not the God Himself, that's a a category of personal preference, and its not a thing I'm talking about here, but the Religion as a human construct, or its story and message, if you'd like. 
I've always seen religion as an additional, voluntary, useful and noble burden. That's exactly what JBP claims, in this or that way. Being religious means to have that burden carried as better as possible and to lean towards that process, nested in any form of denomination (excluding the sects ofc, because that's out of the topic and its another subject anyways). 
Also, this view was present in many forms and I've red it, heard it and seen it many times, before I knew about JBP. He (only) ultimately and brilliantly confirms it, as far as I'm concerned.

Ugz-p3HtvYfWkqXI9lh4AaABAg,Christopher Rivera,1524280464367,"Alex Kierkegaard: 789. Weak people need the old religions, for what are they to do in their hours of greatest weakness? They need an interpretation of existence that relieves their suffering. This interpretation must be based on a model of the universe, a schematic of the rest of the universe outside themselves, and this schema will of course be greatly simplified. All models are simplifications anyway, and given that we are talking about weak people here (which means: slow in the head and/or body, but above all in the head, since our species' greatest strength is intelligence) theirs will be an especially simplified model; an absurd caricature of reality, when all is said and done; a grossly simplified and exaggerated image of it, but still nevertheless an image of it, which is to say a view of the universe from a certain perspective. And just as a mole's view of the forest is extremely murky and basic and simple while an imaging satellite's is vastly clearer and more complex ‚Äî but still depicts the same object nevertheless: the forest, and hence is by no means entirely dissociated from reality ‚Äî is not a ""pure fantasy"" in other words, and certainly contains an amount of truth in it and useful information, such that for someone who had seen the satellite data and had the capacity to parse it and who was then given an image of the mole's viewpoint, he could identify, if he was perceptive enough, that yes, they depict the same forest, and here is a clump of trees that is common to both viewpoints, only at a different resolution and viewed from different angles, so will the philosopher treat the old religions' particular beliefs, examining each in turn and pronouncing them extremely murky and simplistic, yes, but still ultimately true, when all is said and done. 
   To find the truth in religion ‚Äî in the old religions, which is to say those extremely simplistic and grossly exaggerated absurd caricatures of philosophical systems that our ancestors constructed and which are so outdated that no one believes in them (i.e. no one uses them) anymore: that is a task that only an Overman can tackle. For everyone else sees nothing there: they only see a joke. But it is the understanding of common people that to an Overman is a joke, and the greatest joke is their obstinate, unthinking hazing of philosophy and religion (which is to say of thought). 
746. Don't all religious people ‚Äî regardless of religion: from the ancient polytheists to the modern monotheists ‚Äî believe that they will be reunited with their loved ones ""after death"" somewhere? But that's also precisely what the Eternal Recurrence says ‚Äî with the little caveat that we'll also be reunited with all those people that we hate, of course, or just generally dislike: which is precisely what the atheists believe, in their own way, when they say that we don't have to look far for heaven and hell, since they are both right here, right now. 
   See how everyone ultimately agrees on everything, if you know how to interpret what they say correctly? Which is to say, if your grasp of semiotics and psychology is so complete that you can jump between worldviews almost as easily as a translator does between the languages that he knows. And while language translation is possible because all languages ultimately express the same things: mankind's feelings; worldview translation is possible because all worldviews express the same thing too: the world, which all of us, of course, inhabit. 
676. A great mistake the anti-religious fanatics make is lumping all religions together under the label of ""religion"" as if they were equal. But Nietzsche has clearly explained that Christianity stands lower than Buddhism, and Buddhism stands lower than the pagan religions of the various nations ‚Äî and especially those of classical antiquity ‚Äî which themselves stand lower then the religion of the future: philosophy/Overman worship. So... if by ""the comeback of religion"", which, it is now dawning on some, may now be under way, they mean ""the comeback of faith"" ‚Äî after the temporary reduction in our estimation of the value of faith caused by the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution ‚Äî they are correct. But the faith that will dominate and shape the future is no longer the faith in external gods, but in the gods within us. 
56. Linguistic optics: the time for it has come. The idea is basically that no one (and nothing) is ""wrong""; they can't be wrong because they are part of the universe, and whatever is in their brains ‚Äî in the brains of even the stupidest person ‚Äî is as ""correct"" as what's in my mind or Nietzsche's or Baudrillard's. What we need then is an art of interpretation so subtle and powerful that it can bring out the ""truth"" that's hiding inside even the dumbest person's brains. 
   For example, when a Christian says ""God created the universe and he loves me"", he is not wrong. It's just that the concepts he designates with the words ""God"", ""universe"" and ""love"" are different from the concepts someone smart and educated, like me for instance, designates. For me the word ""God"", going by the Christian's definition of omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, etc., is an empty word, a non-concept, since the predicates the Christian attaches to it are incommensurate with each other. But when the Christian says ""God"", he doesn't really mean an ""omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good being"" (since he's so dumb he can't even grasp what these concepts mean, and hence uses them in ape-like and parrot-like fashion); he simply means ""a very powerful being"". Similarly, when he says ""universe"" he doesn't mean what I mean by ""universe"" (i.e. ""everything""), he simply means ""the earth"" ‚Äî or at most, if he's had a whiff of astronomy, perhaps ""the solar system"". And finally, when he says ""love"" he doesn't mean what I mean by ""love"" (i.e. a desire for possession, in order to shape the thing possessed), but the exact opposite, i.e. ""help me"" (= shape me). 
   So basically, when the Christian says ""God created the universe and he loves me"", what he's really saying, translated in our language, is ""A very powerful being created the earth (or the solar system), and he wants to help me"" ‚Äî which could very well be true! 
   All of this stems from Nietzsche's positive theory of language, which basically says that a word means WHAT THE SPEAKER WANTS IT TO MEAN, and has no necessary connection to any pre-existing convention between speaker and listener. Ultimately, each person gives his own meaning to every word, which is only natural since this meaning is to be found inside each person's brain, and all brains are different."

The rule for all of us is perfectly simple. Do not waste time bothering whether you 'love' your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less. There is, indeed, one exception. If you do him a good turn, not to please God and obey the law of charity, but to show him what a fine forgiving chap you are, and to put him in your debt, and then sit down to wait for his 'gratitude', you will probably be disappointed. (People are not fools: they have a very quick eye for anything like showing off, or patronage.) But whenever we do good to another self, just because it is a self, made (like us) by God, and desiring its own happiness as we desire ours, we shall have learned to love it a little more or, at least, to dislike it less."

To see art of woolly rhinos, mammoths, and cave lions drawn by people who had actually seen them - incredible! But more than that, the art is some of the oldest in the world, it's the first real signs of the emergence of modern human consciousness - the first somebodys trying to make sense of the world.

What's the purpose of life if we live and then die .
What's the purpose if you accomplished everything you want and then they put you in the grave .
What's the purpose of your life if you don't know why you are here 
 To know your creator that's for sure 
 Just follow his beloved prophet Muhammed
Didn't you know he tells the truth 
He showed you the way of heaven for sure 
who is GOD , he is One,
 He neither begets nor is born,
Just read Quran and follow the path
Of believers you will never doubt
That you will be the happiest one 
In this life and the after one
Don't tell your lord when the time will come 
That you didn't know or you didn't saw
His true signs that he is the one ."

I think this way of looking at things explains why humanity, especially religious humanity, can be such a disappointment. 
On a more curious note, JBP does a great job of explaining the significance of the ultimate sacrifice in the Christian context. Oddly enough, out of all the Christian religions, the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses carry out a ritual equivalent to Easter where the faithful are offered the opportunity to share in Jesus‚Äô death through partaking of the bread and wine. It is expected that almost every one of them will refuse the tokens except for a minority of established figures in their organisation. Any exceptions to this understanding are viewed as mentally ill persons. I had become used to the idea as just an idiosyncrasy but from the perspective of this video, it is a very strange rejection of the very personal commitment to sacrifice one‚Äôs life for the sake of all."

I believed in equality and then learned that it doesn't exist and causes all chaos and progress at the same time through suffering and the true inequality that creates progress. I believe that the lie in the garden was the lie of equality, the serpent said; ""eat this and you'll be like god"" when that is a lie and it suggested equality with God to the ignorant that wanted equality. i think, are we always trying to work backward and find out the fundamental flaw of our suffering to the root of it, and are we knowing what that is but denying it because of our own desire to have it ""equality""? those who have solved their socioeconomic problems abandoned equalitybut still preach it to others."

Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. [2] For by it the elders obtained a good report. [3] Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. [4] By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. [5] By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. [6] But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him........"

I get that the Christian moral is what is the basis for western civilization, yet now it seems outdated unnecessary and untrue. Either JBP is putting forth the importance of Christianity through wishful or ignorant dogmatic thinking (which I don't think is likely) or I have missed something.

Even given that Christianity is true, or at least is worth exploring, what relationship is JBP advocating towards god anyways? He explains it in psychological terms, which implies that it holds significance even without the metaphysical, yet he is unwilling to dispense with the metaphysical completely. Should we read the bible as a casual self-help book, an instructional book on how to live the best way, or gods words in writing?

It is both simultaneously. Jung started it, but Dr. Peterson popularized it and illuminated it for the masses, especially for the more objective thinkers. This is a natural and timely progression, especially as we have started dealing with and creating Artificial Intelligence. AI (at least an AI design to be more than just a set of purely reactionary brute force set of states) is an intelligence that is made purely of inanimate objects that must learn from its past, deal with the present, and plan for the future. It is a thing of objects that must deal with a world of actions."

UgzUsmd0xKgzP6PAUFJ4AaABAg,John Smith,1524280482952,"Doc P., I wonder if you would please add to your intellectual ammo belt two short parts of Roger Penrose's monumental single volume, ""The Road to Reality"" (Knopf 2006). You are likely aware of R. Penrose as Rouse Ball Professor (philosophy in mathematics) of Mathematics at Oxford, or from his work with Hawking (R.I.P.).

1. The 22 pg. long Section 1, ""The roots of science - the quest for the forces that shape the world,"" particularly the graphic figures 1.3 & 1.4. Then if you please,

2. ... to the back of the volume for section 34, ""Where lies the road to reality?"" particularly fig. 34.1, an evolution of figs 1.2-4. 

The very simple diagrams in question are near in character your ""place of things / forum for action"" but in tripartite form: the physical, the mental, and the Platonic, in a nested cycle. My instinct is that you may endorse Dr Penrose view as underlying/superseding your own.

Thanks Doc, you are always at interesting for you passion for your subject matter."

But when the time came what I found to be true, was the opposite of what I had been lead to believe.  When you have kids, if you truly love them and wish for them to succeed, you will make personal sacrifices, and in the end if you look back, you will see that the scales did not fall out of balance, and in many cases they will have tipped greater in your favor.  This is the power of real sacrifice.  You will give everything you have in you to your children, and in return the rewards will be great and plentiful."

Ugwh_wQkPbBMlQro2yZ4AaABAg,Darren Wimbleton,1524280486326,"Listened to the first ten minutes of this. Jordan says that the Biblical account (theology) of sacrifice begins with Cain and Abel, but doesn't it begin in the account of the fall, with God himself clothing Adam and Eve with the skins of animals? (Gen 3:21) The idea of 'covering' or 'clothing' is important to the Biblical narrative, and strongly intertwined with the theme of sacrifice. If the 'skin' of Genesis 3 is the skin of a slain animal, then we have a 'blood' covering. The shedding of blood (the taking of life, the giving of life) is embedded in many if not all early cultures. This would also effect how we view the difference between Cain and Abel's offering. Cain offered the fruit of his labour - work; but Abel offers blood. Abel is also viewed by Jesus as the first prophet, one whose righteous blood is spillt. There is also in Scripture a contrast drawn between the blood of Abel (and perhaps other Old Testament prophets) which cries out for justice or vengeance, and the blood of Christ that 'speaks a better word'. Christian martyrdom, seen first in the stoning of Stephen and his plea to God for the forgiveness of his murderers, is sometimes described as the 'life' of the church, because it propagates faith; in the first instance, in the conversion of Paul who is complicit in Stephen's death."

In which harnassies and destroys lives, and does not stand or defend whats write, but self serves its own self ot sell out to exploitive model of society. What is then human or organized or prospect of the futre. So yeah, therea re men that would rather serve femaels ot get laid, causing pain within society rather than working as a group together, and then the manipulation of worlds ot further then sell out their lineages beaseu of lreation to other groups, in a guise of peace, but remove their own brother form their house, in meaning from culture, causing ruin... I am a normal person, what am i capapble of.. astronomy, engineering, doctor, computer programing, what are the obstacles that have manifested before me, word games, money, poltics, and the left verse right, controlled narrative, and slavery groups of organized social and societal control, when simply less then a hundred years ago, one just buys land and soverigns over it with their own works, and takes care of their own steed, and so a great false thign is present in which offers free works and labours for excahnges of money, but in reality is a war machine of great deception nad theft... It takes in order to submit and subdue and reduce a populace... So then what is freedom. Life itslf is work. The dignity of life is brought to ruin by these idiots that steal information, take ones land and home nad dare to own all. The worst thing ever to exist is taxation, that enabled the inflation and liquidation fo s oicety for monopolies and more... THisworld does not get smarter or better, it is becoming nothing more then a shadow of its  former glory, but society and its lies are so easy persuaded ot accept bullshit. women attacking men by state Pr... education and prosperity sold off for short selfish gains, rather than simple works of one another... so for one to say as punishment man must work.. is in error. and sacrifice... is such a tool... the entire society is designed ot force anyone without capital in such away to be brainwashed into sub set or military and or punishment by said police force. The use ofinfation removes ones property and owrks. and the use of taxation encroaches and robs heritage lands of people far more intelligent thatn today. That is Babylon the idiot crew that cannto solve  or tie its own shoe, and they belive they have fooled the entire earth into accepting them as god. Kissinger by hs mass capital stated we are like gods now. Well in fact no, and what you had done was make society submit and lose massive intelligent investment into its core ina civil means which is forcing ongoing military structure rather than social structure.. and slower pace, so I often find that Eygptian war mongers that seat themselves upon the throne teach greed and avarice and use it as a game, rather than allowing natural teaching and being informed, and thus without ones capital you are forced in a hell fo a social game, whereas understanding  andeducaiton you are allowe ot bypass such and contribute works. hwoever, whe na bias such as women only or other means ofwomen just attacking for whatever reason nad or males, or even foreigners stating hey let us in your raist, is the most fucked up nonsense I have ever hear dor should ever hear, and so the alloweance of these groups as seen. in 40 years a removal of law,s and education ,and grnts nad programs put forth from the state. i would sooner, then at that point join military because these groups came in by means of theft and sotle inhertances inw hich we endowed nd fought ot protect and since this is anarrative game, it would then require if I do not wish to paly their game any more analyse  the entire house and its crimes against I the individual that hsoudl have a common ccore and simply e existence by the pr within the minds of many have it so that ieven on man I as with challenging each other as in fun score 96-97% in a bio class, stated to me that MY kind does not work. I stated we work in the means of sovereignty it is you that does not work as you only work for a collective ideal in which is in error. OUr logic is one learns much from having their own land ot till and work and keep ship shaped.. it also allowed children ot grow healthier.. hereas this model is organized private cpatial and ocntorl of assets and economic s and that udnermiens the health of society by cuasing un eeded cpiatl stresses and rmeoves freeom. ut hey.. I am the lazy one,..

This lack of knwoeldge in which stomps over as one is so correct, simpy lby the means ofwords or money or authority of position is of grave error against what Christ was truly trying to teach..... So in that regard...  Herodotus... I think that guy withte lamp... in teh day... anyays qhat what is light.. and what is thefuture.. I don't mind collective owrks t ocreate and fly planes, or cool land vehciles of projectile firing I am just stating the wars on this earth are controlled and made up... and creates stress system, and including capital... How many have paid themselves so much gratuity from teh state and tapped their hearts na manipulated contrats amongdt themselves clearly a dysfuntioning state and social dssystem in which now manipatles and panders more bullshit and undermines works, its not ahrd ot see their hand work, for not all life wants to make an empire. and these maen are all teh same, wanting more and more.. crushing their fellow brethren.. clearly they are without light and vision, buta simpleton.. in the manners of creating complex ruin to society.. so yeah therae many avenues ot life.. but i nthe land I reside much of that life is being strangled to fdeath, and military route is being labled as the only avenue.. for those with any principle.. Look at the navy and its array of intellectual control over areas, Not that I am against the practices of the navy, but the cause and affect relation seems ot be missing from teh society for it to acuratly creat easociety in which works.. You can right what ever stat one wants, but if the system is controlled by an ourside of kleptic group and causes strife it is in the enemy. Look at all teh economic roles it controls, its funny when you splcice the system relations of other systemsn and how groups take over other systems.. really just a heartless cruel world at that bpoint far form light. Pardon for the typing but its liagging about 3 minutes behind when i tpyed this, its fun to watch it thought, so I will not be coreting it my bad... lol... Well whatever.. those are my bits...

A couple of days ago I went to church with my parents and mass started with a dark church that progressively got brighter until it was completely lit by 12 am. Then statues of Mary and Christ were carried out of the church and all the women had to walk behind Virgin Mary and all the men had to walk behind Jesus Christ on separate streets until finally the mother and son met at the opposite side of the plaza (the one in front of the church). They played really sad music and then triumphant music at the end. I looked like I was chopping onions. The sensitive flower I am. 

A lot of the mass (or service?) was pretty boring even though I was paying attention, but it was worth going overall. Not looking foward to returning though XD. The whole thing looked very.. medieval/unmodern, wasn't delivered right, and was pretty useless to me. I THINK its called mass... those church events...or liturgy... I dont know.

UgyubCE5v9uHYLlqmct4AaABAg,Tom Sinclair,1524280491494,"Look at the narrative of Cain & Able.  Who really had ""the better"" sacrifice?  Who actually put the better effort in?  Able merely raised sheep, which is arguably much less labor intensive than growing crops, which is what Cain did.  And note, Cain was overcoming the curse of the ground that God placed on mankind.  So it's reasonable to look at the two, and to say, that Cain had the better sacrifice, as he worked harder at the task.  And yet, Able's was judged to be better.  

My point?  My point is, that most commenting here have no real grasp of what the Bible actually says, or is about.  Everything about that story is symbolic of a future sacrificed Jesus.  And that's why Able's ""inferior"" effort was chosen, because it was about the future sacrificed lamb.  

Same goes for the Abraham / Issac story - all about a future sacrificed Jesus.  And note, that human sacrifice (the shedding of innocent blood) to the ""gods"" was not a foreign concept in the ancient world.  The difference, is the Hebrew God did not allow it to conclude, whereas with the cultures across the world, it was (and is) commonplace.  And Jesus' eventual sacrifice was agreed upon by Jesus himself.  Contrast that picture with the image of the bound and fearful human surrounded by ""priests"" dressed in animal skins, scary costumes and masks, plunging a stone knife into the victim on a cold stone altar.

Although he has many good things to say on the nonsense of political correctness, Peterson is like ""the little foxes that ruin the vine"".  His underhanded opposition to the Bible will destroy him eventually, unless The Word converts him first.  

The Bible is clearly a supernatural, mystical and very brief text, but it is full of a power that destroys those who oppose it directly.  Those who disagree with it passively, are destroyed by their own refusal to deal with Jesus as Savior.  And yes, I get it, the idea that we need ""a Savior"" is foolishness - the Bible says as much.  And as dogmatic as Christians like to be, we all really have no idea about what is really going on.  We see through a glass darkly.

I will speak of a story passed down from Christian to Christian.  A Jordan Figure stands and holds a large crowd. As he systematically, and skillfully tares away at the christian faith and the cross of Christ.  An old man sits in the crowd listening while the speaker goes on.  As the end approaches the old Man raises up his hand to pose a question as he takes large bite out of an apple.  The Speaker turns and addresses the mans question.

Early Christians didn't acknowledge ""easter"" because its root is in the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. You know how Christ also said don't mix truth with leaven? Prime example. We celebrate the idea, the truth, that death ""passes over"" us on the Passover..free from the leaven of the eastern gate, sun deity, Ishtar. I know this will receive a million thumbs down, but if everyone promotes this elusive thing called truth, at least figure out what that truth is first. Dr. Peterson, Please explain why, once Christ had been executed and the entire play could've been over, that the disciples who witnessed first hand the accounts recorded went on to WILLFUL deaths of boiling cauldrons and head down, tormenting crucifixions and REFUSED to lie, and cry out that Christ had in fact, been an allegory for the divine, that he didn't resurrect? It would be easy, given the ""Heat"" on them, to recant. But they went head first into the demise of their earthly lives with joy.
I also used to rationalize the scriptures as some sort of ""self-help guide"" or metaphorically intended moral code, but taken as a whole, in context, that view is impossible, in my opinion. Its VERY precise, intended, and designed(admittedly by the very disciples of Christ, and by himself) to be the Truth, of one interpretation, and for one body of believers..Not to be stripped apart, added to and taken from. To do so negates its intent, fully.

I don't type paragraphs on these videos to be contentious, in any way. I love Peterson, and I love 99.9% of the people who hear his message, and I am one of those people. I just damn near mourn inwardly when he cheapens the resurrection of the Living Messiah, and convinces a great many to do the same."

My daily language is german. My mother-language is turkish. But you're right, it's very important for me not to look foolish in ONE comment, on one channel. I respect your answer. The Video that i mentioned was really bothering me. Maybe i had a bad day. There are many Peterson-criticising Videos. But this one just crossed my way and i found it to be just very unfair and dumb. The like/dislike proportion when i saw it in the morning was something about 4300 likes to about 1300 dislikes. Then i copy-pasted that comment of mine in about 85 channels about 90 times. Took me about 50 minutes. Was the first time i tried such a thing. 5 or 6 hours later the proportion was about 4800 likes to 4650 dislikes. Now it's 5326 to 5315. I promised Cult of Dusty a lot of attention. But rightful and negative attention. I kept my word. The people did it. I even got a new subscriber, altought i have never uploaded a Video till now. You're the only one that responsed a clear ""no"". I respect that. In the view of ""the world, the things, life, and everything"" it was just nothing. But i watched something happen that i initiated. And it felt great. From just my little view it was something huge, that i did the first time. Now i know what is possible with this, for me, very new thing named Internet/Youtube/andStuff. I kept my word. And not out of hate or something. I wanted to protect something. Not neccesarily Doc. Peterson. In just that moment i felt like i wanted to protect ... justness. But of course you're right. I will not do this again. I wasn't aware of the number of Anti-Peterson-Vids. Later that day i saw it. And of course Peterson isn't right about everything. But he tries his best in his own way, at least i feel and think so. It was great to experience that. I'm proud of myself to have done that. Thanks for your answer and your time.""

No answer. ('till now)

And in a new comment to Tyharo:

""So, in a way, i think i followed your advice. I fucked them. (?) :-))""

Tyharo answered back:

""It's not a popularity contest or something brother. Likes and dislikes don't mean anything. Fuck that shit too! ;-)
It just literally sucks your precious energy. And they don't deserve that energy. Save it for people that do matter, save it for yourself for example. Just remember to stand your ground, as an individual, if and when they attack you. That's the only thing prof. Peterson did too, he just stood his ground, that's all. That's how you will inspire other people, by being true to yourself, as an individual, first.
Others will ofcourse hate you, for the exact same reason. In fact..ALWAYS expect hate, sheeple really hate the individual. It scares the crap out of them. That's how you REALLY fuck with them. ;-)
Take great care of yourself brother, may the force be with you.""

And i answered:

""4.4.2018, 1Uhr03

And Tyharo again said:

""√ñzg√ºr Atmaca No problem at all man, thank YOU, I consider people like you worth my time and energy, always.""

Later Elise M wrote under the comment that John Smith had written:

""It was correct though. And dislike bombing someone's video because you disagree is pathetic.""

I responded:

""Maybe you're right. I think i explained elaborately enough why i did that, what i now think about it, and admitted that i just did that for this one time, and i'm not gonna do that again. I respect your opinion. Maybe the only point that you and John Smith are not getting on your side is, that a person with a wide range discredited someone else, whom i consider much more intelligent and anxious and honest then the first one. So, for me, causing this negative ""bombing"" was kind of fighting for the good. It's not only that a simply do not agree. If i would be so, i could make that with any Flat-Earther-Video or something like that. I disagree but still watch and get the views of the other side. It was this attack on a intellectual person, not so much through the 
content then much more just personally. Cult of Dusty was not just spreading a ""critical view"", what he did, (and as i said,  i wasn't aware how much this is going on, so NOW i see, that it was kind of 
senseless, but it still) was ratfucking/slander/calumny/character assassination. I don't know the things over there so well, but here in Germany this could be even considerd as a crime. If your best friend, or a professor who you respect or your child or your father would be trying to motivate people and express his/her opinion in metaphysical issues, and some guy would make a response like Cult of Dusty's, wouldn't you choose a side? Or let me ask simpler: So, if i had made a critics-Video about Cult of Dusty's analyse video, if i had made a response Video toward Cult of Dusty, then it would have been ok, right? Or would it then have been pathetic also? Would this have been the difference? Making a Video instead of initiating some Dislikes? How would i've been able to know, that there would be SUCH a reaction to MY reaction? Do you get what i mean? Or do just want to recognize me as a bad and evil and hateful and sad person, who has simply nothing else to do? If so, i'd ask myself what the hell i'm using so much words to explain myself.... did you even read what i wrote? So. What do you think? What are your answers? And by the way ... is that your real picture? If so, WOW, you're quite beautiful.""

No answer. ('till now)
...
...
So. Why did i wanted to tell you all about this little electronical adventure? Was thinking about it while i was putting this together. For attention? Yes of course. For ""virtue signaling""? I couldn't say, that it's not virtue signaling, yes. Because i'm a transhumanist who wants to share many things thats important for himself with some strangers? Yea, maybe, yes. To show you what a intelligent, patient and good guy i am so you all could caress my head? Surely, couldn't be else. Maybe it was that sensefull/senseless issue. If you would read this, maybe THEN it would get a sense. But wait, i already saw a sense in it, and explained that. Hmm ....

So, I'm sitting here and just wanted to have a quick look, if Elise M maybe had written a answer. And in that moment i thought about making this comment. I thought about that for maybe 2 minutes. Now i will do it. If someone finds it to be silly, well, maybe, then it is so. I will copy-paste some comments that i made through the last days. It's self explaining. I hope Dr. Peterson will read it. I hope, he will not respond anything. But i hope, i could get some opinions from the folks here in the comments. And if you ask: Why these 3 hopes? ... no idea. Just wanna do it. I'll think about it, while i do it. Let's begin. And by the way, the picture of my face is real.

I saw a Video from another Youtuber named ""Cult of Dusty - Jordan Peterson is a charlatan"". It made me mad. I wrote to him:

But i don't get, what this has to do with my little ""outrage"" towards Cult of Dusty. I'd say that was one of the very rare times that i made such a angry ""critic"", but only because of such a unfair and bad analysis. So,let me ask: What do you mean? What could i've done better?""

But if you come to the same conclusion as i've come in about the first minutes then i would wish that there will be produced a Wave of Tear-Apart-, destroy-, debunk- and so on Vids against that silly stuff!""

...and just did my things, was not longer thinking of that. Then, some hours later i saw what happend, laughed about 45 minutes and wrote to Cult of Dusty:

We would often break down a product/machine, not into it's physical parts, but rather it's Actions.

A bike kan be broken down into: Frame, seat, handles, pedals.
Those things are solutions to actions though: ""Holding everything together"", ""Place to sit/rest"", ""means of steering"", ""Means of propulsion""
Of course sometimes an object has more than one action it fulfills, the handles and pedals are also ""places to rest"" parts of your body etc.

This also becomes then an important factor that a bike-maker isn't making bikes. A Bike-maker is making ""means of transportation""."

From the title of the video I hoped that you would be addressing something very different than what you did. I hoped you would address your failure to provide a reasonable answer to those who ask you your opinion on the literal/physical death and resurrection of Jesus as interpreted within a materialistic worldview.

Your flailing about for a answer when Timothy Lott asked you this question was painful to watch. It's a reasonable question. It's a basic question. A reasonable person may expect a sane answer to it. You failed, miserably to give one. 

You may believe it's a less important question than what you discussed in this video, but now reasonable people can and do point to that fault and question your sanity and/or your honesty.

I think you're a brilliant man. I'm sure you can think of a rational response. I'm a lesser intellect and I can think of a few good responses. I don't buy that your delusional. I personally starting questioning your honesty at that point. Your answer was nothing less than a dodge like I have come to expect from the most dishonest politicians.

Don't lie to your audience like that again. You have an intelligent audience. When you try to manipulate us like that, we can tell. We'll stop trusting you. We'll be done with you. And then you will be done.

I prefer' ≈Ωi≈æek's interpretation line - that the core of Christianity is abstracted above the base level of rebirth by multiple levels. As you are aware Christian thought largely birthed the objective view. I think this is the big hint to its true essence -- That it had allowed such strong objective forces that overwhelmed itself. Now in the Christian Renascence that is the prime question as you started with -- how to integrate the objective. But you didn't finish with an answer.

The Romans and the Jews present did not speak Aramaic and believed he was calling on God to save him, which he was not. He was proclaiming to God that his destiny was being fulfilled, nit questioning why God put him on the cross.

While I‚Äôm not in agreement I must note that William James already covered this ground and I‚Äôm surprised by Peterson‚Äôs apparent ignorance of his writings on these very topics.  One cannot reconcile evolutionary psychological and social development and a created order.  The latest archaeology indicates that this present iteration of historic epoch first appeared fully formed and advanced some time around 12,000 years ago and has been devolving ever since.  The most obvious example of this is the clear witness of the Egyptian culture.  Like it or not, and with full recognition that entertaining this view will be done at the peril of no longer being considered an adult by academic peers this is a fact supported by empirical evidence which cannot be explained by the evolutionary paradigm.  

As Peterson himself points out, change comes when one is willing to sacrifice the security of ones personal world view in light of the facts.  An honest intellectual examines the facts and forms tentative conclusions loosely held on to.  The wise interrogator of nature is able to hold onto several competing theories and let‚Äôs them fight it out as new evidence is discovered.  If the evolutionary method itself is invalid in the realm of biology then why hold on to it in the realm of anthropology or psychology?  The true intellectual does not filter the facts through the prevailing world view to see which ones are supportive and which ones are inconvenient."

Work enters only after humans leave the ""paradise"" as a curse and punishment for their sin. Its interesting, i think this shows that this part of the bible speaks about an agrarian society, where you really had to work very hard to get by. One had to discipline oneself to work 24/7 on the fields. The concept of work enters human conscience, in that regard i dont think hunter-gatherers really ""work"" or worked. Work and sacrifice only  came about with ""civilization"" and population growth. Interestingly enough there is clearly a longing to go back to this state. The state of  paradise, the state of the eternal now in most utopias like communism and so on. The end of ""work"". The returning to ""home""."

UgyBFX0WKjYST-DHzKd4AaABAg,humanblip,1524280505965,"The fall changes the experience of work - not its meaning. Work becomes an experience of deep existential need when distanced from the experience of sharing God's life.

Man is from the beginning created to share with God - including sharing in God's work.

Both work and sacrifice stand within the framework of God's gifting*.

ie. work is not simply a result of the fall; and work only becomes sacrifice when it is also giving.

My experience is limited, but nothing brings me closer to the deepest nature of sacrifice than the trying to do what Jesus says and does. ""Love your enemies."" How do I that??!! The Father does it constantly and Jesus does what he sees his father doing.

Jesus in John 4: ""My food is doing the will of him who sent me and finishing the work he has given me.""

Jesus in Matthew 6: ""Look at the birds in the sky. They never sow nor reap nor store away in barns, and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't any of you much more valuable to him than they are?""

Jesus in Luke 6: ""No, you are to love your enemies and do good and lend without hope of return. Your reward will be wonderful and you will be sons of the most high. For he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked!""

You spoke of Isaac being used as a sacrifice by Abraham when he was a young child.  The Book of Jasher, chapter 22, verse 41, states that Isaac was 37 years old at the time.  The Book of Jasher has been mentioned on a  few occasions in the bible.  I think Isaac was a willing participant and understood the meaning of sacrifice.  

Jash 22:41 And when Isaac was thirty-seven years old, Ishmael his brother was going about with him in the tent.

Jash 22:42 And Ishmael boasted of himself to Isaac, saying, I was thirteen years old when the Lord spoke to my father to circumcise us, and I did according to the word of the Lord which he spoke to my father, and I gave my soul unto the Lord, and I did not transgress his word which he commanded my father.

Jash 22:43 And Isaac answered Ishmael, saying, Why dost thou boast to me about this, about a little bit of thy flesh which thou didst take from thy body, concerning which the Lord commanded thee?

Jash 22:44 As the Lord liveth, the God of my father Abraham, if the Lord should say unto my father, Take now thy son Isaac and bring him up an offering before me, I would not refrain but I would joyfully accede to it.

Jash 22:45 And the Lord heard the word that Isaac spoke to Ishmael, and it seemed good in the sight of the Lord, and he thought to try Abraham in this matter."

I still don't like the ""sacrifice"" terminology, because letting go of misconceptions is only an apparent sacrifice and never a real sacrifice. God does not ask sacrifice of anyone, and thinking so will tend to scare people into believe that God can be something other than loving and just. However, it does indeed often feel like a sacrifice, so contemplating about these things is obviously important. Suffice it to say, nothing essential within man will ever need to be given up. Only pushiness, insistence, trying to control others, misconceptions, arrogance, and other worthless traits must be given up to connect with God."

Throughout the old and new testaments we can see GOD'S favour of the shepherd, Abel, Moses, David, the shepherds at the birth of CHRIST, even JESUS himself tended the flocks as a child, is this because the nomadic community is less likely to become corrupt as compared to a large settled community such as a town or city.

Ugz0b9ybowIjt8pZLhF4AaABAg,GutsofEclipse,1524280515810,"I think that it's a natural conclusion that civilization would eventually work towards individual sovereignty and personal responsibility. The purpose of civilization is to make it as easy as possible for people to live. Letting someone else do all of the thinking and accept all of the responsibility might seem easier on the surface, but that's only until this one person does something stupid and/or malicious and nobody is allowed to mitigate the effects of his behavior on everybody else. As humanity gets intelligent and experienced enough to realize that large, centralized authorities with the power to jam their thumbs into every aspect of the lives of the people that they rule over doesn't result in making life easier for the people living under them,  such authorities will lose their footholds and have a very hard time reestablishing them.

I'm not necessarily saying that we'll reach that point this time, mind you. The idea of freedom from responsibility is alluring, and both the people who want the free meals and the people who benefit from promising said meals have the smoke machine running on full blast, trying to obscure the history of big government and choke out anyone who gets too close with assaults on their reputation and (these days, and probably more so in the coming years unless we can turn things around) possibly imprisonment."

I always (like many) thought my brand of Christianity to be the truest (i scale truth in that statement) that the "" once saved, always saved "" was a sinners reprieve who can never face or admit to their own shame. I did reconcile the fact that i am sure one can make a number of arguments to destroy my brand of it as well, so finding myself almost full circle at square one , i decided to follow the teachings of Christ directly and seek the truth.  Now my life is about seeking that truth in me, facing myself and seeking, serving others, and asking to receive""  i also find myself less interested in MSM, i read more, and i am walking toward truth, toward something, toward Christ in me.

UgzIR6c8Ml6BguoCL694AaABAg,Myles Davidson,1524280515901,"Is the 'Christ event' historical or mythological?

No-one can safely answer that question without first interacting with Richard Carriers phenomenal book On The Historicity Of Jesus: Why We May Have Reason To Doubt. I was skeptical of the mythicist position until I read this book. Carrier's brain is a massive database of information from that period of history and he brilliantly weaves a coherent explanation of why the Gospels (and the Book of Acts) are written as myth. This is the first peer reviewed tome relating to Jesus 'mythicism' and the gold standard by which all discussion about the subject must revolve.

I am hoping Peterson reads it one day and comments on it. It will vastly expand his understanding of how Christianity became the foundational story of Western Civilisation. I know many Christians are hoping he will eventually embrace the 'Christ story' as a historical event (I was once one of them until I read this book) but he would be remiss to go down that path without first reading this book.

I sincerely hope you have read this comment Mr. Peterson. I greatly appreciate your work and have been eagerly awaiting your analysis of the Christ story. Richard Carriers work will greatly aid you in your endeavour! :)"

Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment. The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, whether it wills it or not, is working, will be perfect harmony. It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because it had slaves, and starved them. It will be complete, and through it each man will attain to his perfection. The new Individualism is the new Hellenism"". -Oscar Wilde"

UgwEB0o70m92SJo8ovd4AaABAg,Chris c,1524280527997,"Jordan, what is your take on the Gnostic perspective of the genesis story? The idea being that the God who banished Adam and Eve is actually a faux god, the Demiurge, a warlord who is masquerading in the symbology of our human psyche as a true God, the All-Father, to perpetuate an alchemical process of synthesizing a self-sustaining mode of slavery, detached from the voice of our flesh and blood (the voice of our bodies and our biological heritage) and to gradually conform to a symbiosis with a septic foreign predator, that being society itself. The Snake, Lucifer (bringer of light), would be an archetype of Christ; the internal voice of the Self, an extension from the true loving God which encourages the Woman Eve (and there's significant reasons it would be the woman, particularly because she is the mother, the womb, the RECEIVER, where seeds would be received and life would come from) to regain knowledge of her existence. To regain the voice of her flesh and blood. But for this, she and her counterpart are punished into a lower level of existence below the Garden. The Snake is very much a predator, but a predator in the context that it is the antiseptic foe of the main predator who is masquerading as the god of humanity; the abrahamic god.

There are many stories that depict the symbolism of what I wrote here; most commonly movies like the Matrix; or more directly in association with Platos cave myth.

There seems an indication in world myths of an unholy sepsis rotting at the roots of what we call civilization, and you can see it if you look closely. Our world is a war. Our world is a military endeavor, whether it be in the classroom or at work, or between tribes of peoples. History is in part the story of our divorcement with our heritage and our bodies holy voice, with the replacement of a machine to organize ourselves for us, detached from the essential organs that make us Man and Woman and give us our voices as such. And I don't think it would be intellectually honest to wave this notion aside as merely pessimistic and/or an expression of the Cain archetype. Men and Women of today are certainly grappling hard, and arguably losing their sense of what makes them a Men and Women. You see it with the transgender issue bubbling up and growing. You see it in the classroom where many government schools are now teaching boys and girls that there is no such thing as a boy and girl. Mind you, they are teaching this to boys and girls in the name of civility, tolerance, and societal progression. When can we ever have an honest conversation about what society is ACTUALLY in the business of? I appreciate your attempt to return focus onto the positive aspects of society, but I'm disappointed that it seems, at least to me, to be leading us down a dead end road by disregarding the essential issues behind what makes society a cost negative as well.

I love your work and you have had a large impact on my life. But I would so love to hear you grapple with the depth of the Gnostic argument someday. And I imagine that this argument is not primarily Gnostic in origins, but is a school that I only know of that is a reflection of this thinking. I also understand though, why you may never entertain this telling of the story in public because it's not exactly something that you can sell. And it's in many ways antithetical to the narrative you have laid down thus far in your public career. It would get in the way of what you've already packaged for sale for people.

P.S. it makes me wonder though, why are so many intellectual giants such as yourself incapable or unwilling to take on the negatives of society. It almost reinforces the argument a bit in the sense that society, as a mass machine for voluntary and involuntary slavery, is just far too big and far too brutal and successful of a system to actually ridicule at this point. It is too big, it is too far gone, and the apocolypse has already happened. Sometimes the message that I'm hearing from you is that because it's too late, we must organize our minds and our lives in ways that will reduce struggling against it. That, the truth, is that we cannot take our lives and our bodies and our heritage back. It's gone. And we might as well get with the program however we can entertain ourselves to do so.

I'm not attacking you or anyone. This is merely a genuine concern that I wish people were capable and willing to take more seriously and talk more about. But again, if its true, I can understand why it will likely never be entertained. Because the state of slavery among mankind is already here. And who on Earth wants to admit to that? No one does.

Thank you, Dr. Jordan Peterson."

For one thing, the Bible teaches that Jesus died for our sins, and that sacrifice, believe it or not, is something that only Christ can accomplish. No matter how hard we try, we can't apply his sacrifice to our own lives, because if we could, Christ's sacrifice would not have been required to begin with. Contrary to what some people believe, being a Christian is not about making society better, although it does make society better. When you're a Christian, you have a relationship with Christ, the one true God, who loves humanity with every aspect of his being. Without that relationship, Christianity will not, cannot, and should not survive."

Ugw8lkP3Kma4164-vEt4AaABAg,Paxsali,1524280529989,"I don't see why we can't have both. Having to be pragmatic in terms of our actions and describing the world as it is. It seems to me you kinda assert without evidence or argument that whatever your description of the world is, it's ought to be filtered through and nested inside a pragmatic perspective. It is not sufficiently explained why that is or should be the case. You can play a thought experiment where you imagine you were a dog or a cat or a bird. If what you say is true, then for each experience (or nature of being) dog, cat and bird, your description of the world must necessarily be different, namely the one that is pragmatic in it's respective species. That scenario is absurd, because it is perfectly plausible (from an external viewer) to accept that all three different beings live in fact in one and the same world, concurrently and independently of each other. But, due their different nature, they ought to subordinate their description of the real world (or simply truth) to their specific (and each has a different) pragmatic behavior. The dog would have to describe the universe in terms of what he values or not, say catching ball and going for walks. The cat would have to describe the very same universe in a different manner for the same reasons, which leads to an unnecessary contradiction or inconsistency, and the same with the bird. It seems to me you are incapable to make such distinction between how are actions ought to be and how the world (or truth) is. Either that, or you see some implications in how we should behave, because of that distinction, that wouldn't agree with, but it's not self-apparent to me what such objection would be. In both cases I compare this unability of yours (or unwillingness) to the inability of little children, who have not yet developed the theory of mind. Things are actually pretty simple and straight forward, if you don't assert the world ought or can only to be described through a lense of pragmatic behavior, even if other people may or may not agree with the proposed behavior or morality. The very fact that there are plenty of people who are willing to cecede the action/morality part, but don't accept the other part about describing the world or what is truth should be a hint that the two may not be unnecessarily entangled together, and if they must be, then at least justify it sufficiently."
