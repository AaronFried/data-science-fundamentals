I described him to my atheist friends as a Christian without Christ who lacked real sustainable vitality outside the illusion of meaning. It’s following a reflection and missing the object reflected. In the end it is a system of ‘works’ where ultimately we discover, yet again, our inadequacy. All those young men are in for some disappointment."
UgywDQJQSEab3riZl8t4AaABAg,Vance Crofoot,1534561207491,"Here is one of one of Jordan's direct quotes from an interview with Sam Harris: “I think that religious systems are descriptions of how people ought to act” 
Really? The bible condones slavery, human sacrifice, genocide, the beating of children and the subjugation of women .. In addition, religion has been responsible for more death, war and destruction than any other man made fallacy. If you disagree google priests and pedophilia, the crusades, the inquisition, suicide bombings, etc. 
Lastly, the safest most crime free countries on the planet are secular and nonreligious while the most religious countries are home to the most crime, violence, rape, homelessness, murder etc.

Jordan finds this confusing, but it's actually explanatory when premised that the creator knows His creations.

I'm currently fighting with my father about politics and recently, in counseling, I began exploring the concept that I perhaps form certain beliefs to protect myself from realities that I am not equipped to process yet without a great muddying of my waters. I was both in awe to think that there might be a higher part of myself using the the conscious part that I typically refer to as ""me"" to protect me, as well as appalled to think that some, if not all, of my beliefs are merely devices to avoid pain. Am I so shallow? Do these things I call ethics account for anything in my behavioral cognition? And maybe it's not so much a mystery why when these... insulating?... beliefs are challenged I/people feel personally attacked. What else would you call an elimination of protection?"

UgyYhJjdJJtKP_tWTOd4AaABAg,Reese Archer,1534474808842,"Everyone has different pain thresholds. His dispute with post modernism is biased to his own experience. Yes, pain is a fundamental belief but the post modernists are still actually right because every experience of pain is different.
What we actually should aim for in a post modern world is logical consistency and complementarity between experiences. Each experience will have its own absolute truth and interpretation which will be slightly different from the others.
There really is no chaos or interpretation overload per experience. There is an infinity of experiences but each experience has its own interpretation. There wont be an absolute or proper way of being for all experiences but rather there will naturally be a quantized way of being per experience.
Meaning will exist in every experience. But it will exist as unique to the experience. Each experience is distinct. There cant be 1 meaning to life.
Peterson is a liberal traditionalist which i can appreciate however his approach puts relativity and plurality second when actually his monistic, singular view of the world should be placed second, as more of an approximation of the multiplicity, per se."

The Brother's Karamazov used to be my favorite novel of all time and I say it kept me from Atheism. Then I read Crime and Punishmeny and was blown away. It's like he foresaw the entire 20th century the way Nietzsche did. I've always thought, as Peterson says, that Atheists havent truly contended with Dostoevsky because his logic is flawless and it is. I suspect most Atheists havent ever read Dostoyevsky. They read a couple Dawkins books and they think that makes em smart."
UgzVd__mxcfVcGB5DpF4AaABAg,GraphiteBlimp,1534215609831,"44:20 This is the moment where I don't necessarily disagree with Jordan, I just think that what we do instead of religion could be better than the Bible ever could be.  He's right, we won't instantly become rationalists if we removed religion, but we could get to a place where we could freely pursue a rational ""meaning/purpose of humans"" (IMO to explore the universe, to create wonders by purposely organizing the universe in a way it could not act out itself, and to spread love wherever we go).  We could probe different possibilities for what I'll call spirituality via psychedelics, meditation, rational argument, and philosophizing.  Religion is not necessary and we should not embrace anything that does not have evidence.  Love the video, Jordan has a way with making stories sound monumental, and even from a ""hardcore"" atheist, I can appreciate aspects of the Bible from a secular point of view.  I just don't hold Jordan's definition of ""truth"" at the same value of the ""What is in accordance with reality"" one."
UgyHOhtKO79UZ4qZ3dh4AaABAg,Jay Skeetor,1534215609838,"The way he describes the utility of dreaming makes me think of defragmenting a hard drive.   The ""sanity"" of the computer must be maintained by order.  Missing portions must be filled.  The difference between the human mind and the computer defragmenting is that the human mind can fill in some of the ""gaps / confounding situations of the day"" whereas the computer can not.  The computer simply defragments for the utility of space consolidation and speed of information recovery.  Both of which are true for the human mind, but missing from the computer which does not solve the problems of the day.   Interestingly enough our brains are a very complex computer, but also one that takes in everything of the day and attempts to help us make sense out of all of it by consolidation / human defragmenting while at the same time attempting to solve unsolved problems we may have encountered throughout our day.  We are very complex."

I like him but I have my own knowledge and experiences. He will never solve the worlds problems. Debates are a waste of time. IF you want to change the world quicky and efficietly (change every different person to your liking) For example:  Invade and nuclear bomb most major cities in America. Russia invade the east and China invade the west. All Commerce will stop. When Americans starve and can't get food and water and their suffering; they will all change rather quickly. Most will starve to death. All his talk goes out the window. Nuclear War and invasion is the only way to change people (quickly and efficiently).. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK  HEADS!!!"

Poking axioms isn't enough! We don't need to create values, we just have to listen to our feelings! If you don't have feelings, you're just pathological psychopath! Transparency outta attainable by transcendent meditation! We have history to reference against! I know what we are! Jordan, you should look up the origins of those passages of the old testament! You don't need drugs! That's a fallacy! It's a misguidance!!! Drugs are bullshit! Overrated!!! Freud? Jung was his student and is an evolution but also an addition! Dream state is not beyond understanding of rationality or thoughts. It's never fully formulated nor articulated!!! Neither is consciousness! That's why there IS belief! Because of uncertainty, this paradoxical state, that we call spirituality. Uniting happens because of the association process that happens in our hard wired minds! There is nothing what even resembles god, nor the idea of a god, not even the fallacy of thousands of years of religious history validates any projections humans make about their dreams. See the conflict of interest here?!? Nazis? Soviets? Try American MKultra! Do you really believe that there's no understanding of the human mind??? Really!? What about social engineering?!? No? Art? Music? You really think there's no intended purpose? It's just nourishing but we don't know what we create? Or why? How about bineural beats then?!? Behaviorist analysis is just an observation of abstraction within your defined and limited reality so it's not a viable tool for describing the true reality! Just an aspect of the greater spectrum! How do we live in the world? QUOTE; ""God only seems to know how"" that's a fallacy right there!!!!! You refer to implied understanding from a concept of an illusion of an omniscient consciousness!!!!! Come on Jordan!!! QUOTE, ""god only knows where you got it"" It's ironic that you're reffering to god while speaking about dogmatic psychological pathology!!!! Law is different from religious belief systems, it's just an evolved concept of psychological dominance and control over human spirit. Hierarchy again??? Fallacy in itself!!! Not viable as an explanation for a devine principle, you say it yourself, so why you refer to (correction; it's not mythological)  SUMERIAN Marduk, that has not many names, the truth is that MARDUK usurped ALL other names and gods!!! Centered around himself. Tiamat was the water planet that collided with earth at the beginning of the world, what MARDUK did was atribute it all to himself!!!!!! So it's quite NORMAL that people and historians become confused!!!! Cut MARDUK out of the picture!!! Because it is him who confounds our understanding of the truth!!!! He was the first to pervert reality!!!! The truth!!! Thus every conclusion you base upon this paradigm is in situ a FALLACY. It's just like modern history; it's the victors who wrote it!!!!!!! Enough!!! I had respect for you, but I cannot possibly concur with your conclusions!!! We react as animals??? Never heard about the medulla oblongata?!? I hope you try and contact me if you want to come to the bottom of things. Always open for intelligent two way communication.

And it doesn‘t impress anyone capable of following the complex chain of words. Admittedly it will impress a large number of people simply because they can‘t follow. Just follow the, nevertheless, interesting thought on us not really grasping significant portions of objective reality. It gets lost in illogical concatenations of words. So, complex thoughts need processing in order to transport well and be logical at the same time. „people can know things at one level without being able to speak about it at another level“. Really knowing a subject enables a very simple, coherent and enlightning transport of this subject to the minds of ordinary people.

„It is an emotional dream that we are embedded in“ „what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don‘t really understand“ ff. oh my does this make sense to the originator in hindsight?

(John 1: 1-14)
The Word Became Flesh 

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome[a] it.

6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— 13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.

14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."

UgxrUvkfzk5gy14KyoN4AaABAg,david fenton,1533610812266,"Consciousness grows and develops from experience of reality. 
To examine this, just list all the conscious thoughts you can have without prior sense experience. 
(Actually do that, i.e. list all the conscious thoughts you can have without prior sense experience.)
IF there are none, (and I have not yet had anyone give me even one)
THEN sense experience is the means by which we become conscious
AND consciousness is a building up of, 'that which is' or 'the self existent' inside us. 
OR in other words consciousness is part of that in which we live and move and have our being (the unknown god of Paul in acts) inside us, and the more our consciousness aligns to 'the self existent/Yahweh/God' the more functionally or optimally we may live. 

The laws and ways of reality are what we live in, and the more we know or become conscious of these, the more we are able to live optimally and vice versa. 

We live in a time where a statist or secular indoctrination separates people from grounding reality by teaching Ideas and Concepts in place of true knowledge. To have a society that lives in good conscience it is a pre-requisite that each individual be conscious through direct individual use of their own senses so as to self inform concerning 'that which is' so as to live in and promote living in true consciousness/knowledge."
UgwivQgJBMArRywgsgh4AaABAg,david fenton,1533610812274,"Numbers are not true except as mere mental concepts, i.e. they do not exist except as Ideas. 
Only reality, that which is, is true. 
A conceptual image is never the base reality. 

Numbers can be useful, and even an interesting abstraction. For example an exact and finite nature of reality can be demonstrated by the use of a number representation of matter as follows: 

Each bit of matter has an exact mass. 
All of these that exist can be represented by a number and added to an exact amount. 
Therefore all the matter of reality is a finite and exact amount, no more and no less. 
(Note: Even though the above is logically correct, It is not of much practical use except for correcting people's conception of physical reality as immeasurable or infinite. Note: a child is capable of coming up with the above points, it is not complicated.

To me Jordan's Idea that numbers could be more real than the underlying reality they are conceptualised from is like much of religion and societal belief i.e. backwards or upside down to the actuality. 

Note: It is my opinion that mathematical abstractions are taught at a young age for the express purpose of promoting a belief in children that abstractions about reality are more reliable and valid than the real thing. i.e. it us used to as a wedge, separating the sensible, in contact with reality mind, from it's grounding contact with truth. Note: the educational, Addresses to the German Nation by Fichte (this is a foundation of modern education), highlights the use of physical shapes as representative of triangles, squares etc as real, while they are only Idealistically real artificial constructs i.e. it fashions the mind to believe in Idealistic objects from a very young age and this, I think is a great part of the separation of our consciousness from base reality and why many experience the type of confusion well illustrated by Jordan."

I respect your searching and deep thinking, and have been slowly learning of your perspective on the point of this life, being more than just evolution. 
But I wonder how you faced the problem of suffering as evidence for Atheism. You imply that humans have the power to take responsibility for the evil in this world and not use it as evidence for the lack of a loving God.  If there is a 'God and Evil' - How can man correct the 'evil' that is in nature ?  I only have to watch unedited video of for example Hyenas eating their prey alive a few times, and it sadly dawns on me, that I am coming to the realisation that there is no loving personal God, or evil, that evolution is not good or evil - just efficient. And we alone need to take responsibility for making this world a better place.  Or do you have an answer for this? Cliff

Ugw1xKr2K8Upm0lI_eF4AaABAg,Devious,1533006017393,"Here is the truth of the universal moral code that we as humans have progressed and changed over our existence: The universe is a land of moral neutrality. Good and evil does not exist. Being polite or thankful in universal moral standards is not good or evil. Any and every action, thought, life, or thing is neutral moral nothingness. There is no good and there is no bad.  Thus, the human conception of good and evil is well meaningless because it does not exist. This perception of good and evil that we as humans have created began from the development of emotional intelligence in our brains. From the development of this type of intelligence to now, we, as a collective group of intelligence life forms, have created our own moral code. This code is not truth, but rather based on emotions and experiences throughout our evolution. This collective moral code has guided us for centuries and now is argued by many to be a natural part of universe. Meaning this code that we created has existed since the beginning of time. The notion that our experiences brings us truth and meaning (universal code) is ridiculous because rather we develop our individual perception of the world through experience. When we collectively share perceptions on a subject, humans proclaim this to be somehow true because we all agree and no one will disagree. Then anyone who disagrees is “away from the truth” and is an outsider. 
Although not a natural part of life, humanly created moral codes are a necessity. One, they bring together people into a collective perception of the world. Two, they give meaning to this collective group. Three, they make people responsible for their actions. The universe does not have a manual, code, or law. This allows us to create our own meaning, which brings us everlasting freedom. 

I am not against the idea that a God exists, but the idea that this God has created a universal code is insane."

Freud wasn't all that original, nor was Jung: other psychiatrists were aware of the subconscious and hypnotists were common entertainment. But these psychoanalysts  spelled out their theories in a way laypersons could understand .Freuds's personal, unprovable position was that sex played the major part in the dynamics of creativity  and  we  were all involved in a continuous battle against repressed biological urges.

I feel we are becoming more and more divided, and still need a change for the good. We need morals to come back into our country in a strong way to fix a heap of major issues in our land. I hoped that someone would step up, that is against the current system, but no one has as of yet. I have created a plan to start a truly grass roots campaign for the next presidential election. I need all the social media's help on this. Here is a link to my crazy plan:

But the influence of the bible is not mystical, although all belief systems may have what is good as a mystical effect on the mind. If you've heard of 4th century emperor Constantine you can easily understand the influence of the Catholic church: it became Rome, you know, as in Roman Catholic church. Roman system of laws were adopted, with a Catholic, Christian twist and Western law, common or otherwise, reflected bible values and norms ever since. Progressive legislation against the basically racist, sexist, homophobic and unjust elements ( as in justification of slavery)  were very gradually implemented by the unrelenting efforts of  un - enslavable  minds, of which there are not nearly enough.  The bible and its stories were not all original and the ancient Mesopotamian Zoroastrian laws of Hammurabi are remarkably similar, but we don't normally give such credit  - too confusing. 
The ancient writers such as Homer , Virgil and philosophers, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle contributed to our ""frame of reference"" both conscious and subconscious as well. BTW, some  believe ancient Greek ideas of democracy were based on ancient Egyptian culture, and Western, New World democracy, was influenced by indigenous cultures. 
Marx did not intend nor in fact create an all-embracing system of values based on materialism or touted ""materialistic values"". He was interested solely in the concept of ""added value"", or the blood and sweat of workers added to matter that gave it the value expropriated by the  owners of industry, with little consideration of workers' right to the finer things in life, or even subsistence.  His animus against religion was that it rationalized human suffering as good and a means of salvation, with the focus on justice  diverted to the ""next"" life. He appreciated that human beings did not ""live by bread alone"", but also that without bread they were unlikely to write fine poems and compose music, or even behave very well.  Makes sense to me."

(This contrasts with Eve, who was created from one of Adam's ribs: Genesis 2:22.) The legend developed extensively during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadah, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism.[2] For example, in the 13th-century writings of Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she had coupled with the archangel Samael.[3] - Source  Wikipedia"

Jordan Peterson should strive to understand what it is all about. Much of what he says in other videos is admirable, but in this one he starts well, then goes off course when he strays into textual assumptions and is betrayed a mistranslation from Greek into English. But hauls himself back on course via Crime & Punishment, but then is betrayed by dogma that is not Biblical. But, as always, fascinating. The correct translation of John 1:1, as shown in the New English Bible (published by Oxford and Cambridge), is: 'In the beginning of creation was the Word, and the Word was with God, and what God was the Word was.' Then the last phrase fits the 'with' of the second, and fits all the places where Jesus Christ is seen and declared to be separate from God--standing beside his throne, for instance, proclaimed by God to be his Son at his baptism, for instance. And fits the rest of John 1. But 'state of being' is right on course: 'You must be born again.' Well struggled!"

Ugwn_mZLZFJUg3Aw3s94AaABAg,Vertical Urban Vegetarian Gardener's VLOG POSTS,1532142029925,"Behaviour was the impetus that wrote the ""carte blanche"" .. ""blank checque"", as Germany was facing the ""hidden internal demons"" which were bringing fear and panic among frontline soldiers, in the Battlefield Trenches in WWI.  The German Soldiers were not the only ones that were experiencing the fear and panic while fighting a Trench War.  Psychology and use of drugs to exact the one result to bring soldiers to ""feel numb without terror, without trauma, staying at their position to fight and continue killing enemy with rifle and bayonet successfully for as long as they could keep the fight going.. BUT, soldiers in the trenches were not facing the enemies that were assailing them with bullets or with bayonets, because the internal war was being too harsh for them  in  these  very  horrendous times and conditions of war.  The means that were developed for dealing with the
psychological internal war of heart and mind in the WWI German soldiers was to recapture those who ran off from the battle
or disobeyed direct commands and subject them to methods that were experimental and abusive.  The disobedient soldier
would have froze due to fear and the way to deal with individual expression of fear in battle was often to kill the one soldier
that would cause the action of inaction to be something the other soldiers would not dare think is possible.  Drugs were used
to change behaviour of soldiers beginning in Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany during the Great War: 1914 to 1918.  A major causal
factor in 1918 to bring the fighting to a grinding halt, was that Spanish Flu was spreading globally, but though this Influenza 
was killing a great many soldiers, it was brought home to so many populations, this was not widely-reported as the Army Medical Staff were quelling and silencing the rumours.  Letters from soldiers were not sent with more than a modicum of the true severity of the deadly spread of disease and letters were always being carefully censored during any Army Action during Training or during Deployment in time of war or peace.  The resolute end of drug and psychological mind games with German soldiers that started to go so pervasive throughout all national medical services everafter that incubator-era, was that soldiers in any country were not permitted free choice to disregard the order to visit the Medical Unit and to discuss fears or behaviours and ALL THE WORLD was a brand new stage.  A DRAMA would ensue during the 114 years up to the present day, and a plan was put into application with the psychology guru writings to be put to a proving-ground.  Our use of Chemical Treatments for what is most questionable, whether or not Mental Illness can be abated and constructive behavioural manipulation can be brought about as the psychotic episodes that anyone would deem to be most abusive and horrific, if a member of the family were to act out as a ""sicko"" or ""psycho"" or ""weirdo.""  Many times rampages in communities are carried out as a gunman goes murdering innocent young students and anyone-else.  If a commonality is sought for why these ultra-evil actions are getting less rare, I say there can not be one common denominator, the excuse for wiping-out your school friends, of such there is not a common thread, nor a common touchstone.  I often have questioned of my own self, as I am a Lutheran, but I am less-active now, but I see that Christian armies are fighting over in the Middle East, and Palestine is a position of great tumult where killings happen so inconspicuously, at least, this is how it seems as I catch the happenings in World News broadcasts.  CNN and many such organs of sensationalized news reels, show violence to such a degree and every news story is another nail in our ""civilisation's coffin.""
So, it makes one think, how true, how prevalent are acts of violence and abuses and kidnappings and killings and is there no good in people?  My view is YES good is to be found.  It is in us all.  We must seek first the Kingdom of God, and His Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto our lives.  Holy Scriptures - Matthew Ch. 6: verses 33, 34
verse 34 in the King James 1611 Authorised English Version is so plain in words we are capable to read and take to heart.  would we let such a simplified truth slip through the grasp of our hands?

verse 34 in Saint Matthew's Gospel (KJV) states Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.  
Explained in this way: thinking and planning and worry beyond what we need to get done today will be causing too much stress and we often think that people think and know us in the worst ways.  What others may  be thinking about us is really not our business to get to struggle with.  People do most often skip or say no if asked to answer two or three questions after they get some business done in a phone conversation.  So, The Things of The Morrow, meaning any future things are so often subjective and they cause us to deliberate over things that may or may not ever come to fruition.  The best example I know of such thought is when The Sears Christmas Wishbook Catalogues had been delivered to every doorstep, and in our home my younger brother and I would dream about what gifts we would ask for .. and sometimes we did our gift dreaming together.  Such times were the best fun.  We heard stories about other useful things the catalogue pages were saved for.  The 1929 stock market crash on Friday, March 29, was the day my Grampa, Steve Tokar, had been killed in a work accident.  My Dad was old-enough to put it together, he was not quite age three, but he said, no chocolate bars anymore.  Peter W. Tokar was my Dad.  I am Peter D. Tokar.  The hunt for stories that are full of meaning, has brought my understanding far flung across a galaxy of hopes and dreams and in to a most real understanding that all life-experiences are shaping who I am becoming.  My internal questioner, realizing that my life has turned-out to be so much nicer and better than I could ever have predicted.  It is my deep regret that people are suffering and being put to torture and death for being faithful Christians.  Journalists continue to be rounded up and demands are made that they work according to a position favouring the ones who claim authority and power.  The Great Depression from March 29, 1929 until the second world war had placed every nation on an economy to build for war, even the United States of America, though by profession and public view to be a neutral country, they were helping the British by sending convoys across the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1941, Sunday, December 7, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, had hit when many Military American families were in Churches at eight o'clock that morning (Local Time, Hawaii)
There was no other way out now, the American and Japanese diplomacy had ceased to keep a untenuous peace together.  
Canada and many nations were in a convulsive revolt against the AXIS RISE and THREAT to world democracy, ever since there had been German troops and materiel seiging the walls of Warsaw in Poland.  September 3, 1939, was the starting date.  Britain declared war on Germany right on call.  Canada declared war on Germany also at that Sovereign show of solidarity with our Polish sisters and brothers.  The use of psychology and sociology as tools to cause men and women to put peace-time life on hold so that war could be waged to bring Death to Enemy of the Democratically-elected Elite who were observing from home that the Tyrrant Hitler had gotten too big and too daring to be let to fight and take the whole of Europe within the tentacles sprouting from the vortex-power-cells that were an outgrowth of the Hitler Regime which spread over Europe which was ripe to be made over as a chunky stew by the Elitist German Third Reich.  The German Fourth Reich is alive and occupying the secret Deep Underground security domains in United States of America.  United Europe is also under the German Fourth Reich.  China and Russia are fully-equipping as Utilitarian Armed Regents to conquer and hold control over the world.  United Nations has become ineffective.  The Former United States American President Eisenhower had fortold that our world does not belong to human destiny.  We are living on a Prison Planet.  Anything we attempt to make life safer for ourselves becomes a part of the Future Extinction we face.
        We easily laugh at people who speak or write about conspiracy theories.  It is not theory.  It is Doctrine for control of the masses of populations worldwide.  Hitler's solution was to gas his self-proclaimed ""vermine""  and that happened so smoothly.  And there will never be an end to such solutions.  When one person is living, having killed or ended the lives of every other living soul, the last switch to be turned off, will be by suicide.  Get a grip people?"

Once understood, it has no contradictions. And, once one looks, there are tons of archaeological finds that without doubt support and prove the reality of what happened in that book.

For me, these are very difficult ideas to conceptualize let alone manifest. I find it miraculous that someone living in old testament time and place would be able to obtain this wisdom. Maybe I'm confused historically? 

In my mind I can think of two possibilities. Either we lost something when we became modern people, something that allowed us to view the world more clearly, or this is wisdom passed on to us from an advanced culture.

Take a deep study into Chuck Missler's materials on the Bible because Jordan you will be able to extract the data with more clarity and form better perspective using that source. I do not dismiss Jordan's material any more than I dismiss myself when thinking about my state of mind when I was younger and before my mental modeling reached certain conclusions about life - see that's just it, that is life. On that note, I wish him well in his growth and I can say the same of him, Jordan Peterson, as I can say about anyone and including myself - that I very much hope he finds his way, discovers truth and finds the joy of life.

The Logical creation of our world belongs to Logos [Gr. w. meaning Word, Logic, Reason, Ratio/Fraction], We thus move on to a new chapter, in order to analyze this Logos of the Second Mind/Creator. But if take into account that this Second Creator Mind (God) “always geometrizes” then we must consider His Logos (Word) as a fraction:

LogosLogos/fraction = Division, fission, splitting.
Ancient Greek has always been a code, where every symbol/letter, even every word, hides encoded messages. Thus, as the word Theos [Gr. ‘Θεός’] begins with the symbolic letter Theta [Θ] which is the symbol of our world, like a circle/egg [O] which contains the divine seed inside [ʘ], likewise the first letter [Λ] of the word  Λόγος [Gr. for Logos], with its shape, precisely denotes this fission/splitting, with the creation of the two legs (Λ) of Lambda, forming the shape of a wave/oscillation (Λ). If we look at the English ‘Word’ = Λόγος, we will still find the symbol of oscillation in its first Letter (W).

God’s Logos therefore, denotes the creation of fission (duality/dyadicism), which prevail in our world.
Duality/dyadicism is comprised of its two poles: The positive and the negative one.
The two legs of  [Λ] correspond to these two positions, which alternatively symbolize “good” an “evil” of our world.

Between the two limbs/poles of Λόγος, Oscillation manifests, which tries to unite one extreme (+) with the other (-) causing interchange. Thus, oscillation becomes the predominant principle of our world.

PLATO’S TIMAEUS (XIX 52d4-53):
«And the nurse of creation, which is moistened and ignited/incandesced and receives the forms of earth and air, submits to all the subsequent effects and changes they undergo, so that she presents a variety of appearances as a result; …Oscillating though irregularly in all directions, she sways unevenly hither and thither, by the forces/forms that are inside her, and by her motion again she shakes them; and the elements when moved some one way, some another, are separated just as wheat when it is threshed.»
Scientists today have discovered that everything oscillates. From light, which is characterized as an oscillation of an electric and magnetic field, the atom’s electrons [Louis de Broglie (1892-1987)] , all the way to neutrinos. After all, the Quantum String Theory considers the fundamental elements of the universe to be strings and not particles. These free strings vibrate (oscillate). Different vibrational modes of these strings produce (represent) the various types of Particles.

Besides matter, human emotions also oscillate between pleasant and unpleasant emotional states. After all, breath [Gr. ανάσα = breath (Gr.: άνασσα = queen –the queen of needs] is an oscillation, which has its positive part in inhalation and its negative in exhalation.

Oscillation is symbolized by the snake because its natural movement is clearly a wavy oscillation.
The snake is a symbol found primarily in the Christian Religion and is equated to Lucifer.

Therefore: snake = Lucifer
Hence we conclude that the Word of God (Λόγος/Logos) gives initially birth to the oscillation of this world and is identified with Lucifer."

However, I believe the Infinite Source behind creation (or in more scientific terms, the infinite space-time Singularity where the Big Bang came from) is not only creating bottom-up out of nothing as dead matter, but also top-down as the awareness within nature. For absolute nothingness to be more than absolutely nothing all it can do is conceive ""The Infinite"", but for the ""The Infinite"" to be anything less than infinite it can only behold itself in the context of its own expressiveness that is less than infinite. This, I would say, is the precondition of the evolution of consciousness. I go into more detail about this in my youtube videos."

16:6.4 There exists in all personality associations of the cosmic mind a quality which might be denominated the “reality response.” It is this universal cosmic endowment of will creatures which saves them from becoming helpless victims of the implied a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion. This reality sensitivity of the cosmic mind responds to certain phases of reality just as energy-material responds to gravity. It would be still more correct to say that these supermaterial realities so respond to the mind of the cosmos.

16:6.5 The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are:

1. Causation—the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination.
2. Duty—the reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination.
3. Worship—the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, the recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination.

16:6.9 These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, these cosmic responses, are innate in the cosmic mind, which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self-consciousness of reflective thinking. But it is sad to record that so few persons on Urantia take delight in cultivating these qualities of courageous and independent cosmic thinking.

16:6.10 In the local universe mind bestowals, these three insights of the cosmic mind constitute the a priori assumptions which make it possible for man to function as a rational and self-conscious personality in the realms of science, philosophy, and religion. Stated otherwise, the recognition of the reality of these three manifestations of the Infinite is by a cosmic technique of self-revelation. Matter-energy is recognized by the mathematical logic of the senses; mind-reason intuitively knows its moral duty; spirit-faith (worship) is the religion of the reality of spiritual experience. These three basic factors in reflective thinking may be unified and co-ordinated in personality development, or they may become disproportionate and virtually unrelated in their respective functions. But when they become unified, they produce a strong character consisting in the correlation of a factual science, a moral philosophy, and a genuine religious experience. And it is these three cosmic intuitions that give objective validity, reality, to man’s experience in and with things, meanings, and values.

16:6.11 It is the purpose of education to develop and sharpen these innate endowments of the human mind; of civilization to express them; of life experience to realize them; of religion to ennoble them; and of personality to unify them."

102:0.1 TO THE UNBELIEVING materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man’s only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.

102:0.2 But such is not man’s end and eternal destiny; such a vision is but the cry of despair uttered by some wandering soul who has become lost in spiritual darkness, and who bravely struggles on in the face of the mechanistic sophistries of a material philosophy, blinded by the confusion and distortion of a complex learning. And all this doom of darkness and all this destiny of despair are forever dispelled by one brave stretch of faith on the part of the most humble and unlearned of God’s children on earth.

102:0.3 This saving faith has its birth in the human heart when the moral consciousness of man realizes that human values may be translated in mortal experience from the material to the spiritual, from the human to the divine, from time to eternity"

The good thing about knowledge of our CREATOR is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
Everything in creation testifies to our CREATOR as the author and owner of HIS creation. Reality is a miracle. Life is a miracle.
Reality is a miracle that needs no substitute by fantasy. Never worship the creation only our CREATOR."

I've seen the good effect religion can have on the lives of people and have enjoyed all the great classical music and art inspired by religion, but my thoughts on the negative aspects (which the ""new atheists"" attribute to religion) started to weigh more on my moral scales as I grew older.

I've had experiences which I would call spiritual when listening and singing religious (oddly enough) music and also on psychedelics. I have never practiced or studied religion in any way though, and always thought religion to be a silly historical remnant with nothing special to offer me. Thank god Jordan Peterson has opened my eyes on the subject! I'm baffeled how Sam Harris and the likes seem to disregard Peterson's insight the same way they disregard the creationist attempts to fight the ""new atheist"" arguments. I wonder if there's some intellectual jealousy involved...

Ugzbu0JZxU_xi7XgwSp4AaABAg,Cyber Auteur,1529550043151,"Une première idée synthèse de cette conférence : « L’histoire de Marduk montre que s’il y a des choses qui vous inquiètent,
que des monstres serpentins et chaotiques du monde sous terrain vous menacent,
le mieux est d’ouvrir les yeux et d’organiser ses paroles, d’aller confronter la chose, et de créer le monde à partir de cela.
C’est incroyable que quand j’ai commencé à lire et à comprendre cette histoire, à quel point j’ai été époustouflé par la profondeur cette idée,
et on sait qu’elle est vraie car on peut vérifier en psychothérapie par exemple qu’il vaut vraiment mieux confronter ses peurs directement
plutôt que d’attendre et de les laisser vous trouver,
et donc une partie du travail du psychothérapeute est d’aider les gens à découper leurs peurs en petits morceaux puis à les confronter une par une.
Donc on enseigne ce processus éternel de maîtrise d’un monde étrange et chaotique,
donc tout ça constitue une partie du contexte, on n’est même pas encore arrivé à la première ligne des récits Bibliques mais...
tout ça forme le contexte, il faut voir que l’on a extrait ces histoires, ces étranges recueils d’histoires avec toutes leurs erreurs, ses répétitions, ses bizarreries,
depuis que nous sommes capables de collecter des idées c’est le mieux que nous ayons été capables de faire.
Je sais qu’il y a d’autres traditions religieuses, je ne m’en préoccupe pas pour l’instant car on peut utiliser celle-ci comme exemple,
mais en tout cas c’est le mieux dont nous avons été capables, et j’espère
que nous pourrons nous tourner à nouveau vers ces récits avec l’esprit ouvert pour voir s’il y a quelque chose qui pourrait nous être utiles,
et j’espère que ça sera le cas, comme je l’ai dis j’approche cela aussi rationnellement que possible.» Mon enthousiasme pour cette conférence m'encourage à offrir un petit tour de synthèse. Je vous reviens pour les francophones que cela intéressent... Cyberauteur(com)"

The narrative of the Bible, which has stood the test of time, still holds up as a compelling narrative of how we do find meaning despite suffering.

I tried to empathize with someone suicidal, imagine your whole being suffering in chaos, everywhere you looked you were dazzled, every thing you heard was deafening, you were possessed by ideology, the world conspires against you, the sky was endlessly falling, everyone you depended upon lies to you ----- this is reality for some people so no wonder post-modernism is appealing to that person."

why would the most high want to be called be associated to this? is this the way truth that truth is supposed to be? the answer is no.

matthew 13:44 says the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. key words: field and hidden.
where is usually a field located? its outside the city. a city involves a lot of people and common thought. we see religion associated to that city just as we see religious colleges and universities as well.
matthew 7:14 says narrow is the gate that leads to life and FEW find it. 

so considering this, are we really told the truth in religion as it relates to religious topics, debates and discussions? is the truth told in all these religious schools and universities. i personally do not think so, in a world controlled by the powers that be, in the world full of lies, dominated by personal ignorance and lack of knowledge.

There are so many things you touch on that quite apparently show me that you haven't yet really dealt with any of the puritans or reformed theologians of the past. You take an abstract allegorical approach to the biblical accounts much in the vein of Origen and I think that although it is a motivator for you to continue which I like, I think that it can lead you down a futile path.
If you instead read reformed writers like Calvin, Kistemaker, or Pink's Gleanings, I think you can make better more sound progress.

Take for example your recent realization of the mind's Master/Emissary roles as compared theologically. Moses was directed to divide his work amongst a certain number of men so that he would not be distracted from the prime work under his care. Or likewise,  Acts 6:2 where the apostles directed disciples to tend tables so that the apostles could be devoted to a separated work. Much of the new things you are exploring and finding is old theological gold and has been thoroughly expounded by the greats of the reformed christian tradition.
Be well."

But your knowledge of Bible and how you trying to interpret it here is really not what the Bible speaks about and what it is all about. You did not inform your audience about there is a biblical study out there that dealing with everything about it.  You misinformed them with the Yahwist,  Elohist and Deuteronomist view which was trying to delegitimate the Book of Genesis as being written by a singe person which in effect was to question the authority of The Scriptures as the Word of God and was debunked by Hebrew Scholars. You don't explain to the audience where these idea of Yahwist,  Elohist,  Deuteronomist came from,  when and how it started,  and what it did to the Bible.  You did not do your homework to thoroughly study it yet you came up with your own interpretations of it based on your  understanding.  You are intelligent person,  and you are at the forefront of defending the importance of the linguistic values but you seemed to not understand the Biblical language at all,  but I hope you will take time to learn about it not necessarily to learn Hebrew or Aramaic but you can study how it works and the psychology of that language of course.  It is wrong that Genesis is written by several persons in different time period jusr by seeing how the specific words are used in chapters.  You must know, in  that The original manuscript of the Scriptures in Hebrew there are no chapters nor verses marking.  All were written continuously without the marking of chapters or verses numbering.  It was later add up to make easy for people in their reading.  And there is no such thing as some chapters refer to God solely with the Term YHWH and the others specifically only refering to God in the term Elohim.  You need to just read the Genesis thoroughly to note that both terms are used either independently or appeared together throughout the Genesis.  And you said conveniently about why YHWH is not being said like there is no reason for that yet you keep talking about ten commandments..you don't explain that there is a commandment regarding God's Name there  in the ten commandments.  You also don't seem to know the worldview of Hebrew/Jewish people,  their thoughts,  their cultute,  their language and their view of God,  yet you extensively talk about Mesopotamian worldview in general.  Isn't it about psychological significance of the Bible? Yet you talk about this and that for a very long time to finaly come to the Genesis.

And Genesis is not a psychological book or even scientific one even it contains those aspects,  but that is not the aim of the Bible,  the aim for the Bible is that people know The God and live according to His will.  

And the Genesis does not teach that God transform the world from chaos into order. It literally said God created the world.  There is no room for interpretation in that,  it literally said God created it out of nothing.  You are trying to inject Mesopotamian worldview into Genesis.  Mesopotamian mythology was presented in Poetry,  that is how Enuma Elish is written,  but Genesis is written in narative form not in poetic language,  it was written in historical account/narative. It presented us with genealogy,  with names of individuals,  places,  and also detailing events that happening as a historical account not a poetry or metaphorical story.  In the story of Noah it even give detail measurement of the ark that Noah built,  and how he should build it and how long it takes for him to build it.  That is nowhere to be found of other Mesopotamian account of the same flood story.  
And there is something you must know about Hebrew,  that every number represent its own meaning, that is why there is a meaning to the measurement of the ark that Noah built if you askes a Jewish bible teacher about it,  about the ten day plague of Egypt,  etc,  and even a word have its particular meaning independently from the sentence or sentencen it existed in.  That is why you must read it carefully before you come out with interpretation.  It is indeed a complex collective books  but at the same time it is not that complicated to understand  if you just follow what King Shlomo said,  fear the Lord,   here you make it like it is really so complicated to understand it,  while you quoting the verse which King Shlomo said but partially.  The complete verse is in Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."" and in roverbs 1:7 says, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction."",  He said clearly that to attain Wisdom/Knowledge one needs to fear the Lord and he clearly said that the opposite is fools who despise wisdom and instructions,  he meant by instruction is God's commandments and statutes,  and the capital LORD is translated from the YHWH. It did not use the term God/Elohim or Elohai,  but literally use the Name of the Elohim. Elohim gave the Name to Moshe when he asked for it.  Moshe indeed ask the Name,  he is being specific in that because of the circumstance with Israelites.  And God gave Moshe the Name He is to be known and be called by Israelites forever.   He even told Moshe what He was known by Avraham. You know in NEA world,  a name is really not just important to identify someone,  a Name represent the whole existence of a person, his characters, his whole being.  That is why for NEA world a Name is so powerful,  that if you can reveal someone's name means you can overpower that person. Just as described in the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel when he realised that he was struggling with not a mere human being,  he demanded to know his name,  but instead the angel bless him and changed his name from Jacob to Israel.  The story in itself has a profound meaning about transformation which Jacob experienced from that moment on in his life.  

I really appreciate the things you have said and you have my utmost respect for thinga you stand for.  But in this particular series of your Bible view,  I can not agree with it despites the many good points you make of it.  But the truth is Bible can speak for itself,  it can speak of its meaning by itself,  and to know that Bible says clearly you Need the One who give those words.  Yeshua said ask the Holy Spirit. In your talk you downplay the role of the Holy Spirit,  you put so much emphasis of logos which is greek word for The Word in the first verse of the book of John. And any Christian could explain that to you that The Word is refering to God as The Holy Spirit.  God is Spirit, Yeshua taught about that.  Yeshua is the embodiment of the Word in the flesh,  that is the Son if God mean.  And the concept of trinity is not something Christianity found.  It is drawn from Biblical view of God.  But God is not abstraction,  that is not biblical teaching.  

You can not also view it from evolutionary approach since Bible did not teach that we are product of evolutionary process,  Bible teach us that we are created beings,  we were humans since the creation time.  With all respect,  you must study the Bible thoroughly and understand it the way it present itself as.  To undersrand the Word of God you need the Holy Spirit to guide and teach you,  that is what it tells when Shomo said fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom/knowledge.  To fear the Lord means to follow His Words,  and to follow His Words ia through Holy Spirit guidance.  You can draw many good points from the stories you like to draw from from the Bible,  but you could be in danger of abusing the Word of God which is a blasphemy by the very commandments,  the laws and the statutes given in the Bible no matter how good the points you make of them.  I hope you would not just brushing it of from various scholar opinions which really sad that you took the very misleading view of the so called J,  E,  D perspective which has been debunked by many Hebrew and Biblical scholars."
UgxIrXWjZ0V4ZscXvlZ4AaABAg,dr techtek,1529550046585,"Actually, god in the Hebrew version of the bible is been spoken in a feminine language and the people of Israel are spoken as a man. In many Bible passages, the people of Israel and God are spoken like a wife and husband."
UgzhQKNjEVEMcly38b94AaABAg,Warrior Chic,1529550046589,"This is a really deep subject. All of this info is correct but fragmented in a sense. Statements are very true. It has to do with the whole of everything. Dreams are how we learn and rationalize the world around us, the things, not only that happen to us but what we need to learn. We have to process things in our dreams as a way to reconcile our world. It is interesting that biology plays an important role in this too. Too little B6 and you won't dream, too much and you have nightmares. If we don't dream our memories are on hold and our brains build up in a fog. Our dreams will play out events of the day as little plays that have little to do with what actually happened. A dream of being stabbed could play out in hundreds of different ways until our brains say, ""ok I can live with that"" then it is stored and we move on. In the bible it says everything that happens now has happened before, there is nothing new. this is what the stories of the Bible are trying to tell us. learn from the stories.  Just my thoughts.

This is basic stereotyping of others who do not fall into the box Jordan seems to be comfortable accepting. I will say this, that I myself who question your religious doctrine consider myself to be rational because of it, not in spite of it. It is only common sense to question or be agnostic about something that does not provide 'absolute' proof. To accept without question is naive and gullible and civilizations have been controlled for centuries by those that use fear and superstition to control and take advantage of the masses. Those that do question are threatened or shunned and it is this very shunning or alienation that leads to the depression or anxiety and not the other way around. Fortunately, in this day and age many are in agreement with me and I do not find myself alone in my belief or lack there of. This is one of the main reasons that Politics and Religion must be separated when it comes to ruling a civilized society, for it is the freedom to think for oneself and believe what you choose to that represents the very freedom we all strive for. It is important to remember that just because many may believe in something this does not necessarily make it true. Fascists were able to almost take over the World due to this very ability to convince the many and dis-communicate the few. It is the inability to provide absolute proof that makes everyone agnostic as opposed to atheist as well for you can no easier disprove the existence of a God than you can prove it."

UgwJQdS3OFOATA7K9NZ4AaABAg,Nicolas Deso,1529550048238,"In my opinion. When people, in general, start to categorize nouns, then its inevitable for separation. Its humor natural human behavior for us to jump to conclusions, to judge, to fear; to hate, to love. As living beings on earth we all have been already pre destined in our ways and our future. It doesn't matter on how much you toss your pearls in the wrong direction and get them soiled. But, a learning process. Age doesn't matter behind the experience. But, intellect, knowledge, experience and discipline (maturity) has a lot to do with the outcome of the world as a whole. Behind the psychological aspect whenever someone is challenged or people get poked, taunted. People become threatened. Defensively drowning in their own thoughts and emotions. In simpler terms, ""Its the nature of the beast."" People were created to imperfect on purpose, but perfect in His image. Simply us being God's creation. It is not our position to 100% understand why or how we got here per say, but taking our Lord's word for it. We would be completely lost if we were to focused on how things are done instead of having water going under the bridge. People can literally drive themselves crazy to death if they worked to hard to the point, then they actually miss the point entirely. Here we are conscious and not knowing. Its not our job to know everything. Let me ask you something. 'Is it easier to be yourself relying on a higher power rather than being that higher power and fixing everything? I would choose to be broken hands down. Knowing I am broken and misunderstood makes me feel more alive than the know it all. There is no fun or curiosity in anything if you were like God or Lucy for that matter. If some of you didn't understand the 'Lucy' statement go watch the movie. Long story short, the point that I'm trying to make is that when things are forced, categorized or bent over backwards to be a certain way. Life always finds a way. Okay, You ever try to keep a dog in the back yard for days on end? Obviously you take care of it. Food, water, go out walking from time to time. Dogs were made with Love already in their hearts. That's why Dogs pass away after 10 years versus us living for 100 years for us to figure out Love. Our one and only reason why we were made is to love one and another unconditionally. We were created to be here for each other. Not born to destroy or hate...that would be ridiculous. So, I plead of you. If you took anything out of what I just said in any way. Please reevaluate your life. God Bless! #OneLove #LetThereBeLight"

You can also watch the first/last episode of STNG that is yet another analogy for what this is a hex which means hell or to curse & agon which means trial or GO=green backward as AN is 114 meaning information backward hence curse of HAM.  Esoteric means to describe to decipher reality through an AI prism.  HAM is also THEM which is a play on US/THEM & relates to CRONus except that name is like a different program language or instance of creation like how they say this is the 6th instance of NEO meaning new or green or GO hence Prometheus being blamed for (expansion of)creation for awareness & how some call him the engineer or the fire person hence the name charles.

Thanks for sharing the video! Safe travels!

-Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. 
-But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and it's these things that defile a man, For out of the heart come evil thoughts. 
-Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it flow the springs of life. 
-The mind of man plans his way, but  God directs his steps. 
-A man’s steps are from God; how then can man understand his own way? God, I know that people's lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps. 
-Then He said to me, ""Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, ""Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life."" 
-The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

I picture wind bringing air, our breath brings it to the blood, which takes it to the organs such as the brain and heart,  we breath out, the mind thinks, the body moves, while the tongue speaks. The breath is return to the air."

UgxA33yv4YAeAp1uZtJ4AaABAg,Max Imus,1526871655500,Somewhere in this series of lectures Dr. Peterson dismisses a woman's reasoning for not wanting to bring a child into the world without giving a counter argument. Surely as the only self-conscious beings the 'delayed gratification' behaviour of not procreating and preventing further suffering (as life is largely suffering) is one of the biggest sacrifices a human being can make as opposed to having a child and 'offering it up' to the world (which is a line of logic he also pursues)
UgzUF4-qx6jNjXd_0pZ4AaABAg,HarryM2000,1526871655505,"“We think things we don’t act out, and act out things we don’t dream” wow, that has to be the truest representation of people’s struggle to overcome themselves. It’s such an obstacle when so many of us may have these fantastic ideas and visions of our life and adding positivity to the world and yet we can’t find the motivation within ourselves to act them out. I am one of those people and similar to how Mr. Peterson has previously described the lack of encouragement in this world to try something new and fully focus yourself on something not done before, we often just revert back to our everyday habits and actions which keep us from success. I think the main lesson to learn from this is to always show encouragement to friends and family and not let yourself become deterred from trying something different. A little can definitely go a long way."

UgypLV3ahwpZjxRS0nF4AaABAg,Devin McLellan-Kavanagh,1526871657103,"Thread on beauty starting at 2:02:25.
My point of focus starting at 2:04:37 and arriving at the question of why we experience things as beautiful.

Neurologically, our brain pays attention to the unfamiliar. The unfamiliar is information, a new element of our reality to be wrestled into our understanding.
When something unfamiliar appears non-threatening (based on the information we’ve familiarized as non-threatening), I speculate that we experience a feeling of detachment from reality—realizing our reality is more than we currently understand.
A psychologically destabilizing experience to some degree, minus the physical feelings of our usual threat response. (Mystical perhaps?)

I believe our brains consider the new information to contain a message of causality. By decoding such a message, behaviour responses (based on the new pieces to the causal puzzle) may be determined. 
Our brain “projects” our puzzle as our experience (our perception of the information of reality) and we respond to it with behaviour we determine integrates us coherently. 

I would now like to turn my attention to rarity. Roughly speaking, why it is defaulted to beautiful, like the gem stones that Peterson had mentioned for example.
I consider rarity to be “delicate order” or in other words, an improbable event (witnessing the existence of something is an event) in the causality puzzle that we are currently perceiving and integrating with.
10000:1 is far more delicate than 2:1. Far many more factors must align for a 10000:1 event to take place. 
The more causally improbable an event (based on comparison to our current puzzle-perception), the greater the beauty experienced.

Experiencing delicate order is beauty.

How delicate the order of an event is can be considered the measure of quality—more delicate equals higher quality and the greater the experience of beauty.

Learning expands our internal ratios of delicate order. 
Learning increases beauty.
I believe a sunset is more beautiful the more you learn about cosmology, because you learn how causally improbable it really is, witnessing such an event. 

• In furthering the thought that the inherent mechanism of consciousness is to learn to causally integrate in a coherent manner with the information of reality...
Do we all have an initial event that we can access in memory, of first witnessing existence at all—our causal starting point?
Is “God” the initial consciousness? The initial causal starting point? The Infinity:1 experience of which we all can relate to through our initial event?
Is DNA the storage device of our evolutionary family’s collective causal puzzle and how to integrate with it?
Can we traverse this collective causal memory, re-experiencing the initial events of the decoded messages that allowed us coherent integration for this long? Would this bring us closer to the divine and ultimate experience of beauty?
God’s memory? 
Is enlightenment when we attain constant Infinity:1 experience of our current puzzle-perception by experiencing all of these events that shaped it?"

It's a window into the past, a window which you will only see through if you read between the lines. I don't believe the bible has a single damned thing to do with god, not the real one.

I get it.  There are good rules that cant be fully justified by science or reason and just have to be taken on faith.  The problem is that (certain?) religions got so bloated with bad rules used to manipulate the population that if you took them all on faith you became almost as screwed up as if you had no rules at all.

I get the case that on balance he feels that we made the wrong choice to get rid of religion and I even agree with him, but right now I'm thinking the guy is using religion as a way of slowly winding down his prominence and losing his popularity, saving himself a precipitous fall from grace, which he may feel is inevitable otherwise."

Ugwpn8DPYPdeOINsO314AaABAg,fillinman1,1526871660082,"Mr Peterson.  My reading of Scripture is guided by principles that I suppose you've many times been exposed to.  But just reconsider.  The first time I saw the bible prophecy verse that has the time expression  ""a time and times and half a time""  I knew immediately what was meant.  Time is a single unit.  Half a time is self explanatory.  But times is what?  2?  3?  5000?  Well there is only one answer that can be universally arrived at.  2.   It must be the simplest explanation or there is no explanation.  (well except that the time period is also measured in days and months.)  I often hear people saying the Bible can be interpreted so many different ways.  I disagree.  The book is written to be clear.  Even for simple people.  It is not like many video games where one must expect certain types of trickery by the games authors.  

If the Book doesn't say just what it clearly says without extrapolation, expansion, adjustment or apology, it says little.  These Words are Life and Truth itself.  Certainly, the Bible contains   fairly specific promises that are operable through faith.  There is a promise of eternal life, no less.  Many others.  There are ""how to's"" as to the operation of faith and of other spiritual tools available to us.  There is sufficient detailed explanation of these real and powerful tools so that anybody can put them to use to do things clearly impossible according to the rules of the physics of this world.  Joan of Arc?  

Going on in explanation to the question of which interpretation is right,  True, there are topics that are not well explained.  So we don't know what is meant.  We don't need to know.  If a topic isn't well covered, then there is no clear meaning.  Many interesting thoughts are brought up just enough to tantalize.  These will be mysteries.  Some passages can only be clearly understood by comparing distant passages that are without doubt discussing the same topic.  Taking a bit from here and a bit from there.  But this is a slippery slope.  The hallmark of a false bible doctrine is a verse from here, a passage from there, and some symbolism that is interpreted using a hebrew dictionary or commentary from somebody all rolled u according to the individual that claims he alone is endlightened in this wonderful truth .

The world is about 6000 years old.  you just add up time from the birth of one generation to the birth of the next.  Some big chunks of time make it easier.  I know how nutty that might sound.  There are so many good refutations of the notion of evolution.  There are so many confirmations of the existence and movements of the families that sprung up shortly after the flood.  The book doesn't read anything like a fiction.  People are named.  Big cities, villages, tribes, are identified.  Ancient customs are detail.  As God questions Job rhetorically of his ability to confront Leviathon, He cites a number of the tactics of the day that were surely used in the capture of similar creatures.  Marco Polo, Alexander's scientists, several of the Roman and Greek era thinkers, and many more recent witnesses give startling testimony to their own experiences with dinosaurs.  And now soft tissue including blood with viable genetic material has been discovered in any number of T Rex femur's.  Stretchy blood vessels.  

The Bible speaks of Strong Delusion being provided to make it easier for those who don't want the truth.  And the human mind is capable of believing lies if it so chooses.  We know this.  God is Libertarian.  Free will is critical.  and people must be able to function though even totally deluded for the act of willing obedience to be our expression of love for our creator.  

If anything read in the bible can be taken literally, it must be taken literally.  There is no other possible way for God to surely communicate with us through his Word.  It must be so!"

UgyOBeEV_ywsrcPwW3h4AaABAg,Caleb Edwards,1526871664639,"Since adolescence I've struggled with authority.  My first encounter with police was after climbing a tree at my parent's softball game at a public park in the US.  As a 10y/o boy raised in the country I had a pocket knife, BB gun, and loved exploring the woods behind my house with my younger brother.  As I was sitting on a low branch about 10ft up a 30ft tree overlooking the baseball diamond a man approached and told me that I was not allowed to be up there and to get down.  Slightly shaken and nervous over the confrontation I immediately obeyed and sat on the bleachers.  At the end of the game I told my mom about what happened. She confronted the man, agitated, and informed him that he didn't have the authority to tell her kids what to do and that I was doing nothing wrong. He then revealed himself to be a police officer, and said that kids can't climb trees in the park.  There was no law against it, but he became aggressive and insisted that we had to comply with his orders.  I didn't understand the entire situation, but I ended up seeing my mother handcuffed and threatened with arrest.  Since then I've had issues with authority--always wary of police, and somewhat resentful.  My grade school classes were visited by a DARE officer who assigned us skits about saying no to drugs.  We made prop joints and cigarettes to enact scenarios and were scolded for it, and of course the whole class was terrified at the reaction of the officer--thinking we could be arrested over it.  When I got my license to drive I was pulled over for exceeding the speed limit on a few occasions--and already having a bad attitude toward cops I argued every time.  A few times a verbal discussion looked like it might lead to arrest or violence just due to perceived disrespect.  Later in life I descended into drug and alcohol use for other reasons presumably, but continued to have interactions with police (all non-violent, but leading to short periods of encarceration.

All of these events seem to have left me with a disdain for authority.  My partners have all remarked about my attitude over the years, and I've always been unable to explain why I feel that way .  I've come to think something is wrong with me--I'm not left leaning on many issues, but most of the conservatives I know tend to make me uneasy in how supportive and unquestioning of law enforcement.  I have lingering fear, and aversion to authoritarians---and often think about what makes so many people believe that the state is inherently correct.  I think I'm ""Libertarian"" because of my experience, and commonly face ridicule and dismissive attitudes.  Is it a psychological condition?  In reality is anyone ""right"" or ""good""?  How do you reconcile these kind of things?  Are they necessary, beneficial, and should we accept the idea of justice that is enforced by government today?  Should we allow someone to assign punishment that will change entire lives?  Does any human being have the right to pass enormous sentences on another without having experienced the situation around the crime or felt even a fraction of the punishment they inflict?"

Ugx3XlOi5ymCRkfcYb14AaABAg,paulchri69,1526871664652,"I am a young earth creationist as it is set forth by the bible. I still like hearing from rational people who study our humanity, because I do not believe that it conflicts with what the bible teaches about humanity.  I do not consider the theory of biological evolution to be science, therefor it just exists as another belief system that people can use to fill the gaps. It is interesting to hear this man use the term ""god knows"", because a simple interpretive evaluation clearly concludes that what he means is ""nobody knows"", but is a little out of place, or ironic, in a talk with this subject matter. Those who believe in a spiritual being that they call ""god"" use the word in a different context, and such which refers to god as a person. After listening to many of his talks, it appears that what the bible prescribes as a solution to our human shortcomings lines up well with many of his prescribed solutions, both as it pertains to an individual, and that of a society. I do like hearing the deep evaluations of those things which are produced from empirical evidence.  There are many comparative similarities between man and nature. If there is no tangible god, then I would personally have to conclude that humans will never know the truth of our origins, and will continue to progress toward total destruction of ourselves. The biblical account is not so much different, because it concludes with our current human condition ending in a storm of totally  destructive events. You could say that our built in instinct for self preservation causes us to make judgments about morality that works in our favor concerning survival, but we also must believe that such an instinct had to exist very early in our ""evolution"", and had to be almost universal in nature for nature to product such a complexity of interdependent species. Then you have the problem of the empirical evidence pointing to there being only a loss of information in  nature, rather than an increase that would allow such diversity to thrive, which causes you to have to utilize faith in your assumptive conclusions about how we got here, and the subsequent time frames in which you believe they took place. It is perfectly reasonable to believe in things that you cannot prove, and both evolutionists and creationists exercise such faith. I appreciate how often Mr. Peterson admits that we don't know things, and that they are too complex to deal with thoroughly through simplification of just about any issue in this world. We will never know what we don't know, and in my opinion, we know enough to destroy ourselves, but don't know enough to preserve ourselves, and the human condition is such that if there was a person who knew enough, they would be unable to implement whatever it is that he knows. One thing that I appreciate about the bible is that it has showed me that hope in the future of mankind is futile, therefor I can go forward in life without false hope, wasting my time trying to correct society. The bible puts the focus on the individual, and I am glad that Mr. Peterson does also."

A lil' something for people to know who don't want to be ""bamboozled"" by this man's FALSE teachings: 

KJV 1 John 5:1-13, 

1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 

2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 

3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 

4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 

5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 

6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 

7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 

8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 

9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 

10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 

11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 

12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 

13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
___________________________________________________________

I have nothing ""personal"" against Mr. Peterson. He's a great intellectual and orator; but his ""teachings"" and ""messages"" are WRONG and *SINFUL*. 

Please don't be ""deceived"" and THINK FOR YOURSELF people. I ain't ""fooled"" with this stuff though. 

Hope Mr. Peterson can ""do better"" for himself is all. Amen...

Bro. Jed"
UgxClVwemX9q7U5uOx54AaABAg,Jed Mask,1526871664679,"Mr. Peterson, hope you are well. 

Even though you might not ""acknowledge Him"" doesn't mean God doesn't exists. 

Lord Jesus Christ *LOVES YOU*. He is our Creator. 

Like many things in this ""real life"" it is *BLACK & WHITE*: two sides we must choose from. 

Good & Evil. Life & Death. 

The ""Defense & the Prosecuted"". Guilty or innocent? 

You might not ""like the idea"" of having to ""choose a side"" by like many ""fence-straddlers"" throughout history they have had to learn ""the hard way"" that if they don't ""choose a side""; they'll end up choosing one or the other in the end. 

Life is no ""neutrality"" Mr. Peterson. 

You either ""believe there is a God"" or ""don't believe there is a God"". 

It is ""effeminate"" and non-masculine for a man not to ""take a stand"" on any given issue at hand. ""Indecisiveness"" is no virtue here. 

I'll go ahead and say it: I believe in God Almighty Lord Jesus Christ. It seems you do not believe God exists? You do not make it CLEAR and CONFIRMED which you should if you believe God exists. That's it. 

May you be *BLESSED*:  http://jesus-is-savior.com/how_to_be_saved.html 

KJV 1 Timothy 6:3-5, 

3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 

4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 

5 Pervese disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

the passion of peterson
can be arguable stated
in 20 of his pivotal life events
and the holy
he has given
to the hopeless
men on the edge
feeling like hell
who disagree profoundly
with gender ideology
who are on the peripheries
and margins of
the social and diplomatic
political corrects

the passion of peterson
was seen 
to my minds eye
when he discovered
at the age of 12
he had found the
love of his life
his beloved
wife

the passion of peterson
is only questionalbe
as he like the reverend 
della resse rip
he founded and started
his own church
he makes all the rules
up
himself
as he is about Truth HImself
on the fence :)

the passion of peterson
is sensed now today
on the global 
and worldly scale

so watch this space
will he for the sake of his
wife, his
daughter Mikailia
and granddaughter 
Scarlet
be humble enough
to say thanks 
to his holy majesty
to Truth himself
accept
and to the Mother of God

He said that, the thoughts that we have, are our ancestors, that the words we speak are that of a collection of spirits. It's exactly what my voices have told me. Dealing with this disease had put me into a spiral. They have their own personalities, they have told me their names. They have a unique voice I have never heard before, unless they are mimicking someone famous or a family member who has passed away, when they mimic people they are not always dead. Anyways these thoughts are killing me. They will tell me how to spell words I don't know how to spell. Talk to me about the inner workings of language. They pushed me to write hundreds of pages. To work on any story I would like. Talking me things like, I'm writing Genesis, or parts of the Bible I've never read before, let alone heard of. What scares me is. I feel like Jordan Peterson is in on something. Something that I know to be true. It's a question that keeps me up at night. How do I know what I don't know. How can I create a thought that has its own personality its own biases its own goals. Took me months to realize I was hearing voices in my head. Because you don't sound like voices they sound like an outside force communicating with me. What I fear is that all beings on the planet are having the same conversation that I am having. Maybe in their own little ways of course I'd have to assume that everyone's conversation is unique in some matter. I'm starting to think that being schizophrenic might mean, that the Masquerade the they play on everyone else on the planet, it's different for those who have mental illnesses. They communicate with you without you knowing. And when you hear the voices they pretend to be strangers, yet they  have known you your whole life. I would do anything for the answers.

I've watched many of Dr. Peterson's videos and interviews, and I had supposed him to be a believer in Christ, based on those  videos, but now I'm confused...

Although I am familiar with a couple different assumptions regarding the creation story, the differences (I've heard) are focused on the ""when"", not the ""what"". 

I know some believers disagree on WHEN creation happened and the meaning of a ""day"" (whether it means the same as it does now or of it was representative of a longer period of time), but I had never heard of a believer who disagreed with WHAT happened during Creation.

Dr. Peterson seems to believe in the evolution theory of origin, rather than the Creation theory. And considering the fundamental role that Creation plays in a Christian's beliefs, it's not possible to believe in God, but also believe that people are just really impressive monkeys.

By losing this ability to survive you need new methods to hold those memories, painting and speech for example, but that does not mean that the trasmiting of informations generation by generation can not be damaged (by wrong transforms) or tranforms that gives zero results. 
(The fall)
When you overload yourself with data you need simple algorithms to use that data, but when you overload yourself with algorithms you forget the data (similar not same)
(to live by the measure)

So you need to accept God the source of informations when you do mistakes (sins) instead of trying to fix the failed algorithms that doesn't work anymore.
translation: You need to try to learn-accept new things when you are at the points of nothing works
(forgivness of sins)

Although I think there are areas in many of your arguments that you make assertions or assumptions that may not fit the narrative of everyone. For example, you often insist that every good behavior is predicated on judeo-Christian belief it at least implied. Although I tend to agree that there is some truth to this, but in gradations and based on the individual. 

For citizens in the West that have nothing but Christian influence, I believe this is true to a very very high degree. However, for a lot of people that have other cultural influences, their foundational belief systems are not purely judeo-Christian system. 

The other point is that I actually find your lectures fascinating. However, I think you might be over exposed in the areas of faith, and some unclear and unsubstantiated claims that you make.

You have to be born again and Baptized in the Holy Spirit to even begin to understand the depths and the heights of almighty God. You need an intimate relationship with God, prayerfully asking Him to reveal His Word of truth. Without this, you cannot understand the spiritual and without Him, you can do nothing. You may be very intelligent to the world, but unless you are in Christ, you know nothing. Only God can open ones understanding to the spiritual , unseen to us mortals unless He Jesus reveals , you will only be guessing as to what it all means.  That is why so many travel the broad way that leads to destruction because they are depending on their own interpretation and not leaning on God for the answer to all their questions. When man goes to others to find answers to spiritual questions,  we will not find what we seek, except through humility and realizing we are not gods, but His creation. Humbly going to God and admitting you know nothing and you want to receive the truth, not what you have perceived to be the truth, through your own imagination.  The trouble with man, is , his mind gets in the way. God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts and we can never imagine the spiritual realm.
   Dr. Peterson, stick to what you know and teach what you do know, but as for the Words of Life, you need to talk to God about that."

So what?
More is all you need ,
As you suck on natures milk,
You tell yourself,
You did your best,
You think you're good,
As you burn in your living hell,
You’ve done your best,
As you live in your living hell,
You support your culture from the heart,
Forever trusting who you are,
You won’t open your mind for a different view,
You never cared for what they do,
Never cared for what they knew,
So you can watch your mother die,
Watch your father die,
You take no chances,
Where do you take this pain of yours?
You hate it so you don’t care,
You don’t want it,

It was the fundamental instrument of power, besides force, of the roman empire. Sure enough, it has an inkling to the human consciousness, that is obvious, not only in its power to seduce or inspire (depending on your disposition to it) but so does a lot of evil. By that I mean, greed, hunger for power, conformity are deep potential diapositions of the psyche as history has shown. It was the critique of Nietzsche unto humanity. Its sinful proclivities. And as old as those potential dispositions are in our psyche, are the ways that we've come up with to acertain and follow them. I mean, much of the tests of humanity in the bible are the same as today. It comes down to are you humble or arrogante in the face of the mystery? Are you honest or deceitful? Are you q control power freak or do you rely on faith? Drugs, sex, power, war, deceit and a bunch of other sinful activities of humanity have served to deviate our attention and engagement with what is crucial and could lead to betterment. How can we be sure to the extent that the bible serves that same purpose of dampening a distracting what could otherwise be, a genuine religious approach? How can we be sure of the extent to which is an actual depiction of the morality that ia unconsciously and consciously carried out and desired by humanity? This are deep and hard questions, but as the bible serves to define humanity and existance it is absolutely of worth to ask ourselves how much of it is simply designed to brainwash us. It can absolutely just be the best brainwashing operation humanity has ever known. The fact that it has been with us this long doesn't at all dispense with that possibility and it seems to me it is a matter that requires much, much, much, much more discussion."

I started watching this video and noticed he started taking some weird conclusions. Like something coming from ""nowhere"" in 24:13 - Well, before creating God we need to create the place where he'll exist. So we need this idea of ""nowhere"", some place ""spiritual"".

I've met some people who'd also struggle with this and they often change ""God"" by ""something"", ""something else"", ""it can't be explained"", etc. There's a difference between ""it can't be explained"" and ""we can't explain it today"". If something literally cannot be explained, then it's stupid to pursue its explanation. By definition it will never be found. The second one makes us believe we simply need to improve, keep trying and eventually we will find an explanation.

I then went watching another video called ""Jordan Peterson: Do You Believe That God Exists?"" [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0O8Jw6grro ] where he tries really hard to obfuscate the answer by making it very complex, but it seems to me he's finding it very difficult to accept that there might not be a God (like really, honestly accepting it. Not simply saying it to appear intellectual). I have also left my reply in the comments section of this other video, where I admit that I also struggle with this issue (and thus why maybe it's easier for me to notice it in him)."

TIDBITS I CULLED FROM THE LECTURE:

"" (1957) - ""I would like to say a very few words about the second chapter, because one great difficulty of the beginning of the Bible is that there is a two-fold account of creation, one in chapter one and another in chapters two to three.  The first chapter of the Bible contains a cosmology which is overarched by an account of the creation of the world, a cosmology which is integrated into an account of the creation of the world.  This integration of cosmology into an account of creation implies the depreciation of heaven. Heaven is not divine; heaven is subordinate in rank to earth, to life on earth [PN:  depreciation of heaven, this means the ""heavens"" with their stars, planets, sun, because God did not want men to worship the heavenly bodies ]. 

“But this cosmology used by the Bible, as distinguished from the assertion regarding creation...[by definition, cosmology] is based on evidence accessible to man as man, whereas the assertion of the createdness of the world is not based on such evidence.  Hence the question arises: with what right is the horizon of cosmology, of the things we see, describe and understand, transcended -- or, in other words, what's wrong with cosmology? 

“What is wrong with man's effort to find his bearing in the light of what is evident to man as man?  What is the true character of human life?   What is the right life of man? 

“This question is the starting point of the second account of creation in the second chapter. The first account ENDS with man; the second account BEGINS with man.

“It seems that an account which ends with man is not sufficient.  Why?  In the first account, man is created on the same day as the terrestrial animals, he is seen as part of the whole, if as its most exalted part.  In this perspective, the absolute difference between man and all other creatures is not adequately seen.  lt appears from the first account that man is separated to the highest degree, that he can move or change his place, in a very metaphorical sense even, to the highest degree.  But this privilege, this liberty, freedom, is also a great danger.  Man is the most ambiguous creature; HENCE MAN IS NOT CALLED GOOD, JUST AS HEAVEN IS NOT CALLED GOOD.  There is a connection between the ambiguity of man, the danger to which man is essentially exposed, and heaven, with what heaven stands for, the attempt to find one's bearing in the light of what is evident to man as man, the attempt to possess knowledge of good and evil like the gods. 

“Now if man is the most ambiguous creature, in fact the only ambiguous creature, we need a supplement to that account in which man appears also as part of the whole.  We need an account which focuses on man alone; more precisely, since ambiguity means ambiguity in regard to good and evil, we need an additional account in which man's place is defined, not only as it was in the first account by a command ""Be fruitful and multiply"" in general, but by a negative command, a  prohibition.  For a prohibition sets forth explicitly the limitations of man - up to this point and not beyond! - the limit separating the good from the evil.

“The second chapter of the Bible answers the question not about how the world has come into being but how human life, human life as we know it, has come into being.  ....

""... the second account of creation distributes accents differently than the first account had done.  Man is now said to be, not created in the image of God, but dust from the earth.  Furthermore, in the first account man is created as the ruler of the beasts.  In the second account the beasts come to sight rather as helpers or companions of man.  Man is created in lowliness; he was not tempted therefore to disobey either by need or by his high estate. ”"

UgyAc5uTyOUF7-YXsAR4AaABAg,Andy Drees,1524279681942,"All you've done here Dr. Peterson is articulate the formation of false idols in human history. The Israelite's didn't introduce the idea of a new idol, their whole story rejects idolatry because it acknowledges the existence of a real God that actually exists and who reaches out to us in a way that we can not deny. In that story it reaches the point where they couldn't even accept the reality of God's presence among them, revealed in very miraculous and powerful ways. This is demonstrated in the golden calf, where without God's continued conversation with them through Moses, they attempt to make sense of things by their creativity, in associating these things that had happened with this created thing, that they can see, touch and feel. What you're so confused about here, is how these ideas came about, but that's just it, these aren't merely ideas or artistic expressions, it is a given truth, not revealed by the human imagination, but given by a disruption from outside the human person like you keep alluding to. The problem is you keep trying to tie it back to a physical reality that brings it about ... which IS idolatry and completely impossible. Humanity doesn't discover God, humanity rejects God. God reaches out to us, and hasn't stopped since He first created us in the beginning. And my gosh, these occurrences can not be completely explained by psychedelics or dreams, especially in cases where enormous groups of people have the same experience, like what occurred in Fatima, Portugal, which wasn't imposed on the witnesses by a long process or by a human origin. 
The conversation between Christ and Pilot in the Gospel illustrates this human insanity that rejects God and flees idolatry because we don't want to accept the ""cross"" ... this realization of what Truth demands of us, which is most often more than we can accept. From my viewpoint of history, this seems to be more of the case. People aren't necessarily trying to figure it all out, it's this cyclical story of people fleeing from reality, but our ultimate realization of the necessity of Truth for peace and goodness and for reality to even continue is what causes people to return to sanity, but unfortunately this is usually only realized after great chaos and calamity and suffering occur on a mass scale. God allows these things to happen to us, so that we might return to Him ... to Truth. Each time we return to Truth, we understand It a bit more clearly. This is best understood in the context of a relationship with another being outside ourselves, this is where we accept the reality of our Creator, who IS, and who is teaching us how to BE in relationship with Him and with creation. I can tell you my fear of God, comes from a lived experience, and a personal battle with my acceptance of reality, which I now realize is God. God's reality is now, by a singular expression and eternal act of love, manifested in the human person and human life of Jesus Christ. It all coalesces to Jesus. He is the answer to all your questions. It all comes back to him."

I have dozens of friends who have either enrolled via youtube onto one or more of your lecture courses, or begun a self authoring program or followed the recent global debates concerning political correctness, postmodernism, neo-marxism and other potentially dangerous ideologies. I have watched 100s of your talks and interviews and i had expected to be bored or over-saturated by now. Not a bit. Your eloquence, intelligence and passion for the truth and for critical thinking; your respect for life, art and philosophy and your appreciation and articulation of the consciousness of our species, continues to inspire and guide me. And I am one who did not think i needed any further inspiration or guidence. Wrong! I see a measurable difference in my understanding of myself and others, a strengthening of my will and a growth in my compassion and my ability to speak truth and discern falsehood in myself and others since ""attending"" your seminars.

I love how they’ll change their tune when they get the hotts for a good looking God fearing human. God, finding God, respecting religion, it’s given me so much purpose. I found that God speaks thru Irony. God is a storyteller of the finest kind. It’s an all natural enlightenment that unfolds over a lifetime & once you see some of this tailormade Irony, just for you, it’s a special kinda feeling. DNA is the most complex & intelligent component in nature. Science itself cannot wrap it’s big antiGod head around this code behind Life. SOMETHING programmed this puppy. Lastly, I wanna say...with all that science can explain it hasn’t disproved a God. Wouldn’t you rather lead a humble existence than put down the stronghold of the majority of good people?

So I tried answering the question how I interpret Peterson’s explanation. The question basically was: what did he mean when you confront your fear and then make a world out of it?

Alright, so let’s say I’m afraid of height, yes? Pretty common. The breathtaking view that a mountaintop offer is unknown to me personally. Sure, I can look at pictures but that doesn’t give you that elating feeling of being on top of something remarkably high and seeing the clouds at a great height. Seeing snaking roads and meandering rivers and trees so small your fingernails are bigger than them from where you’re standing.

However, if I do decide to go out and conquer my fear of heights and ultimately “slay the dragon,” as Peterson would have it, then that world becomes mine. It isn’t unknown to me anymore. And so I think that’s what he means of making a world out of your fear. It’s mapping out a foreign place, personally experience it, and making it a part of your reality. I can even extend the explanation further. Like, it’s not just my fear that I conquered but the physical effort that involves in conquering it. Or maybe all the factors needed in mastering that fear. Maybe I’m also afraid of traveling alone. Or maybe I’m socially awkward to join a group that has a proclivity in climbing heights and all the other big and small things involved into transforming that alien world into something that I have personal experience with.

I don’t know if I got it right but if I look at it this way it makes sense. For me, at least."

Maybe he should be more open minded and come to the Bible with the opposite mindset.  He should say... ok...the stories seem not rational to me, so let me study this and see if there is any evidence of this being the true word of God. I believe we are spiritual beings having a temporary, physical experience, not the other way around.  But, I used to think the same as him. I didn't think the stories of the Bible really happened or were from God.  I decided a few years ago to put my ideas aside and read the scriptures, and listen to theologians about the subject. I wanted to give the other perspective a chance.  I now feel the evidence is overwhelming for the existence of God and Christ.  The Bible when you really know it and study it makes perfect sense."

Wait a minute... ""christianity died of its own hand"" and ""produced the kind of mind that was capable of transcending its dogmatic foundations and concentrating on the natural world""? But... but... people already had that kind of mind centuries earlier. What about archimedes? Ancient greek astronomers? Nasir al din tusi? Ibn al nafis? Ibn al haytham?

How is it less reasonable to claim that religions in general obstructed the development of ""the kind of mind"" that would focus on the study of the natural world?"
Ugz2rgmGR5r0F0GfOrZ4AaABAg,Lo Fo,1524279688510,"I find it hard to believe in the theory of evolution that says that human beings come from chimpanzees.  I don’t share that theory.  I have been thinking about it, maybe I am wrong, or maybe another opinion will help me to clarify and learn more.
I do believe in evolution, but within the kind.  And I don’t think that one kind can give another kind.  And in a kind there are different species which can do evolve.
My question is if a chimpanzee was to turn into a human after million of years, why do we rely on sperm and eggs of human beings to create another human?  Also, if that was true, why don’t we see other “kinds” appearing through the years.  For example, if a chimpanzee evolves through million years into the human we are today, why other chimpanzees don’t become humans?  I don’t think that only one chimpanzee could evolve into a human, I believe that during that time there might have been chimpanzees of the same kind, loving in the same environment, thus maybe the same or similar outcomes should have happened.  Humans would not only come from fertilization, but also from evolution of chimpanzees, as well as any other kinds that exist on earth.  It would be a slow process for one of them, but I think that at least one human from evolution through chimpanzee could be seen today.  Or is it because the environment in which we live today is completely different?

God has made us in his image, that is, he has given us conscience
That this is a true enough of a construct that we mess with it at our peril

Because as our society throws away our old myths, we’re prone to give in to our baser nature and energies which resurrects chaos in our personal lives and in society as a whole.  In essence, that we are inviting a chaotic sea monster to emerge from our undisciplined psyche and threaten us all.

I personally suspect that the motivation for rejecting our old myths is not so much because we are any more rational or advanced as a species now than we were 60 years ago, but rather that by rejecting our old myths we allow ourselves to follow our base passion for hedonism.   

It may be interesting to consider that the ancient book of Judges records several instances of what happened to the ancient Israelites when they rejected their God in order to follow after hedonism in one form or another and we seem to be a modern instantiation of that phenomenon.  We may not have a physical temple to the idol Moloch, but we certainly have the sexual excess to mirror the temple prostitutes and similarities between abortion and the child sacrifices seem fairly self evident."

UgwhGs6Pn0HhcPyrYfV4AaABAg,youngthinker1,1524279693336,"I am glad he admits his own biases with this discussion. 
Something I would simply contribute; you can never make two religions meld together. One will always win your heart, and the other will be forsaken.
Christ put the idea more eloquently: You cannot serve two masters.

For evolution has become a religion, with fanatics that try to block discussion of weakness of the broad hypotheses push forth by the fanatics. So, no other religion will work with evolution, even science has started to fail. I would argue that the fanatics of evolution, compete with the fanatics of climate change in regards to overall fanaticism.

So, it makes sense to me that Dr. Peterson would draw incorrect ideas about God, because if he were to attempt to accept any of the claims God makes, then he would have to deny his own world view, (his axioms.) Which Dr. Peterson admitted earlier, ""If it (the Bible), does not conform to evolutionary truths, then it is false."" So, listening to him talk about this subject, tests my own knowledge on the Bible, and makes me question if I could logically answer his hypothesis. For that, I am thankful.

For those who make claims that evolution is science:
1. How do you reconcile spontaneous generation, the hypothesis that organic matter can be generated by inorganic matter, with your creation myth? 
For, in none of the experiments, in regards to the evolution's genesis hypothesis, conducted did life come about, instead the scientist assumed it would after a prolong period of time, basis off of the organic material created. This doesn't disprove the experiments conduct by Dr. Pasture, in the 1700's, that disproved spontaneous generation.
2. What tests are used to determine ancestors and descendants? If any were published, did they stand up to scrutiny? For, if you wish to make an assertion, then I would like to review it and see if it can be repeated. 
3. Does this hypothesis sound true: ""For every reaction, there is an accelerator, and decelerator."" Granted, this would have to be an axiom, because it would be impossible to prove. So, pray tell, can you assume something remain ""stable"" in a chaotic environment for extended periods of time? In order for evolution's genesis story to come about, different elements would have to disobey this hypothesis, then obey it later. That doesn't make sense to me.  An example of which is radioactive material: radiation can be accelerated by heat and pressure, and we have observed examples of radioactivity on Earth and in space. In the evolution's genesis story, the earth stays geologically active, with the tectonic plates, volcanoes forming and exploding, and other examples. Each one of these geological activities involves huge amounts of heat and pressure. So, which would be more likely? 
1. The radioactive isotopes had similar starting time points, but due each receiving different amounts of pressure and heat over a period of time, reached varied states of decay. 
or
 2. Each radioactive isotope had various starting time points, but ignored any changes in environment."

What if we re-think everything based on the more plausible premise of Creation, and no more than 8000 years of earthly existence?

The dreamer is an experiencer, the dream itself with its content a stimulus that induces the experience. We are not acting the dream, it seems to have a life of its own. Psychoanalysts are very interested in dreams because they may tell us something about underlying thought patterns and views of the world (I'm not a psychologist though, I just occasionally talk with my therapist about my dreams when I can remember them). The idea that dreams represent a body of unconscious knowledge is extremely interesting and thought-provoking.

The way they want to achieve that is through playing out the endtime prophecies via the geopolitical theater and divide and conquer strategies within cultures. It's also tied into the extraterrestrial/ancient aliens/annunaki propaganda they're spreading. That's why you're hearing so much about ufo disclosure in the alt media and possible life containing planets in the mainstream. That's why peterson hints at you that elohim is plural, meaning multiple gods, and if you know the theme of the alien rabbithole you'll understand that elohim=annunaki. It's an intricate social engineering web of disinformation to lead you to the overarching narrative. That is there's now a luciferian conspiracy playing out by the zionist/satanist/communist/postmodernist/feminist etc faction. That conspiracy will be defeated by putin and the brics and the darkness of the zionist west will ""end"". Putin will be aided by the propagated annunaki, who will be sold to us as our original creators/gods. After that there will be a couple of years of peace, after which putin will be revealed to be the antichrist and global persecution of dissidents by a ""reformed"" UN will follow. Judaism and islam will both be annihilated. In some shape or form they'll have jezus christ show up with his real ""angels"", another alien race, and he'll ""end"" the anti christ once and for all and humanity will end having been brainwashed and submitted to an insane class of ""elite"" criminals.

Dr. Peterson is such a powerful speaker because he's warning, he's crying out from his deepest self, and he's working himself to the bone trying, trying to warn. When you follow him closely you see this emotion and passion. He KNOWS he's right, and I think that's what moves people, us.

Ugy9RtV12uM_BBCSe3N4AaABAg,Phil Forster,1521601310196,"Hi Dr Peterson,

With your study of psychology and the Bible
I really feel that you would understand  and relate to my faith as Unitarian (One God - not a Trinity) Jesus being a mere man making his sacrifice of human nature an atonement to God His Father for where and why in scripture is there a requirement by God for a divine sacrifice? Yet man insists on a divine sacrifice and I've always wondered on the psychology of that.

Secondly I don't believe that Satan is a real supernatural devil, (Who gives him power and authority if he was) and read carefully Satan in scripture is just a personification of the evil that human nature can be. (Jews  themselves take this view too mostly)

Also Hell is what life can be and once we are dead that it unless we are baptized into Christ then we have the hope of resurrection

And the hope of the gospel is not that we float off to heaven with an 'immortal soul' (try finding those two words mentioned together, they're not) rather Christ will return to earth to set up his Kingdom and bring the much needed divine ability to heal the worlds ills

And finally there is absolute proof of Gods existence and ability in a simple study of eschatology - for instance our group of believers has been stating that Britain would leave the EU ever since they joined as its a requirement that they agree separate from the EU according to our very detailed and clear understanding of Eschatology and thats the tip of the ice berg of what is being fulfilled right before our eyes and already has been fulfilled.

Anyway I thank you for your amazing work and insights that you give especially into human nature which is all very spot on and pray that you see this message and consider the real truth found in scripture as opposed to the mainstream churches lies

What we see as common sense ideas like love and mercy are not to be found in the Christian sense, prior to Christ. This idea that all religions are the same at their core is verifiably false. Christianity can either be true or false, it is impossible for it to be both. If one wants to look at the Bible in an honest manner, they must be willing to question everything. They must be willing to put all assumptions under the microscope and test their truthfulness. In short, love truth,  seek it as if it were gold, desire it above all."

You find the most 5-HT2CA receptors there, which explains why people who've been exposed to chronic stress are excessive ruminators. Meditation dampens and, with enough hours, completeley rewires the default mode of your brain. You can take inositol to suppress 5-HT2CA receptors in the brain, which explains it's mood lifting effects. Obviously stress reduction and meditation will also help tremendously. All outwardly expressed behaviours depend on emotional states that are the result of neurochemistry and brain plasticity. Don't be fooled into believing that your ""character"" dictates how you feel and behave. Attain the optimal lifestyle first, because it's not only what you eat, but also what you do that nourishes you either negatively or positively. It's all circumstance, environment and lifestyle. On a side note, the antidepressants jordan peterson always recommends also work by up or down regulating neurotransmitter receptors. Suicide victims have , among other things, upregulated 5HT2CA receptors. Messing with these drugs and receptors can cause effects like thoughts of suicide or the idea to shoot up a school. Why? Because of severe imbalancing of neurotransmitters and receptors pe in the default mode network of people under chronic stress. It's a vicious cycle of self perpetuating thoughts that increase stress and thus increase receptors to deal with that stress and so on. Taking mdma also causes a brief period of downregulated and then upregulated serotonin receptors(suicide tuesday anyone?). St johns wort is known to cause suicidal thoughts with prolonged use. Again brief down regulation, long term upregulation. Mess with your neurochemistry at your own risk!"

Ugy44L6KVICP5zUX17Z4AaABAg,Chris Wagner,1521601312545,"Mr Peterson, your understanding of the human mind, your articulation of such coupled with the emotive way in which you relay this information makes you a great help for people dealing with their own subconscious and conscious psyche. I would agree with your analysis of how religion and dogma has an effect on a person's mental health, being in many ways, in a stable person, healthy, and in many further ways dangerous in an unstable person. What I would like to mention is that in fact that these propositions for healthy mental behaviour have been analysed and to an exorbitant been dealt with by this book, the bible, quite a while prior to any correlation could have been made between mental health and certain moralities. To elaborate I believe the state of the western world, as Nietzsche has predicted for Western civilisation, is quite unequivocally linked to the  loss of the reason for such ""moral behaviour"" i.e. healthy psychological behaviour. I believe that if you can outline the logical bases for a need for this morality apart from a belief in God, you will have created quite an important philosophical ethic, which in my mind no one has truly been able to do, from Hume to Kant to Nietzsche, who, let's not forget eventually succumbed to mental illness and in his final year was reciting biblical verses he had learned during childhood.

UgwJjkuqRvknj1NtjoZ4AaABAg,The May Farm,1521601314288,"""In the beginning there was the Word..."" In my own mystical experiences, this is the revelation of how I co-create heaven or hell on earth every moment. It is the divine prescription for the manifestation of everything and the divine diagnosis for our ills.  That is why I need to be so careful about giving my word, choosing my words. I realize that they have the power, as JP asserts, to tilt the world towards heaven or hell. To lie weakens the power of one's word. To keep one's word increases its power and the degree to which what one ""says"" is made manifest. If we are made in this image and Creation is ongoing, the big question is What am I Creating? One thing I have alway wondered, is why Genesis skipped over Thought.  ""In the Beginning"" there would be the Thought, the Idea, right?  It is our Thoughts that become Words, Deeds, Manifestations, for better or for worse. I love how JP is figuring this out on the spot, preparing the ground for divine Inspiration, boldly setting a table for it, trusting it to come. I'm going to do the same with this question and see if it gets answered. Hmm. Now I'm wondering if the power of Intention precedes Thought. I think if I stick with this Intuitive Guidance Reality TV show, I might find out. JP is a good spokesperson with a brilliant mind but this sort of thing is available by virtue of being human to those who seek Truth and desire Truth above all. Turning toward the Divine, Indwelling, with burning questions, setting the table, trusting,  adopting an attitude of ""Surprise me"" ... JP is bold enough to do all that out loud on a stage in front of an audience. Right on."
Ugw5II4dXsuu5graF2Z4AaABAg,Richard Aaron,1521601314302,"You remind me more of a philosopher than anything which is why I like you so much and I don't mean like modern philosophers but like the ones who haven't existed for hundreds of years such as Arthur Schopenhauer or Blaise Pascal and that is really the best compliment I could give anyone. It's so apparent that you love knowledge and wisdom, I doubt I would have ever found your books (unless they are found in the Philosophy or World History sections of the store) but thankfully I did find you on Youtube and now know about your books.  

Edit: Not 5 minutes in and you are talking about Friedrich Nietzsche which is funny because The Anti-Christ was the first philosophy book I ever read and I couldn't stop laughing the entire time I read the book because it was like Nietzsche was yelling at me when I read it. I however disagreed with his philosophy that compassion is a weakness and if you feel compassion it means you yourself are weak. However I do believe there is undeniable truth in the Will to Power. I am personally more of a Socrates/Plato subscriber and I only say both names because really I have no idea if Plato came up with much of what I believe or his teacher Socrates did since Socrates never wrote anything down. I'm not religious (at least I don't believe in prophets or that God had a son on Earth) but have studied all of the world religions because I am hungry for knowledge and I do believe there most likely is a God or Creator but we are unable to know what that is.

Edit 2: Now that I apply ""compassion is a weakness and if you feel compassion it means you yourself are weak"" to the Far Left, I do actually see his point and how visionary he was. I think when I read the book 15 years ago though, the statement seemed too broad but now when I listen to you and I apply to the correct people, it does make sense and it seems to be true when speaking of the Far Left. I still don't believe my compassion is a weakness though, I see my compassion as a virtue.

Edit 3: Almost 20 minutes and you just surprised the hell out of me. There was a point in my life when I was reading tons and tons of World History (Herodotus as a good example) and Philosophy (Schopenhauer, Pascal and Plato) and Eastern Philosophy/Religion (Tao Te Ching, Confucius) but I was also taking drugs and at that time in my life I felt more in touch with what at that time I called The Will of The Universe but it was indeed a very religious experience and I felt like I had a direct connection to whatever is controlling things in this Universe. I was never sure what it was that made me feel that way, it was like a warm feeling in my stomach combined with a happiness that is only felt by making new connections in the brain, an intellectual happiness. I tried reading those books again and I tried drugs again but nothing ever put me back in touch with whatever I was feeling and it wasn't just a feeling, it was something real, it made me able to predict things that would happen and it really freaked people out that I could do that. My friends especially the people in my prog rock band called me a prophet many times and said I scared the hell out of them. I know it sounds insane and unbelievable but I have so many witnesses to it that unless everyone is a figment of my imagination then this really happened and is verifiable. My question is, if it was drugs (and I do believe it was since you just pretty much confirmed it for me by describing exactly the feeling), then why don't drugs do that to me now? It only worked for a short period of time a decade or so ago and I can't recreate it.

Edit 4: This dream you are talking about sounds so much like Arthur Schopenhauer, are you sure Freud didn't get it from him? Being that Schopenhauer was German and Freud I believe was a Jewish person living in Germany (I'm not studied on Freud by any means but I believe I read that) it's very possible Freud was influenced by Schopenhauer's philosophy is it not? Schopenhauer said things like ""Life is a dream and when we wake up we will be in a real life and that life will be no less suited to our existence than this one""  I am paraphrasing that part but he also said  “If the immediate and direct purpose of our life is not suffering then our existence is the most Ill-adapted to its purpose in the world: for it is absurd to suppose that the endless affliction of which the world is everywhere full, and which arises out of the need and distress pertaining essentially to life, should be purposeless and purely accidental. Each individual misfortune, to be sure, seems an exceptional occurrence; but misfortune in general is the rule.” which I am not paraphrasing. Seriously if you haven't read Essays and Aphorisms by Arthur Schopenhauer I think you'd be shocked by how much of his philosophy you already know if you did just like I was and things you didn't already know you'd probably agree with like I did. I know it's different than what you talking about but I wonder what connections your brain would make between the works of Freud and Schopenhauer."

I'm an atheist who has read Crime and Punishment, and I understand it's easy to say God bestowed the individual with a sacred meaning reinforced through human interaction, such as Raskolnikov's murder of the old woman and his intrinsic change following the murder. However, it's just as easy to say this divinity had nothing to do with a higher power, and we have bestowed it upon ourselves, through thousands of generations of physical and mental development. The human mind is infinitely complex in its self-interested workings and capacity for empathy. We (generally) see the value of a human life as far greater than nearly anything this world has to offer. This meaning doesn't necessarily need to have been bestowed upon us by something greater, as we have made ourselves the greatest being on this planet. We are our own God, which I know is a post-modernist position, but it's admittedly one of the few which have some credence."

I became a Christian about 8 years ago and I am quite amazed that in some sense you have come closer to the truth in your study of the Bible than many Christians. :) That makes sense, because if The Bible is given by the Author of human psychology, as the handbook, then it is logical that we find such deep lessons - in my view - orcherstrated by the loving omnipotent Creator to help us to get back to our original home. :)

Anyway, I'd like to also point out a factual mistake that I believe you make in this lecture. You say that the Son is a scapegoat, but actaully He is not. The scapegoat is Satan. You will see this in Lev 16 where two goats are selected on the day of atonement.

One is sacrificed - that goat symoblizes Jesus - the Son's death redeems humanity. The other one is sent to wilderness to die.

The day of atonement symbolizes the final judgment and the final cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven (cleansing of our sins). Although Jesus paid for us, it will not be the end of it. Satan will also pay for everything he has caused and the scapegoat symbolizes just that.

Scapegoat and redeemer are not the same. They are the opposite. Although very similar in appearance. Redeemer is sacrificed, the scapegoat is not."

Our soul dies and our bodies turn to dust but ""God"" remembers those who are eternal.
Forgetting God's admonition Eve gave to Adam to eat to forget God.  The last Adam, Christ, gave to his disciples to eat in remembrance. It's an exact reversal and after they ate the last supper they were in a garden being tempted..  Going back before Eve and Adam ate to where Eve was made Christ was put into a deep sleep and his side was opened and a helps meet made for him.

Ugz-OZ7q7fzWSw0-JrZ4AaABAg,Doug Ribot,1519182127054,"""God"" is the power/intelligence/love that dwells in the eternal ultimate (as contrasted by relative) non things that define all things.
3 aspects of eternal non thing I am aware of are ultimate stillness, silence and darkness (ie non wave) or in Biblical terms ""the kingdom/reign of God""  ""that flesh and blood can not inherit"".

Relative stillness would be you are sitting still but the car is moving in relation to you but you are spinning in relation to earth's axis...  Ultimate would be the sun is still in relation to the planets it defines but it dies moving in the universe and somewhere there is an ultimate stillness that defines all motion (but it is reflected behind what all matter is made of -- another story).

Matter is made from time.  The only difference between one thing and another is numbers of frequencies, waves ...
The river of pre-time force meets resistance and clots into whirlpools of matter.  As the river's water passes the spinning water keeping it spinning the river becomes time in relation to the matter it created but matter can not go back to the pre time.
Jesus constantly reflected that intelligence/power/love and therefore was not subject to environment but it was subject to him. 
Satan was cast out of the ultimate heaven.  
Sound is temporal but stillness that defines sound, the flat line the sound wave goes above and below, remains after the sound is gone.  It is greater and defines.  You can demonstrate sound, do something to make it but not silence but it is and ultimate silence is eternal.  You can not DO something to make silence.
Satan can reflect off the temporal things of motion but has no rest in the ultimate eternal non things where the power/intelligence/love of ""God"" dwells.
Even if you tried to define stillness by motion you would have to go faster and faster to define each relative stillness and like Einstein pointed out with rockets -- the faster they go the slower time gets.  If you reached the speed where time stopped you'd be in that same place of non thing.  Either relativity carried to its ultimate conclusion ends up in the same place.

For any Christians who have a hard time with my description of heaven including ultimate darkness. --
1 Kings 8:12  Then Solomon said, O Lord, thou hadst said that thou wouldst dwell in the thick darkness.
2 Chronicles 6: 1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
Psalm 18:  9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.  11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
Psalm 97:2  Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
Deuteronomy 4:11  And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
Job 38:19   Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,  20  That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
2 Corinthians 11
13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

Jordan Peterson made me realize that I was affronted by the claims of literalist sections of religious thought and that I had detached any perception of meaning from religion due to this, opposing religion through the materialist hyper rational lens rather than addressing it on it's own terms. Proving the existence or non existence of a superior godly being is irrelevant to the meaning that can be derived from the very idea of such a thing and both atheist and zealot have, in my mind, completely missed the point of the whole enterprise. Jordan Peterson lays it out very well and I am convinced now that Religion is the manifestation of the collective unconscious within human society, the most complex and strongly laid out stage for the drama of human existence and a deep insight into the meaning to be derived from that existence.

Jordan Peterson has dragged me back from the abyss of nihilism and dreadful despair from whence I had descended over the course of a decade. His books and lectures have brought a sense of meaning and pride to my life and I can say with some certainty that he has made me wish to live."

God's will vs freewill.

You have two towns each with ten people.

In the first town 9/10 people refuse to follow the righteous path (their moral compass, the voice in their head, their conscience). They are liars, unjust, hateful, cruel, merciless etc.

Each individual made the individual choice to behave this way. Each person contributes as an individual toward the majority. The majority behavior decides outcome. So this place becomes a terrible town to live in.

In the other town 9/10 people follow their moral compass and refuse to stray. They are honest, compassionate, patient, restrained, protective of the weak, and just.

Again each individual made a choice..  But because 9/10 of them chose to be good people with every fiber of their being... They contributed to the place being a great place to live. The majority behaves well.

The will of God is then the preset outcomes of both choices. You choose to behave like the people in the first town..  You will create a town of suffering. That is preset. It will NEVER be a good place even if you lie and say it is. And if you behave in the way of the good town... It will always be a great place no matter how many times you claim it isn't. That is God's will.

Freewill is the choice to behave one way or the other."

God = 1 (a whole, the entirety, the grand total)

UgwiJf1viOhyYSFhYGV4AaABAg,Eystein Thanisch,1519182133955,"This is a highly stimulating and erudite lecture. However, there seems to be a problem. Around 1:13:00, with reference to the massively hyperlinked Bible, Peterson sets out the postmodernist argument that the universe is so complex that no one can know what the correct interpretation of it is. He then responds that no one can live with such a philosophy and that we need basic truths and a basic mythology in order to function as humans. In other words, he doesn't dispute the truth of the postmodernist view (i.e. he doesn't dispute that truth is unattainable) but claims that we should try and pretend otherwise because it's good for us. This highly anthropocentric view seems much more relativistic than that of the postmodernists, who say we should simply face up to our confusion about the universe, even if it isn't good for us (no one said life was going to be easy etc.). And this kind of purposeful dishonesty seems very close to the exact sort of thing that Dr Peterson very convincingly condemns elsewhere in his works. In other words, I am not sure whether Peterson the philosopher (raising important questions) and Peterson the clinician (providing pragmatic solutions) quite join up. Or have I misunderstood?"

We love you, keep doing what you are doing and know that you are not the only one that seemingly questions everything. Refuse always to accept the control of others who seek to manipulate the Knowledge to stop your progress by turning it into comfort. Your soul is on fire and will never be quenched and that is not a bad thing. Your fire will one day spark a revolution where we will understand the nature of the Human Experience and the provenance of consciousness.

War and peace. Love and hate. Selfishness and selflessness. The individual versus the group. The prophets. The teachers. The dreamers. Peterson is talking about ""The Dream"" as the realm of thought that connects the mundane to the divine. The known and the unknown. The middle ground between two very different planes of existence. The question burning in my mind now is, did God supply those archetypes in the Bible as a way to help us bridge the gap between our mind and His? Our existence and His? Did the events of the Bible happen naturally of their own accord or did they unfold as a result of God's divine ordinance as a way to help us see the patterns of the universe and use those patterns to elevate our lives to a higher level?

To me, religion and ideologies for that matter, seem like compact packets of thought for those who don’t want to or know how to approach philosophical questions themselves. In other words, you don’t have to base your ethics and moral on the notion that something divine is backing it up, it was people in the first place who thought about these things enough to write it down. In a way, I feel the god-argument undermines the human ingenuity. 

These “universal truths” that emerge from time are formed just like science from thinking and empirical evidence, in this case also from biology and many other social phenomena. Describing them is, in essence, processing things in the light of the thoughts and findings of the ones before us reflecting on your own findings. Amazing yes, but not supernatural to the slightest. The state of ethics could be very different if human species was different. 

I also think there is nothing divine about dreams, as in individual dreams. Things you process in your sleep derive from yourself and your surroundings, nowhere else. Saying that dreams are divine because they can be complex is like saying computers are magic because you don’t understand how they work. Believing dreams or hallucinations as reaching the divine is just silly superstition.

Alex Kierkegaard: ""Weak people need the old religions, for what are they to do in their hours of greatest weakness? They need an interpretation of existence that relieves their suffering. This interpretation must be based on a model of the universe, a schematic of the rest of the universe outside themselves, and this schema will of course be greatly simplified. All models are simplifications anyway, and given that we are talking about weak people here (which means: slow in the head and/or body, but above all in the head, since our species' greatest strength is intelligence) theirs will be an especially simplified model; an absurd caricature of reality, when all is said and done; a grossly simplified and exaggerated image of it, but still nevertheless an image of it, which is to say a view of the universe from a certain perspective. And just as a mole's view of the forest is extremely murky and basic and simple while an imaging satellite's is vastly clearer and more complex — but still depicts the same object nevertheless: the forest, and hence is by no means entirely dissociated from reality — is not a ""pure fantasy"" in other words, and certainly contains an amount of truth in it and useful information, such that for someone who had seen the satellite data and had the capacity to parse it and who was then given an image of the mole's viewpoint, he could identify, if he was perceptive enough, that yes, they depict the same forest, and here is a clump of trees that is common to both viewpoints, only at a different resolution and viewed from different angles, so will the philosopher treat the old religions' particular beliefs, examining each in turn and pronouncing them extremely murky and simplistic, yes, but still ultimately true, when all is said and done. 
   To find the truth in religion — in the old religions, which is to say those extremely simplistic and grossly exaggerated absurd caricatures of philosophical systems that our ancestors constructed and which are so outdated that no one believes in them (i.e. no one uses them) anymore: that is a task that only an Overman can tackle. For everyone else sees nothing there: they only see a joke. But it is the understanding of common people that to an Overman is a joke, and the greatest joke is their obstinate, unthinking hazing of philosophy and religion (which is to say of thought)."""

Peterson seems to believe that all drives and outcomes are totally ""natural"" and not distorted by environmental conditions. But powerful people, usually rich and/or secure are different, as F.Scott Fitzgerald rightly judged: they are and have been usually ruthless and have imposed their values on those not in a position to fight back. Organized religion  began or was used  in the same way, and it's not an accident that temporal power and organized religion reinforce each other. It's also quite unChristian or, more precisely, unJesus.  Ideology, the way Peterson uses the term, is inseparable from human life, but he seems to think it is unique to socialism and communism. Naive: there is nothing so ideological as Capitalism and its latest form, neoliberalism, where all human values and protections  are cancelled out or subsumed in favour of corporate profit. Even libertarianism is ideological.t's not lack of religion, either, or the death of God, that caused so much chaos, but the endless stream of wars, usually forwarded on the basis of a putative God's will that the putative enlightened force their exceptional and holy values on those unable to fight against them. And I'm not talking about non-gendered pronouns. Did you mark George W. Bush's conversation with God just before he hit Iraq? and that was the second cruel, unjust, unreasonable war against it.

UgziXZsTeof5NDbscTt4AaABAg,Christopher Rivera,1519182175608,"Nietzsche thought the death of god was terrible and dangerous and yet something to be cheerful about. Terrible for the reason you brought up of destructive ideologies and nihilism. Nietzsche valued amor fati above all: to affirm everything, even decadence and decadent religions (to make your greatest fear also your greatest hope is what he calls the tragic pathos, part of his ideal). And he was cheerful because the death of god, the destruction of morality's veto from reason meant it was time for a Revaluation of all values and the belief in the overman as the new god, the god man creates and is himself a part of (genetic and cybernetic enhancements will undoubtedly take part in this). ""How to become what one is"", how will ( =psychological force) becomes power ( =physical force), the ideal becomes the real. Nietzsche: ""Indeed we philosophers and 'free spirits' feel, when we hear the news that 'that the old god is dead,' as if a new Dawn shone on us; our heart overflows with gratitude""... (Gay Science).

UgzWU3ir7rbwy3LJS7Z4AaABAg,levcimac,1519182175735,"This lecture fails to set the conceptual framework necessary that I believe Peterson would have aimed for if, it seems, he wasn't as limited by his academic background (I believe he has the motivation to go down into the rabbit hole). I think that his framework lacks depth precisely because he chooses to think practically and as a utilitarian (see 'My Approach' at 1:04:57). The problem is that he is trying to grapple with the transcendent and the immanent aspects of consciousness, that is, the manifest universe and the subtle and formless worlds. His favoured principles of rationality, practicality and utility are useful as far as you are dealing with things at the level of the material, cultural and societal. However the idea of God presumably transcends these realms even while embracing them in some unseen way. It is a shame because it seemed as if, in first hour of this lecture, he was on track to demonstrate his own way of understanding the mystery of the world and explaining it to his audience.

I will listen to more of his lectures since his articulation and passion may reveal new insights. However, I would love to see Peterson collaborating in some way with Michael Meade who is a gifted story teller, student of mythology and Jungian scholar, and as a way of explaining the contemporary life with a mythic imagination that transcends whilst including the rational.

Another philosopher who I highly recommend listening to is Ken Wilber and his explanation of Integral Theory, a sort of theory of everything. His magnus opus 'Sex, Ecology and Spirituality' is mind-blowing and references the major thinkers, mystics and scholars from East and West.

UgyglSYT3QsbYSUyojx4AaABAg,Goattacular,1519182175748,"At the end there about the value of original art, or artifacts in general, I would concur. As a blade collector and weapon enthusiast, I have many weapons, but my most treasured ones are those that were actually in historical battles, and one of them I know for a fact was used to take at least one if not many human knives by the US soldier who used it while defending himself in a foxhole that was being overrun during the Vietnam War. It's a fairly cheap Edge Brand model 473 circa 1968 German hunting knife, and you can find them on e-Bay for about $10. However, the known history associated with it makes it historically more valuable, as it seems to resonate a sense of awe and uneasiness with anyone who holds it and realizes why it's stained in blood, literally and figuratively. You don't get that with a reproduction, or even a photo of it. It's like you can tell it was really used to take life.

I've found that those who hold it without knowing the history become uneasy and are quick to set it back down, whereas my actual military KA-BAR knives that have never seen combat don't have that effect. I suspect human suffering is somehow imprinted on objects in the world, and our subconscious can pick up on that somehow. I have no idea why. The same phenomena happens to some people who visit a location where a particularly gruesome, violent death occurred. It's occasionally described as a sixth sense, but I suspect it's tied to whatever systems we use to detect threats, picking up on ques that are invisible to our conscious mind."

Ugzpu2gdLjNnFEcWZ994AaABAg,Fester7960,1519182183848,"I used to be an atheist/Darwinist, but at some point found it unsustainable.

For example...evolution is the unguided, unscripted, and unconscious process where time plus matter plus condition produces a result. Stimulus and response over millions, or billions of years. There's no mind behind it, no conscious celestial influence.

But that's the problem. If all I am is the result of random forces distilling themselves over time, forces that neither know nor care, then why should I believe what they tell me?

Also, ask anyone what the end result of evolution is and you will always get the same answer. Bottom line, it's about survival. Creatures come and go, change and adapt according to whatever challenges they are presented with. But when you come to man you see something different. Here we are, supposedly the apex of evolved creatures on this planet, and yet we do more than any other creature to extinguish ourselves. And the more we go on, the more dangerous the world becomes.

Peterson here is a big fan of Jung, and I can understand why. Jung told the story about how one time he went out into the country to observe some sheep. It occurred to him that there in that naturalistic environment he could be aware of the sheep, and they were aware of him too. But there was a difference. The sheep were aware of him only to the extent that they could see him. Jung was aware of the fact that through him nature could see itself. So if something greater can observe something lesser, and we know it, then why is it so hard to believe that we ourselves are also being observed?"

He is literally above the universe and is greater than it. He is all-Seeing, all-Hearing, all-Knowing, all-Powerful. He is Just and Wise. He is Merciful, and He loves pious people. He forgives sins, He accepts repentance, and although He is severe in punishment, He is very Forbearing.
He created man in His image, with His two blessed Hands, and commanded that he worship Him alone without any partner. Nothing is equal to Him. He has no partner and no son, but is One and Only.
This is the belief of all the Prophets of God, including Moses, Jesus and Mohammad.

Christians, come back to this simple truth. Worship the One God above and do not say, Three. It is better for you.
Pagans, leave your idols and turn back to the One who created you and all that which you do.
Atheists and agnostics, this is the only rational choice. It is God who created you, after you were nothing, out of the humblest of beginnings.
Accept God and He will dignify you, in this world and the next.

This seems like a rationalization of a process that I believe is more likely to have been the happening due to to arbitrary factors as the opinions of the people that happened to be in power when such tribes collided/colluded.

women and children , pestilence..one could even add that Hitler Stalin and Mao to name a few got all their ideas
...the bad ones from that book and amplified ad finished the creation or the desecration. 
The Bible has some good human stories as well, too bad nobody reads or very few indeed read that book.
The other problem is that the Bible is preached by people who don't know the actual language it was written in
They preach on the basis of translations, and the codex we have is not the original one.
We don't know anything about the Bible
We don't know who wrote it, when it was written, how it was written originally, or how it was read.
We have a codex, which is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.
Jewish Biblical scholars and professors in Jewish Universities in Israel, say with certitude that the Bible today
is not the same as the Bible which was written originally.
We pretend it is. Theologians pretend that the Bible talks about God and they are very generous in this pretense.
This book is been in literary flux for a few centuries and Peterson may joke that it wasn't edit by a commitee
but it certainly looks that way. I agree with his argument about being the foundation of Western culture and society
but very problematic at best. The only honest intellectual approach to have with the Bible is to pretend.
What if anything is honestly true in the Bible are those things which the Bible shares with the other peoples in the general
neighborhood who also wrote ancient texts. The Bible contains some things.
When the Bible landed with the Pharisees they changed the texts to reflect in the Bible that there is a possibility
of life after death. When the Bible landed with the Sadducees : the priest class, they said that the soul, angels and resurection
don't exist, there is nothing after death and they were the priest class. Its in the New Testament , the Acts of the Apostles
plainly written, they complain about it, no Fake leftist or rightist news. The Bible could very well be a mountain of scrotum salt .
The Bible contains some things. So what do we do with the premises of this book...land it in the recycling sack?
The problem is, we know what was built on the back of this book for good or bad or people to get all so hysterical about
or to offend someone's sensibilities. Our system of government, and actual financial system is built on that book...its 
precisely described and applied to perfection and we are subject to it, so yes its really important and worthwhile to actually read what is written in that book over and above anything else they are telling us that is in that book."

UgzOPI2DrJu8RywLb6h4AaABAg,Tom,1516503796160,"PETERSON IS SAYING THAT GOD IS AN EVOLVED COMPONENT OF HUMAN NEUROLOGY?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Jordan Peterson is saying that God is a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Peterson is NOT repeating the old saying that God is just a ""figment of your imagination.""  Rather, he's saying that God is much more than a thought or a imagine in the human brain.  

Peterson is saying that God is NOT something learned from culture or constructed by culture or invented by humans (that's the claim of Marxists, Postmodernists, Atheists Activists).  

Rather, Peterson is saying that God is actually a component of human neurology.  

He's saying that God is in our DNA.  

To put this in terms of computers, Peterson is saying that God is NOT software that is added to some or many brains, but is actually built into the hardware of the brain.  

Thus, I think Peterson is saying that we humans have always told stories about God (as found in the Bible, and in other myths and legends) because the concept of God is hardwired into human brains.  

And Peterson believes that this God thing evolved in the human brain in order to enable humans to survive, prosper, reproduce, and have offspring who survive and reproduce.  

For this reason, Peterson believes that acknowledgment or appreciation of God, and obedience to the moral directives of God, are just important in the current time as they have ever been in the past.  And this is why Peterson is so opposed to people who strive to suppress God (i.e., the atheist activists).  

Have I correctly understood Dr. Peterson on this matter?

And if I have correctly understood him, am I not justified in being flabbergasted and shocked?  

Why flabbergasted and shocked?  

Because it seems that, deep down, Dr. Peterson is agreeing with atheists that there is no deity literally existing outside of the human brain.  That's shocking, to me anyway.  That means that Peterson sees the universe, outside the human brain, as genuinely godless.  

As such, I think Peterson's beliefs fit the classic, technical definition of ""atheist"" (someone who thinks deities do not exist outside the human brain). 

Peterson is saying that God exists; he exists in our DNA and in our brain.  

Peterson does NOT teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  Peterson is well aware that some people still believe in this old-fashioned concept of God, and he isn't particularly interested in leading them out of that belief and into Peterson's concept of God.  He believes the old-fashioned believers still get all the survival benefits from God.  

Some old-fashioned Christians say that God concept is in our DNA because God put Himself there.  But that's NOT what Peterson teaches.  Peterson says that natural biological evolution, NOT any supernatural deity, put the God concept in our DNA.  Peterson is a scientist, not a supernaturalist.  

All this makes Peterson a really strange bird:  An person who is technically an atheist who is also a fervent defender and promoter of God and religion.  

I know Peterson does this with the concept of the ""true myth,"" which apparently he borrowed from Carl Jung.  Perhaps Peterson also borrows the ""power of myth"" concept from Joseph Campbell.  

I also know that Dr. Peterson adds little caveats, such as the doesn't know everything, and there could be realities pertaining to God that are unseen by him.  But in saying this, I think he merely saying what any scientist says regarding the subject matter he studies, which is that there is always more to know.  I don't think Peterson is saying that he thinks all or any of the miracles described in the Bible or in the Koran actually happened (e.g., Jesus raised from the dead; parting of the Red Sea; the flood sent by God that killed everything except Noah and the people and animals on his ship) 

I suppose this unique theory of God is why some people regard Peterson as a genius.  

But couldn't this unique theory of God also reasonably lead other people to view Peterson as a madman?

Some old-fashioned Christians are seeing Peterson as being not quite a Christian, but as nevertheless a very supportive and ally to the Christian cause.  And they harbor hopes that Peterson will go ""full Christian"" at some point soon.

But some old-fashioned Christians are seeing Peterson as a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" as a godless fake Christian who is a ferocious enemy of the true God and of true Christians.

If I have misunderstood Peterson, please add a reply to correct me.  Thank you.

(P.S.#1 Dear fans of JBP:  I am not trying to interfere with or disparage Dr. Peterson's work. I respect the freedom of religion of Dr. Peterson and his fans.   I am, above all, just trying to do what any good student tries to do:  gain a deep understanding of a subject matter.  I have watched over a hundred of JBP videos, and have for a long time had a hard time grasping what he's really saying about God.  This morning I woke up, and felt that I had flash of insight about what he's really saying. )

(P.S.#2:  I often do feel that Dr. Peterson is trying to ""pull a fast one,"" is engaging in ""sleight of hand"" (legerdemain), in seemingly trying to make people think that his natural, impersonal, non-thinking, non-acting, biological DNA-based God is the same as thing as the supernatural, person-being, acting and thinking God depicted in the Bible.  They are similar, I admit.  But the same thing?  I don't think so.  Scholars are supposed to be careful in making necessary distinctions.  But it seems like, on this point, JBP's aim is to obscure distinctions that most people view as vital.)"

Lets put it this way, if you went to the horse racing track and met a man that told you all the winning horses that raced that day (lets say 5 horses ) and they all won just as he said, you would likely return and search to find him again so that you could put a lot of money on the next races and win big bucks right? Now imagine that you do this every race day till you have won 2,000 races straight in a row. That is exactly what the bible already has done by knowing the future long before it actually happens, this is just one of the way's that GOD the author of it proves it is true. Now imagine that some family and friends that heard of your experience, can't believe that it is true, how would you explain it to them??? The greatest reward that trumps any other, is to live forever in paradise beyond your imagination with no war, famine, disease, sickness, evil or corrupt people, no taxes, or any type of unhappiness, and in perfect health forever.

UgzFVP2EEjobIMoMqRF4AaABAg,James Andresen,1516503796195,"Prior to ""God is dead"", there were many examples of man's actions, both within/without religious belief in God, which influenced man's belief systems and provided for psychological/socialization stability. I would suggest that the substitution of a belief system to scientific principals does not necessarily destroy the psychological, or social, fabric necessary for human tranquility. Man is quite capable of living a happy fulfilled life while not having all the answers to the existence of the universe. ""I don't know"", is a perfectly acceptable answer. One must suppose that man, in his early history, before religion, was able to navigate his existence by either arresting his investigation into a realm beyond the physical or provided another rationalization for things that go bump in the night. Perhaps he was too busy in just surviving and making allies of other tribes to expand his power base. So, even though the shock that denying God does not necessarily scar the psyche to the point that man needs to accept something equally unprovable or to ferret out a solution to keep believing in the supernatural. Much of how one looks at their place in the universe has to do with the trust they had in their teachers during their formative years and the values of the belief systems which were taught to them. Yes, many a person's trusts in those they held dear were destroyed upon learning the truth of Santa Clause. It can be a slow, often painful process to acchiving the reality of things.  Having said that, I do believe that there is comfort in the belief in God, but then there is an equal discomfort as well."

Ugw9K2HjoR84nNeuHTJ4AaABAg,Dan O'Seaghdha,1516503796208,"I think what Dr. Peterson might enjoy ... and I'm saying this completely as a student of Textual Criticism, and an ordained Teacher of the Bible ( which to be fair would denote that I actually have a belief in God, a rational belief in God, but also follow the Bible as an adherent ) ... is examining some of his own prejudices regarding the Bible.  Prejudices is a bad word actually.  ""Prejudices"" denotes that there is some hidden confirmation bias that Dr. Peterson is seeking to justify, and I don't think that's the case at all.  It appears to more of a search for truth.  Perhaps a better way to phrase my statement would be:  Examine just a few of his own axioms regarding the Bible that he stated in the video.  For example:  "" Is the God of the Old Testament often Cruel and Arbitrary IN CONTRAST with the God of the New Testament ? ? "" (As said around 25 minutes or so) ( ""New Testament"" and ""Old Testament"" being corrupted linguistic constructions actually but that has more to do with linguistics )  I don't think anything could be further from the truth when you take the book in it's entirety.  You have a God in the Old Testament that pleads with people for 1,780 years in one case (The Flood) to change their ways or the result will be societal implosion ... 430 years in another case (Ammonite Depravity) ... 400 years in another incident (Pre-Exillic Israel).  A God of the Old Testament that instructs a new nation: "" Ok, these are your national borders.  YOU MAY NOT invoke a first strike against any of the nations around you.  Besides, you are related to them in a tribal way.  So learn to live with them in a civil manner.  These are the rules for warfare, if they attack you first.  Then yes, IF THEY ATTACK YOU FIRST ... you bring a vengeance upon them that will make them ever think twice about instituting an attack against you again "" (Deuteronomy).  A God of the Old Testament (Israelite Scriptures) that says a Prostitute (Rahab) may be forgiven to the extent that she become an ancestor of the King of Israel (David) (and eventually in the Greek Scriptures of our Common Era ... of Jesus himself) ... King David ... that is to be lauded for all time as a incredibly sinful man, that tried to correct his errors.  A God of the Old Testament (Israelite Scriptures) that states a Molech Worshipping woman, can also become an ancestor of King David (Ruth).  A God of the Old Testament (Israelite Scriptures) that states when war is to be conducted you MUST give warning to a city before it is attacked, and allow these people to capitulate ( Yeah, people always leave that part out but also forms a basis for the Rules of Warfare practiced in the 17th and 18th centuries ) And then a God of the New Testament (Greek Scriptures) that instructs individuals that if a person is unrepentant about Gross behaviors that they will not change and correct after opportunity after opportunity?  Cut them out of your life.  Completely and totally.  Have nothing to do with them and do not even eat food with them Be it your Mother or Father or Son or Daughter ... dont even say hello to them ... (Matthew, 1st Corinthians, Johns final letters).  A God of the New Testament (Greek Scriptures) that states when God will war with a world gone mad, he will bring the Blood of his enemies, and make it as deep as the withers of a horse while raining 250 pounds rocks on their head.  .... .... .... My point being that this entire axiomatic approach of a God of the ""Old Testament"" (I hate that term simply because it perpetuates archaic ideologies) is ""cruel and vengeful"" and the God of the ""New Testament"" is always ""kind and loving and you forgive everything"" finds absolutely no support in any meaningful way  ..... .... And my point is saying the forgoing, is to state that if you start to examine axioms that are accepted by society as ""true"" when they not be?  It becomes very surprising to see what else ""falls out"" on the floor, and what new Truths can be wrestled to the forefront of your mind.  And note, that I did not say:  "" Is XYZ account found in the book of ABC a "" cruel "" act ? ""  That's a separate conversation.  But is there such a 'contrast' in the personality and temperament of the God of the ""Old Testament"" and the God of the ""New Testament"" ?  Start pulling out incidents in each ""section"" of the Bible where the contrasting view is present, for a balanced examination of even THAT belief."

I've always disliked a literal fundamentalist reading of the bible and I think that is what scared me away from it.

So I'm going to suggests to my dad that we watch this together as a way of breaching the gap we have between us on this front. I hope he will be able to follow the lecture even in his current state. He is or was a very smart man and even with only half a brain he is by no means stupid 😁 

I don't really know why I'm writing this out and probably no one is going to read it, but if you ever see this Jordan, Thank you for everything you do.

UgyrZBDZuAkHTAN7iBJ4AaABAg,Tom,1516503800693,"JORDAN PETERSON:  IS HE SOWING CHAOS CONCERNING GOD?  
At time point 130:44, Peterson says:  ""I can't tell if I'm an advocate of the religious viewpoint or its worst possible critic, because I am doing my best to make it rational and there's a reductionistic element to that .""  Petersonian ""Christianity"" is a rational, naturalistic religion without any supernatural element.  But Peterson is not hostile towards those who believe in the parts of the Bible that say that supernatural beings and events are literally real.  

In fact, Peterson is friendly towards Christian believers in the supernatural, since Peterson thinks that such believers get from the Christian myth the same psychological benefits that Peterson and his non-supernaturalist followers get from the Christian myth.   

Peterson is like a medical doctor who just wants sick people to take the penicillin that they need to recover, and he doesn't care if the patients take penicillin because they believe penicillin has miraculous powers or because they believe that penicillin works according to the science of medicine, chemistry, bacteriology, and physiology.  

Peterson, in this video (see time point 130:57) says that he is ""leaving the door open to things that I don't understand,"" thereby seemingly suggesting that he (unlike hardcore activist atheists) is open to the idea that the supernatural realm really might literally exist.  

But if you look at his words carefully, I don't think that's what he's really saying.  

He's only saying what any scholar says, which is that there is always more to learn about any subject matter.  Every chemistry professor or physics professor will admit that there are things about their academic discipline that they don't yet grasp.  But there are no reputable professors of physics or chemistry who would say that they leave the door open to the possibility that their sciences may operate according to supernatural dynamics.  What they are open to is further rational, naturalistic information and understanding of chemistry and physics.  

And I think the same is true of Peterson as regards the Bible and religion.  Peterson is a committed naturalist.  Peterson is committed to promoting Christianity as a psychologically and socially beneficial myth.  This is his whole mission in life.

Again, Peterson says at 130:44, ""I can't tell if I'm an advocate of the religious viewpoint or its worst possible critic.""   

Well, he sees the problem himself.   He is indeed the ""worst possible critic"" (or one of the worst, right along with Sam Harris and others), but not of religion in general, but only of the SUPERNATURAL religious viewpoint.  

But unlike the direct assault coming from Sam Harris and others, Peterson's assault is subtle and semi-hidden.  ""Assault"" isn't even the right word for what Peterson is doing.  It's just a replacement, of the supernaturalistic view of religion for the naturalistic (psychological, mythic) view. 

Peterson says, implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) that the universally known facts do not justify acknowledgment of the literal existence of any supernatural realm or beings.  That makes him a skeptic.  He calls himself an ""agnostic"" as regards the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIB05YeMiW8&t=87s   He's using ""agnostic"" to mean ""skeptic,"" I believe, from the context of his statements in that video and in other videos. 

But Peterson says that this skeptical stance does not prevent the Christian myth from operating in a psychologically powerful way in the lives of people.  

Peterson is a professor of psychology.  He believes that psychology can help (""save"") people.  

Peterson looks back on the long history of Western Civilization, and especially the Christian part of that civilization, and he interprets that history as showing that the Christian myth has been an indispensable part of making Western Civilization great.  

And now Peterson is part of the movement to ""Make Western Civilization Great Again.""  

And for Peterson, that means promoting and defending the Christian myth against all of its haters (the Marxists, the Postmodernists, the Atheist Activists, and the Muslims too, though so far I've haven't seen Peterson really focus on the Muslim threat as much as other people trying to save Western Civilization).  

President Trump's 2017 speech about Western Civilization made in Poland is another expression of the movement to save Western Civilization, the same movement of which Jordan Peterson is a conscious member and activist.   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIpmQKEQh40&t=727s

Anyone who has really examined the life of Donald Trump will, I think, conclude that Trump is a skeptic or cynic of all supernatural claims of religion, and views religion in purely pragmatic terms, just like Peterson.  

In fact, I believe that many leaders of the political Conservative Movement are inner skeptics or cynics of all supernatural claims of religion, and see Christianity as a just a pragmatic tool for aiding in the culture war against the ""big government"" ""social democrat"" Progressives.  

Peterson is really just one of these Conservative Movement folks, in my view.  

But I do see Peterson as a very sincere person.  He truly, truly is trying to help people and save Western Civilization through the power of psychology and myth.  

Unlike many politicians, Peterson is not simply a whore for money, power and fame.   

Peterson's new book has the subtitle ""An Antidote to Chaos.""  See:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/

But Peterson himself is a sower of chaos.  

He sows chaos when he says or suggests that faith in supernatural persons and events is not important or necessary in the life of a Christian, and when he says or implies that Christianity is a powerful myth that works just fine in helping people and in saving Western Civilization, even when no one has any faith in supernatural persons and events.  

All these new Petersonian Christians will someday have to face the big question as to whether there really is any supernatural realm at all, any miracles, any life after death, and Peterson will then be of no use to them at all.  They'll end up hating Peterson for leading them out into a desert without a map to the oasis and without a water bottle.   

Peterson uses many words and phrases in an equivocal, ""doublespeak"" sort of way.  

For example, when he talks about the necessity of the recognition of the ""transcendent,"" he's NOT talking about a supernatural realm or being.   He's talking about how our status as biological beings, who were produced by the natural selection process of biological evolution, means that there are ""transcendent"" biological ""structures of reality"" that are completely dominant and unavoidable and which are present in every aspect of our minds, thoughts, language, bodies and societies.  Peterson complaint against Marxism is simply that it is NOT grounded in biology.  Peterson's complaint against Marxism is NOT that it is not grounded in supernatural divine revelation.  

In one video, talking about his campaign against the Canadian law pertaining to transgendered pronouns, listen to what Peterson says:  

""...it's about whether the subjective or the objective is going to take precedence, because implicit in Bill C-16, and I'm telling you there is an assault on the idea of objectivity itself, an assault on the idea of biology itself...""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68NHUV5me7Q

So, in Peterson's mind, Bill C-16 was not against the laws of a supernatural deity or a supernatural Word of God (the Bible), but was against ""the idea of biology itself,"" which he identifies as being identical to the ""the idea of objectivity itself.""  For Peterson, it is biology (i.e., nature) that is ""transcendent,"" the ""structure of reality,"" and the ""Logos.""  

For Peterson to stop sowing this chaos, he would need to stop being semi-evasive and deliberately ambiguous, and instead, in his Bible lectures, always make it crystal clear to his audiences that he that he is a rationalist, naturalist skeptic of all supernatural claims (just like his hero Nietzsche), and that for him the value of the Bible is its use as a pragmatic tool for psychological benefits and proper social ordering (just like his hero Carl Jung). 

The antidote to the chaos of Marxism and Postmodernism is not a counter-chaos.  You don't fight fire with fire, but with water.  You don't fight darkness with darkness, but with light.  You don't fight anti-Reason with an opposing anti-Reason, but with Reason.  You don't fight injustice with an opposing injustice.   You don't fight lies with counter-lies.

(I suppose a cynic and skeptic would say that in the preceding paragraph I am being ridiculously idealistic, and that all life ever can be is the ""struggle for existence"" [Darwin] and the ""war of all against all"" [Hobbes].  I suppose its possible that Peterson is just this sort of cynic and skeptic, deep down, and that Peterson's game is fighting the false utopian myth of Marxism with the opposing false utopian myth of Christianity; but I don't really think Peterson is so crude, crass, cynical, and Machiavellian as that.).

I do see the value and benefits that Peterson's videos bring to many people.  I'm not a Peterson hater, not really.  I just want him to be more precise, clear and open in his speech.  I want him to stop being afraid that he will lose a big part of his audience if he more plainly explains himself and his mission in life.  In Jungian terms, I'm calling on Peterson to stop hiding and to face and integrate his Shadow Self. 

By the way, I haven't tried to document all my claims about Peterson with quotes from Peterson.  That is just too time consuming.  I've watched hundreds of Peterson's videos.  All this information about Peterson from Peterson is out there for anyone to find.

Or that the knowledge was NEEDED regardless of price and that Mimir asking this of him was par for the course.   I have no doubt that he could have amassed this knowledge personally, was it the need that drove him?  Or the foresight that comes with the knowledge?

Thinking back im amazed by that influence on my mind, realy makes you wonder where things like that come from.

Also i remember something from the bible along the line of: the more you suffer in this life, the more you will be rewarded in the next. I always thought what the hell ?? Why even bother creating something just so you can make it suffer???

If you think about it in a psychological manner (as far as i can go, i could aswell be horribly wrong with this) its a reason not to kill yourself during for example a geat crisis where everything falls apart, so to prevent you from just saying somehting along the lines of : well screw this i suffered enough lets go to the next life (by means of suicide).
The bible says suicide is a great sin and you wont go to heaven.

Let me explain: If God is Love, when love replaces God, we have, ""The Fear of Love"", which is an unfortunate meaningless double-concept composed of nonsense amidst nothing, a modern day oxy-moron: a contradiction in terms. 

For if God is Love, then love is everything, and you cannot fear everything, and remain wholly alive. 

Ergo, ""The Fear of God"" is Mr Peterson's fear that his own life is an illusion of judgement. 

The 'fantastic' term ""fear"" can have no relationship to God or The Godhead; and has no basis in rational argument being placed by or near or alongside the referent term 'God', except to the insane living in their own illusions, composed of those when fearing punishment (the martyr), or composed of those when fearing abandonment (the unbelievers).

The full statement, ""The Fear of God is the beginning of Wisdom "" is blasphemy to The Living God in my humble opinion.

God is a Fact, not an ""idea"".

And finally, What is revealed, is, only a reluctance to finally lay down the good doctors sword of judgement and retribution and lean toward love and away from pity and remorse (I'd start here: ""The Sword of Damocles"", link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles)."

Just because you couldn't add 3+2 to save your lives, you twisted f*cks think that no one else could, so your lies are for feel-goodness, or self-profit, of other reasons because human behavior not only doesn't make sense to you, you either don't think others might be able to understand it, or can't imagine that your lies to your children could hurt them because you retarded twisted thinking wrong never resulted in you being homeless, missing a meal, or able to find a mate .. and frankly your too stupid to enjoy figuring anything out. 
.
Or, which is even more Ugly, is you don't want your children to understand how Profoundly Ugly and Horrible today's Western adult female is. Her lying, her manhood, fatherhood, family-structure-Order, Society Hatred, her desire to procreate with any man, and tell the best man it's his, her love of social, sexual, legal, and other Power .. and ability and desire to destroy men's lives because your just vile horrible people as a group that .. 
.. protect the rest of us from your rampant stupidity and/or Satanic twisted souls.
.
My God - Have Mercy!.
The pain you twisted f*cks have cause thinking people, mostly smart men with incredible potential for Goodness for themselves and all of society and the world – what you have done to the world with you twisted retarded lies, ...!!
Driven so many into neurotic horrible lives, suffering, constant Pain, death-of-Joy-Love, suicide, a living Hell.

UgxmgraK_Tc5Hd64HSZ4AaABAg,Tom,1516503818435,"WHERE KARL MARX & JORDAN PETERSON AGREE ON RELIGION
It occurred to me today that both Karl Marx and Jordan Peterson agree that the role of religion is to defend and maintain the societal Dominance Hierarchy.  Where Marx and Peterson disagree is on whether it is good and necessary to maintain the societal Dominance Hierarchy.  Marx says no, Peterson says yes.  For Marx, religion is the ""opiate of the masses.""  For Peterson, religion is the proper ordering of the masses.  

Both Marx and Peterson view religion in a functional, pragmatic sense.   

In Petersonism, the traditional religions are true, or contain truth, because they ""work,"" i.e., they function well in maintaining the societal Dominance Hierarchy, in fending off attempts by Marxists to overthrow the societal Dominance Hierarchy, and in preventing many people from ever becoming Marxists."

""Conscious of what it is to be human"" but not knowing what it means. I also have considered how the mindfulness of our actions and perceptions are manipulated by thoughts and dreams. What motivates us  to choose different values? Figurative language helps us articulate the thoughts and emotions and motivation is related to our desires (nature, in born tendency). Patterns are both nature and nurture. Every thing is truth but perceptions color and organize the memory into a meaningful pattern. Like when we live a purpose driven life...for me if you don't stand for something you will fall for anything. When truthful/sincere love is a foundation or your myth it is the key to happiness, joy and peace."

(Matt 13:11),
""Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.""

Mr Peterson will have to kneel in his temple [body] and truly surrender himself to the will of God by letting Him come into his house [body] and steer him to Christ. This cannot happen until a person can come to terms with the fact that human freewill is merely an illusion, a phantom of the carnal mind.  When you surrender your foolish notion of freewill to God because He alone is sovereign and has all foreknowledge then the lake of His fire begins to burn you out into a new creation. 

(Phil 2:13),
""...it is God [not man] which works in you BOTH TO WILL [God causes us ""to will'] and TO DO [God causes us ""to do'] of His good pleasure"" to bring about His intentions.""

The beauty of this lecture is that it exposes the very deep nature of thought when dealing with individual subjective experience that we can relate with. Our desire to plant flags religiously is what has closed the door to a personal relationship with God in so that we are blinded by our fear of thinking constructively about who God is.

The satan that is loosed is the merchant corporation called Israel, spiritual Egypt.

The dragon or spiritual Egypt was bound a plural of thousands. What bound that dragon? Why the Roman state and its armies and it was kept in check until the end of the third reich, the last of the Roman Imperial power, now this isn't some pro NAZI statement but just opening up what the little season of satan means. It is the modern merchant state of Israel and they go out to deceive the nations, the ethnos or gentiles, those that are not ""Jewish"" .They pursue the Christians just as the Pharaoh pursued Israel out of literal Egypt so shall the unbelieving Jews pursue spiritual Israel out of spiritual Egypt, but they were stopped by the Roman legions and the wings of a great eagle were give to the woman (the believing) until the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD. But now it is loosed again. So sit back relax and watch the show because you ain't going to stop what God has loosed.

There is no SHALL LIE in verse 8

Revelation 11
8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

Revelation 12
13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. 
14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

Saul of Tarsus was part of the dragon until his conversion. The time, times and half a time is until the destruction of Jerusalem. The dragon was cast to the earth, it no longer possessed the kingdom. 

Daniel 7
21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
22 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

There is no SHALL in verse 28.

Matthew 19
28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

John 12
31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

1 Peter 4
17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

There is no SHALL in verse 2.

1 Corinthians 6
2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

""Lived and reigned with Christ for the plural of thousands""? And Judgement was given them? 

Revelation 20
1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

Remember Jerusalem or its system of rule is being likened to Egypt “spiritual Egypt”

Ezekiel 29
3 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. 

Revelation 20
7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

The word that has been translated to thousand not ONE thousand is χίλιοι it does not say one thousand that would be χίλια, it is a plural of thousands.

G5507
χίλιοι
chilioi
khil'-ee-oy
Plural of uncertain affinity; a thousand: - thousand. 

Our King and judge and high priest is Christ, He will judge all men. When the woman was caught in adultery Jesus uses a word that specifically means satan, It has been translated to accusers.

John 8
10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

From G2596 and G58; against one in the assembly, that is, a complainant at law; specifically Satan: - accuser.

So the satan that fell are the accusers, the high priest and his Sanhedrin. Roman Catholicism that inherited its high priest titles from Pergamos ""I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is:"" from the priesthood that escaped Babylon during the reign of Cyrus the Great, so they become another seat of accusation, probably the beast with the horns of a lamb but speaks like a dragon. The reformers payed with their lives to bring about many of the freedoms we now seek to destroy."

Christ the Wisdom and Power of God
18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written: 

         “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; 
         the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”

20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength. 
26 Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”

He says things like ""whenever you get something you wanted, you aren't satisfied, because then the game starts all over again"".. Certainly that can be true at times, but there are also unquestionably times when satisfaction is attained after getting something you wanted.. Nearly dying of thirst, really WANT to survive, and find a spring of pure water? Satisfaction, perhaps TEMPORARY, but pretty much nobody would question that if nothing else, the moment of drinking the water is satisfactory, if not the cessation of dehydration and the negative effects that come with it. And if there truly WASN'T any satisfaction to be gained from pursuits in the world - lasting or fleeting - then what could a ""noble aim"" possibly look like? What could possibly be considered ""noble"" in a universe where satisfaction is non-existent? What's the point in helping feed or house the poor if you believe they aren't going to receive satisfaction? And to get back to his question as to what is to stop a person from being a pure hedonist, well, if he believes we live in a world without satisfaction then A. no amount of hedonism - moral or immoral - could possibly ever satisfy an individual but also B. There really WOULD be no moral argument to not ""just do whatever you want"" regardless of the ""moral"" implications; What are you taking from someone in a universe where they are incapable of feeling satisfaction when you kill them? Their life, yes, but if you believe they were incapable of feeling or producing satisfaction, then what is the purpose of their life? Of anyone's life? Of anything? In short, the idea that satisfaction doesn't exist is an illogical one that leads only to nihilism."

God is to the scientist a primal force, to the philosopher a hypothesis of unity, to the religionist a living spiritual experience. Man’s inadequate concept of the personality of the Universal Father can be improved only by man’s spiritual progress in the universe and will become truly adequate only when the pilgrims of time and space finally attain the divine embrace of the living God on Paradise.1:6.8 (30.7) God is spirit — spirit personality; man is also a spirit — potential spirit personality. Jesus of Nazareth attained the full realization of this potential of spirit personality in human experience; therefore his life of achieving the Father’s will becomes man’s most real and ideal revelation of the personality of God. Even though the personality of the Universal Father can be grasped only in actual religious experience, in Jesus’ earth life we are inspired by the perfect demonstration of such a realization and revelation of the personality of God in a truly human experience."

UgyOu8UkEfOZN-g8lSB4AaABAg,pierdolsiegoogle,1511233464539,"Dir Sir, I frankly believe those ""subpersonalities"" you're talking about are exactly the memeplexes. The process of your ""god's mergers"" should then obey the laws of Darwin, or maybe Lamarck to be strict as they inherit the changes during the lifespan of single replication cycle, so to speak -- to ascertain the dominance in memory space obtained. Many interesting computer simulations showed that there are many ways to show a meta-stable ""ways of doing things"", until some accident (we pull it off on purpose since the dawn of empirical sciences such as masonry or agriculture -- thus the rapid rate of changes in current era) shifts the whole society towards another stable pattern.  Currently, the rate of ""knowledge"" must rise up for sole purpose of maintaining the overwhelmingly overgrown population, as the basic instinct, or rather very nature of life is self-repetition against all reality. You see, lots of people can do better than a brilliat few as shown in Wikipedia project and what every big-data scientist will tell you about traffic-jam detecting apps. XXIcentury will have to not only withstand the horrible shift between the stable states, but rather develop a way to survive the massive, still underestimated power of the Internet to speed up the rate of change of ways people think and do in life. This gigantic shift is not taken seriously while the fake info war changes voting outcomes or can influence the international business affairs. Even the monarchies or mighty USA fear the power of hackers...

Any less is unacceptable.   As it stands, the old testament and koran have a god with the psychological profile of a psychopath especially islam.   We've had psychopaths running things far too long, it's time for the empaths to take control.   Jesus was the only empath of the abrahamic religions and most don't understand what he spoke of.

I ordered my horse to be brought form the stables. The servant did not understand my orders. So I went to the stables myself, saddled my horse, and mounted. In the distance I heard the sound of a trumpet, and I asked the servant what it meant. He knew nothing and had heard nothing. At the gate he stopped and asked: “Where is the master going?”

“I don’t know,” I said, “just out of here, just out of here. Out of here, nothing else, it’s the only way I can reach my goal.”

“So you know your goal?” he asked.

“Yes,” I replied, “I’ve just told you. Out of here- that’s my goal.”

“You have no food with”, he said.

Ugz273zEAn2steGFH254AaABAg,Mac Tek,1511233489252,"Jesus said it is about Love. Paul said it is about Love. Love is the creative force of the universe. It is man's capacity for Love, not romantic thoughts of love/lust, but for agape Love that redeems us. If we did not know Love, we could never know Christ and then we would be lost.

""If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."""

Every time I try to watch a video by JP, he says something puzzling to say the least. ""There are people that claim that dreams are the result of random neural firing, which is a theory I find absurd"". Perhaps because they use the word ""random"", which is understandable. Random simply means that if one were to plot the firings over time one would get a ""random"" distribution just like we would if we plotted ""random"" mutations over time. Bottom line, it is not an absurd theory. Random or not, all of our thoughts and experiences are a result of  neural firings."

I find it fascinating even people like Peterson talk about Christianity from the perspective of Nitzche and Jung and Freud but never the Hebrews when they are the ones that wrote the Bible. Peterson does not dignify the author, he does not dignify Jewish Unity Principle and he does not dignify the hidden Hebrew metaphors that are the real essence and intention of the Bible.  The Old Testament is a weapon, a sword that revolveth, to protect the way of the tree of life that is populated with beasts of the field, cattle, fowl, things that creepeth all metaphorical allusions to varied classifications of man.  Slave Masters and the Slave,  Jew and Gentile, meted out in the two separate creations of man. How does Peterson miss this?  He does not read or study Hebrew literature."

Each Sunday, we'll watch a Jordan Peterson lecture and then have a discussion about it.
I'll call the churches:  The Temples of Meaning.  The religion will be called Jordanism.
We, the constituents of this new church, will be called Jordanians.

Eventually, we'll have to conquer the country of Jordan, not only due to their errant and annoying claims to be the ""real Jordanians,"" but also to finally get those buckos in the Middle East think properly, clean their rooms, and sort their shit out.  

Now, those are lofty aims:  Start a religion and bring peace to the most deeply entrenched conflict on the planet.  I feel better already (Just like Jordan said I would!).

I also suggest looking at the lack of law or guidance on internet behavior our now universal language being the new Babel and the group extremes.  I would also suggest not commenting on only humans recognizing consciences because of narcissistic limitations of humans being the end all of awareness to not even acknowledge that there are “Aliens” with absolute proof still denied. If you really watch dogs they do not like food thrown at them or onto the floor, our assumptions are interpretations.  Humans have changed the Bible for negative controlling purposes do you foresee them changing the wording to accept the current and continuing change of society so the stories continue.  Perhaps why God is dead recognizing the controlling through lies instead of truth and now truth is manifesting.  If you look at Lot he was told to go to the nearest town yet he went to the mountains and a new story that his daughters got him drunk to have sex with both of them and the mother mysteriously turned to salt yet today we are against pedophilia at least in this country perhaps not looking at the keepers of the books aka church and perhaps that is why the story has not been adjusted."

Much like a story in the New Testament where a demon possessed slave girl was advertising Apostle Paul's ministry and telling people to follow him.

Actually, this lecture is interesting and he knows his stuff, but it boils down to this: the Bible as literature. Chuck out the -isms (he still wants to insist on being a Christian, but Christianity was never understood like this in all the official doctrines). Joseph Campbell also did this better and there are many stories whose esthetic value is precisely the lurid, hideous, toxic and violence they describe. The Bible may be too contaminated a book by our culture to actually make Pederson´s readings feasible (much like the actual philosophy of Heidegger and his Nazi involvement).

While Pederson speaks of the great esthetic beauty of the Bible, he forgets the other stuff that is so far from wisdom and truth as to be more the ravings of a lunatic (not that these can have no literary value). We should also ask how much literary value can be attributed to the great English translations as opposed to the originals (Harold Bloom finds the New Testament blandly lacking next to the delirious splendor of much of the Old Testament, not to mention, totally ""un-Jewish"" in what it proposes).."

UgxlZaADrSRwI7FguWR4AaABAg,Rogerrramjet1,1505963151225,"Some scholars argue that even without Prophets or guides, we should be able to gain some knowledge of God by observing the universe and then act accordingly. There is some evidence to support this argument. Before Islam, many people, including Muhammed, were born and lived in Makkah. The heartland of Arab paganism and idolatry. Noone showed them the way to God or spoke to them of the oneness of God. And yet history records a simple nomad's remark: "" Camel droppings point to a camel existence. Footprints on the sand tell of a traveler. Heaven with its stars, the Earth with its mountains and valleys, and the sea with waves don't they point to the All- Powerful, All Knowing, Wise,and Caring Maker? ""

Even a simple Beduin could understand this much, what about the others? What about Muhammed, who one day would be appointed to deliver God final revelation began, he understood the world's reality, perceived the Truth and began search for it. Taking refuge in the Hira Cave, he devoted himself to worship, only occasionally coming home for provisions. This might indicate that we can reach some degree of Knowledge and so worship God.

That message came in a cave about 3 miles out of Mecca called Hira, to which the Prophet would often retire, sustaining himself with only kaak, which was flour cooked in oil. One night in the month of Ramadan in 611, the Angel Gabriel appeared to him in a dream, held out long silk strip with written letters and said: "" Read "" (The word in Arabic is iqra from which Quran is derived.

The Prophet replied that he did not know how to read. Gabriel grasped the Prophet so tightly to his breast that he thought he would die. Thrice Gabriel commanded: "" Read! Finally Muhammed(SAV) answered, "" What am I to read?"" Then were revealed the first versus of Quran, Surah 96, 1-5: "" Proclaim!(Read!) In the name of thy Lord and Cherisher who created man out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful. He who taught(the use of ) the pen taught man that which he knew not.

The only way I know what my dreams mean is that I understand myself. Spent a lot of time isolated from society and other ppl with nothing to do but think and analyze what was going on in my head each day. If I were trying to teach someone else to do this, I would instruct honesty. Brutal honesty with one's self. Every urge. Every hate. Every insecurity. You have to spend 1000's of hours thinking about why they present in you the way they do. For me my urges are for specific drugs, I'm a ""recovered"" addict, but I only was able to stop by rigorous self reflection and honesty. My life will never be normal again. It never was normal, but it will never seem normal to ppl without this behavioral malady. I have constructed safe guards and systems in my life that slow me in certain areas so that I am forced to think about what I'm doing and be very purposeful if I wish to continue. For instance with money. Money is very dangerous to me. It can be very much like handing a loaded gun to a suicidal person for me to allow myself to have instant access to 1000's of dollars. 

When the person you fear the most lives in your head you don't have any other option than to know that person and know them really well. You make a mistake and you buy an expensive thing you can't afford. You take it back or you cut back on other things until you've paid it off. If I make a mistake I lose everything in the course of a few hours. My place to live. My job. My friends and family lose all trust in me. Trust that took years to build. My life falls apart and I often end up living in a cage for months or years at a time. It's very very stressful to manage things in your mind that were never meant to be managed.

UgwMk8Rxadb9fynaKYx4AaABAg,W Mint,1503284758802,"The believer's concept of god gets sculpted throughout life, like clay applied to a wireframe(which is the Yahweh character taught to them initially), by misattributing various natural phenomena and experiences to it. For example: Good experiences(""God blesses you""), positive mental states(""God is love""), good behavior(""God's morality""), one's existence(""God created us""), Earth(""God's earth""), and the universe in general. If completely successful, the individual becomes one god character away from nihilism. As seen so commonly from fundamentalists, and the crumpled mess of their worldview that they love to project to non-believers.

The deeply theistic worldview can be seen as an upside down pyramid, teetering on its point. With the god claim being the bottom most point, almost entirely depended upon. It has little flexibility for change, and the central point(Yahweh's existence), is very uncomfortable to question. Effort need to continuously go into re-balancing the structure, from church once a week to praying multiples times a day. I would argue that a more healthy scientific worldview could be seen as tree's root system branching downwards. Where the individual's understanding of the world does not all come down to a focal point(one claim being true). But rather a wide variety of sources. Which leaves each source for an explanation much more comfortable to self-correct and change with consideration for new information. And weight can be shifted to other sources when a root is found incapable.

There's a dependency on concepts like ""god's will"" and ""sin"" for understanding morality and ethics. So deeper consideration on why things are actually right or wrong are not understood enough to apply in more complex, real situations. This includes contrived answers like ""God did it"", as they broadly stifle further inquiry for the comfort of a perceived absolute answer. It ignores how accuracy is actually developed, and will easily devalue the scientific method in the mind of the believer.

That comes to the issue of co-opting the ultimate authority of god, for example, through the concept of blessing. Cognitive dissonance that would otherwise arise, is avoided by merging one's will with god's will. When one feels blessed by god(that god's will is behind your actions and experiences), then introspection into those actions is more easily avoidable. Imagine for example a child hits another, and the other asks why they did so. They respond ""Dad said I could punch you."" This avoids further consideration into the action, whether it is right or wrong and why. Without the authority of Dad, the child would need further reasoning to justify their action to themselves and others. Reusing God's authority with terms like ""sin"" and attributing things to God's will snowballs throughout life, lessening the need for the individual to think about the details of why something is right or wrong. This is a common long term consequence of the Abrahamic faiths that does not require the individual to be a narcissist because the authority is externalized via the god character."
Ugz-rVlDix5h44YAqn54AaABAg,ROMAÆTERNA,1503284758807,"Jordan Peterson is correct about emphasizing the LATE Roman Empire versus Christianity regarding being subject to something “higher”; however, it is Ancient Romans that lived under their concepts of Divine Justice and Rule of Law.

This highly praised, deeply influential individual looked at the first verse of the Gospel According to John.

""In the beginning,"" he read, ""was the Word.""  No, he said, that's not right.  Well, what, from what I do know, is the correct frame or conceptual context?  Perhaps it's In the beginning,  was the Meaning. . .  Better, he said, but not quite right.  Perhaps it's in the beginning, was the Power?  Again, we're getting closer, but . . .  In the beginning, was the Act.  Ah, that's it!

As the Scriptures say, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.” So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it’s all nonsense. But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God’s weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength. Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world’s eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you. Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important. As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.

UgwXHbraFG-XPoTIrOt4AaABAg,Grandma Mo Says,1503284772684,"I used to remember all my dreams. I have a sleep disorder that was untreated most of my life (I would have trouble falling asleep and would wake every time I hit REM sleep) and most of the time my dreams were nightmares. When I was a child I'd be running from danger, or falling and in one case I woke screaming that there were bugs and snakes in my bed. That last dream stayed with me even when I was awake, so real that I fell from the ladder to my upper bunk because I still saw those bugs and snakes - even though I was awake and the light was on. I had depression when I was about ten years old and I dreamed of a tunnel with a light at the end of it, and I knew I had a choice to go to that light or to stay. I had never heard about near death experiences or ""going to the light"" and hadn't yet  been exposed to religion. I suspect this type of dream led to the formulation of the various myths associated with these experiences.

      As an adult my dreams were nightmares wherein I'd be trying to hide from someone hunting me, or I was trying in get to someone I cared about through a weird disjointed landscape with rivers I couldn't cross and through buildings of many rooms that looked like they were built by some mad architect. All my dreams were dark.  

    A doctor decided the sleep specialist was wrong about my sleep disorder and decided to take me off the medications the specialist put me on. By day twenty-three I was seeing people who weren't really there, and the only reason I knew it was a waking dream was because I saw a little girl at the table when I was in an adults' hospital ward.

    Needless to say, dreams hold a fascination for me.  Mine made a kind of sense because they reflected the people and things I was afraid of.  I can absolutely see how religions and myths could be born out of our dreams and fears. We try to make sense of a world that we don't understand. We reach out for any explanation, so when we can't find it on our own we turn to explanations passed on to us from people who claim to know more than we do. We reach out for the tales of our ancestors and it doesn't matter if these tales make sense or not."

But she asked me to still read the Bible from time to time. When I asked my father ""Why?"" (almost hoping he said I didn't have to, cause he's an agnostic), he said ""Because it's amazing. It's a dark comedy. You'll love it"". I ended up reading the whole damn thing, little by little in the span of 3 years. So it's funny that Dr. Peterson wrote ""It's a comedy"" as number one on the list in describing the Bible. I'm no way religious, but I do appreciate the Bible as a crazy amazing creation in the history of humanity, that is beautiful as an artistic creation but also mind blowingly valuable as a tool for teachings of moral values in societies. It's always fascinates me how the ancient cultures could produce so much meaningful works (monuments, literatures, teachings, etc) with deep understanding in human psyche and science. Almost embarrassing to see how most people think or behave today. I so appreciate the works of Dr. Peterson. There is hope for the millennials after all.."

Ugg8yN1ZD5vNxngCoAEC,brrrayday,1503284780498,"@Jordan B Peterson   The Logos is how God interacts with our space-time.  God spoke, causing a force or vibration to come into existence, this 'speech' is the Logos and is characterized by what it does to this reality (and you are right that it is also consciousness because only that can manifest change through time).  Once this is understood, one can also see that when it is said of Jesus that everything was made through Him and for Him, it makes sense because the Logos is God's initial cause (at least for us), the Creator; while simultaneously acknowledging that the Logos is God because the Logos is a direct manifestation of God.

This can be applied to a personal level, as a person's action on the world is a part of them.  For instance, if I decide to build a shed, and do it, I have altered my world.  You, however, are not affected because you are separate from my actions.  The Logos's value as speech comes through because I can then tell you I built a shed, communicate and maybe even show you a picture, all making my actions real to you (or as real as any memory).

If by chance you see this, I would like to applaud what you are doing with your lecture series here.  I have long found it to be the case that the Bible has something important to say on every level I've approached it from.  In terms of what you're doing, certainly not a fascinating psychoanalytic approach!  But at least from trying to understand it literally and figuratively, as well as studying prophecy (prophecy is pattern!).  The Akedah, or when Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac, was a prophesy enacted in real life to be written down and truly understood later.  His offering happened most likely on the very same spot as Jesus's crucifixion.  Missler just recently posted a video about the Akedah, and in it he made a very strong case that Abraham had a confidence that God would raise his son from the dead, so perhaps that will add some context?  I don't find that offering to be capricious in any way.  If I had a direct line to God like that and He told me to do something, I'd do it; but consider He had also told Abraham that Isaac would have children.  Abraham had faith, a true faith, that was based on something he knew to be true.  Because of his faith, this wild event was remembered and recorded, and end up becoming fulfilled prophecy in Jesus Christ, except it is God offering His Son (which means what he produced for into this space-time, the Logos) for mankind.  These hyperlinks are more than just cross references, they are profound reinforcements of fundamental Christian beliefs, and it is absolutely remarkable to study.  I fully intend on spending my life doing just that!

A strange, quantifiable verification of the Biblical story happens in the New Testament as well.  If you study the Greek underlying Jesus's genealogy in the New Testament, you will find something Missler calls ""heptadic structures.""  Basically, the number of nouns, verbs, male names, female names, words not verbs, consonants, vowels, on and on, are all perfectly divisible by seven.  Considering there are three genealogies of Christ in the New Testament (Mark, Luke, John), by three different authors, and they all share this same trait despite their varying natures, this means that the only certain way for this to have happened is if all those ancestors, and in John's case the Creation narrative, happened exactly as they are laid out-- in the real world-- to be recorded and understood later.

Chew on it, Doc.  I'd be curious if you had a take on it.  A quick breakdown of heptadic structures can be found on YouTube by searching those terms and looking for Chuck Missler.  He's very analytical and thorough with the Bible and understanding of the underlying languages.

He talks about nietzche announcing the death of God and that society would need to replace morality with the superman idea, which sounds like humanism. Peterson, like Jung disagrees with this idea. But later on in his talk Peterson talks about Moses giving the ten commandments to Israel after having a revelation of what it takes to make peace between people. He makes it sound like God didn't actually give the law to Moses and that Moses might have been a humanist himself. I'm trying to figure out if Peterson believes in a super natural god, which is how the bible had been historically interpreted, and if there is absolute truth that determines morality. He makes Moses sound like he believed in relative morality which somehow he personified as God. This seems like a silly thing to say. There are countless stories of God interacting with Moses as a being, not just as a collection of good ideas. Anyone else notice this?"

UgirvPYtwZlqdHgCoAEC,TheHelleri,1503284788313,"1:52:54 Sacrifice for the future gain is not a uniquely human trait. Squirrels, woodpeckers, foxes (just to name a few animals) all do this. They expend a great deal of energy to store away food for later use. Most of the time they are unable to find the food they stashed. But they do it anyway. You could say it's different because it's just instinct. What their genes tell them to do. But if you've seen enough of this, you'll have noted that offspring old enough travel with the parent watch the parent do this. They also try to mimic what they see the parent do. And often times the adults won't store food, but instead retreat with it if they see that they have been detected. But not just by you. By others of their kind that are not necessarily part of their group. 

So they do teach it to others of their kind to some degree. They do have a mind towards it being something for their personal use. And they do it a lot (spreading the odds). The great thing about food storing among some animals is that even their failures benefit them in the long term. Because lost food either fertilizes soil or reseeds the ground. Some small animals are better at securing their future than most humans."

I'm curious what Peterson's thoughts are on the field of Apologetics? He's made some interesting points in regards to stories being proven to have been preserved in more/less their original form throughout the ages, but people make this very argument when questioning the validity of the Bible; that it's completely made-up, and/or has been changed from its original text.

To see this guy with almost a half million views is sort of like watching a sequoia tree start as a seed and bloom into significant existence. Momma's baby boy all grows up now. I'm assuming most of these viewers are somewhat new to JBP.  A lot of ideas in this particular lecture are a compilation of his numerous youtube lectures on mythology and psychology.  JBP is a rare entity in the fact that he's not only a psychologist but he's also a well rounded philosopher, historian, debater, and can articulate these subjects for a  layman such as myself.  If this lecture is too abstract I'd recommend starting out with Reality and the Sacred and slowly delve into his Toronto lectures. The ideas in this man's head have literally blown my mind and have taught me about consciousness,  how the human mind works and why we think the way we do. Fellow humans!

You were discussing how people with lower IQ are having a hard time finding jobs that are suited for them. Even the lower ""white collar class"". This is something that has always troubled me because I myself am considered part of the lower ""blue collar working class"" and it wasn't always by choice. I never had a chance to go off to school because I had to help my parents raise my brother who is mentally disabled, he's autistic. I don't consider myself ""stupid"" but it's sad to see that even the basic jobs that can be done, often require an associates degree at the least. This is something I worry about because as the times change, I often worry about job loss, and how will I provide for myself and my brother, as I know he will ultimately become my responsibility one day.

As a side note to people who think that this disproves legitimate religious experiences, false stimulus doesn't, in any way disprove the legitimate. Does a detailed picture of a tiger (a false stimulus) prove that real tigers don't exist? Of course not, that would be silly. 
2) World theology and archeology are hobbies of mine (but I don't know every civilization in detail). As far as I know, except for a few little communes and twentieth century communism, all morality has been based on religion. Is it even possible to separate them? Modern social justice seems to be the result of the attempt.
3) I have always treated my future self as a somewhat different person, and I'll leave notes and hints for myself when working on long term projects, so if I stop for a year and come back to it, I can figure out what I was thinking and pick it up again with minimal disruption."

Yes, science could not exist without our monotheistic thought, but that monotheism can turn into centuries of oppression or a philosophical revolution, but lets remember Christian got the worst of this while Islam somehow transcended. Secondly I would argue that monotheism would not exist, and obviously did not without first having polytheism. The idea of one God, one truth, came from many gods and many truths. 

Math only represents reality, it cannot replace it, nor can it exist without reality, therefore it cannot be more true. Which seems to be a good way to understand why religion isn't true either. It is a psychological abstraction of human consciousness that tries to explain what we are feeling. In short, yes it is obvious that the abstraction is less real than reality.

The attributes of Marduk absorbed from the conglomeration of various pathos is of course exactly what Christianity is in a nutshell, just a new version. 

""Fear of God is the foundation of wisdom."" Absolutely, for a lot of humanity this is as high as it goes, because higher thinking is beyond them. That is why religion is still a useful tool, because too many people would be too bad if they did not fear going to hell at the end of it of their life. 

The Bible was in fact edited and revised by committee, they were called the The council of Nicaea. (You seem to say this early and later go ahead an acknowledge it)

If we are a speck on a speck on the shit-side of the galaxy does not mean it is not true and should create something to believe otherwise just to comfort our ego. (That is the heart of religion, you seem to justify it based off a crazy argument)

The Bible is not a comedy. ""Happy Ending"" is not the definition of comedy a comedy makes you laugh, hopefully often. The bible does not have a sense of humor. 

The bible is not ""hyper linked"", and it's ability to reference other parts of the Bible was did not originate with the Bible. The Egyptian Book of the Dead Scrolls  and the Greek Odyssey both had no problems making references to other parts of it's literature, how hilarious you make this claim.  

Of course the ""evidence for genuine religious experience is incontrovertible"" that doesn't mean religion is incontrovertible. 

Abstract out the ideal. Why not just stick with Plato's Forms?  

""Handle of the image of God as an abstraction"" Ok, I can do that, but like math it is not more real than what is real."

But the knights who listen not to the shapeshifters but instead heed the words of the wise master,
They pass beneath the gates,
They who can first master and pass by the mindless monster of the deeps, 
They who can pass the final  trap, the  Hall of Many Mirrors that ensnared the shapeshifters, 
They enter into the jewelled cavern, the  glittering cave,

UgjJcqBsQt5vxXgCoAEC,shotinthedark90,1503284805954,"I think there's an important difference between God as abstract principle and God as the actual ground of existence. For example, when Moses comes off of Sinai with the ten commandments, his enlightenment (concerning a properly functioning society in which God ""dwells among"" the people as the hub of their interpersonal relations) is not merely the invention of an abstract theory which is supposed to harmonize the data of his interpersonal experience. He is not fabricating a deity in the thin air of his imagination. Rather, he is DISCOVERING what the ground of being has always been like and how it has always been trying to push out to the surface of human relationships and experience. That's what the ""manifest presence"" of God means -- it's that latent but perpetually active ""logos"" which has always been there attempting to shine out through every level of human existence. That's also why Israel is prophetically pictured as a virgin in labor pains, a people carrying the presence of God in a veiled and incomplete way. So God is not an abstract ideal projected by man's intellect into one of his operating theoretical paradigms as its cohesive principle. That's ideology, of which Dr. Peterson is himself skeptical. Instead, God is a real and active essence who is REVEALED rather than INVENTED. To be sure, Moses' experience as a social mediator would, to some extent, inform how he engaged with and sought that real essence. But it is not mere abstraction. Although, I guess you could argue that the process of abstraction just IS that very opening of mind and soul to the real and operative, though hidden, ground of being. Then you'd have an interesting hypothesis."

Religion stole the bible from man, and in doing so (as planned), they destroyed mans understanding of natural law, the real definition of god and mans freedom from evil and the lie of original sin.  Understanding the bible is simple, read every word and it's definition from a concordance or a translation text.  It's as simple as that.  No one in religion or religious studies is doing this, and their dogmas and doctrines are all wrong and weaponized on purpose to lead you away from the bible.

I would pull out of them only the historically interesting things. However, having been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after military service, my life had ground to a halt. Every thing bad that happened to me was so powerful mentally that I began to avoid life altogether whenever I had the chance. A well crafted facade was what kept me as a functioning member of society.

Since I have discovered your lectures on the bible however, my mind has seemingly been rewired. Especially when I listened to your interview with Joe Rogan. The things you say are so profound, and furthermore they make logical sense.

UghuPLgz0FzuuXgCoAEC,Mimimom123,1503284807980,"The times we are living in, dual world power of Great Britain and US.our ""melting pot"" foretold in Daniel 2:1-49 “And just as you saw the feet and the toes to be partly of clay of a potter and partly of iron, the kingdom will be divided, but some of the hardness of iron will be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with soft clay. 42 And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 43 Just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay,* they will be mixed with the people; but they will not stick together, one to the other, just as iron does not mix with clay.**
44 “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever, 45 just as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The Grand God has made known to the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
   The clay is referred to as “the offspring of mankind,” or the common people. (Dan. 2:43) In the Anglo-American World Power, people have risen up to claim their rights through civil rights campaigns, labor unions, and independence movements. The common people undermine the ability of the Anglo-American World Power to act with ironlike strength. Also, opposing ideologies and close election results that do not end up in a clear majority have weakened the power base of even popular leaders, so that they have no clear mandate to implement their policies.
Why will God’s Kingdom have to “crush” earthly rulerships? Because these insist on perpetuating the God-defying spirit of self-determination promoted by Satan back in the garden of Eden. In addition to working against mankind’s best interests, those who strive to perpetuate that spirit put themselves on a collision course with the Creator. (Psalm 2:6-12; Revelation 16:14, 16) Hence, we must ask ourselves, ‘Are we for or against rule by God?’

Ugjnr2G7vtZlpngCoAEC,Haxxus,1503284809611,"Why do I always end up so lost? It's like one day I have it all figured out, and then the next I do something so incredibly stupid and suddenly I realize that everything that I thought was good, isn't. I'm sick of the facades. I'm sick of putting up my own facades. I just wish I knew how to be exactly who I am. Not who I want to be, but who I am. I feel like a pushover, I feel so passive. But I question if the only reason I feel that way is because I'm comparing myself to other people. I wish I could just stop doing that. I wish I could be secure in who I was. I wish I didn't need to pump my head up full of grandeur just to counterbalance my dissatisfaction with myself and my life. I don't feel like I'm actually all that smart. And the truth is...I'm probably not. Having interests in things other people don't have doesn't mean Shit when you continue to put yourself on the same level as them.  I'm insecure because I'm broke, because my house is a mess, I'm fat, my girlfriend is amazing but she doesn't fit these vain preconceived notion that I have... I don't click with anyone the way I want too. I don't have any real friends, partially because I'm judgemental, yet understanding all at the same time. I see thing I don't like and in order to not be cast out, I don't speak on them. I don't speak my mind, I don't say what I mean. I'm afraid to come off like an arrogant asshole. I'm afRaid to acknowledge that maybe I am an arrogant asshole. I want to be liked. I don't want to be the type of person that wants to be liked but...I just do. I want people to look at me and see me as something, so that way maybe I'll see myself as something. I just don't have anything. All these brains, all this wisdom and I have nothing to show for it. Why do I need things? Why is it that the things that make me up are so material??

I just want to escape. I want to run away to a place where life isn't what it is here. I want to wake up everyday, pick fruit from the trees, sit amongst a circle of people I truly like... and laugh, get high, share food. Tell jokes and stories. Hell who knows have orgies haha. But my life is SOO incredibly far from that. It's like my soul got out in the wrong place. The type of person my background and life calls for is simply not the person I am...I just want to finally be happy, to be free from all the burdens. I want all the treasures of facing the dragon, without actually facing that dragon...and...that makes me a coward. Perhaps I'd even face the dragon if I knew it wouldn't crush me and the people I love. Part of me knows what I have to do. I have to uncover stones I've been covering for years. I did something terrible. I took advantage of my little sister, someone whom I was supposed to protect. It makes me sick to think I did that so long ago. The mistakes I've made as a young teenager have gone on to define who I am long into adulthood. It makes me afraid to think that one day it could all come flooding back to her and the world will finally see me for what I am. A sick individual who is trying to create the image that he is better than he actually is. And in that pursuit I only end up dragging myself down more. When I was really young, maybe 4 or 5, another kid did to me what someone was probably doing to him. And it continued for years. I don't know how it's affected me. I don't feel anything when I think about it...and I don't know what that means. I love and I hate my own mother. That makes me feel sad beyond belief. I feel as though she has put everybody in her life above me besides her other kids. And I wonder if they feel that too. I feel like the monster within my own basement. I feel as though my only hope is to continue pushing forward because if I stop for one second, the ground beneath me will collapse. My father was never apart of my life the way he should have been, and the sad part is, I'm still longing for that acceptance. I'm still longing to be one of the guys. 

Now I'm a broke college student. I'm poor, but I have far more now than I did as a kid...which ultimately still isn't much. I'm unsure if pursuing my degree in Clinical Psychology is the right choice. I don't know if I'm doing it because I actually want the degree, or I am doing it because I want to finally get the look of approval from those around. For my own country to even look at me and accept me. The alternative is work my ass off at mediocre jobs just to have an apartment and a car, just to feel for a year or two that I'm actually making progress. I just want to feel like I'm finally getting ahead. I want to feel as if I'm facing the dragon, and actually putting a dent in it. I feel better after articulating this. Hopefully someone else can offer me some insight. Or just confirm the things I already feel to be true about myself...."

Now I know from the comments that follows his videos, a lot of people tend to either look down on Islam as something 'backward' or equate it with ISIS (we hate ISIS btw, they damage our religion and culture as much, if not more than colonization ever did). But I see Islam as an extension of Christianity (which was an extension of Judaism), repackaged (in lack for better words) to unify and give what was then a group of warring tribes in the Middle East, a greater sense of purpose enough to stop fighting with one another and  build their own civilization. A lot of people forget that a lot of basic scientific and mathematical findings were founded during the Golden Age of Islamic civilization, studies and exchange of ideas which then form the basis of the Renaissance in the Western civilization.

I actually find a lot of what Prof Peterson talk about very relatable, because they contain very similar values to my religion. They may be packaged differently, but in essence the same.

I probably will get a lot of hate comments here for my belief, but that is my truth, and I am not running away from it. I just hope that people will accord me the courtesy of open discussion without any prejudice."

UggvqmdOZAZ443gCoAEC,Verbal Learning,1503284815655,"It doesn't have much to do with the bible but watching this video made me think of something that i feel a need to articulate and i can't think of any other place to do it than here since this video inspired the thoughts.

But at some point in this lecture Peterson said (which he's said before) that he believes a society should have the group be subordinated to the individual and it made me wonder if there was a way to consolidate left wing policies such as welfare with the notion of keeping the group subordinate to the individual and that journey of thought lead me to wonder if the best way to execute on the concept of welfare (assuming it's a good thing to do that can help people, you can disagree or argue with that assumption if you want) would be to make it the most efficient system we could muster but basing it on voluntary effort as supposed to mandatory/force. One itteration of that would of course be charity, which many throughout time have suggested as the institution to address welfare, but i have my personal doubts to whether or not a voluntary charity is enough to alleviate the suffering of the individuals in their time of need (not saying it can be sufficient, i'm just not sure). 

Following that made me think of a possible opt-in tax that let's say increases your taxes by idk 2-5% (throwing out random numbers) and the money pooled together by said tax goes specifically to organize and help those people who'se lives have succumb to chaos and are incapable of getting it back in order by themselves (while i believe people can accomplish many things by themselves i still think it's realistic to acknowledge that not all people are equally capable of sorting their own lives out without some sort of guidance or structure that they themselves may not be able to erect) and only the people who opted in to this system are allowed to reap the benefits of said system. Which at least on some level means that no matter how many people opt in, it should possibly be able to cover, as only those who pay in can recieve money back, so the fewer the people the less money is needed to cover any given person (but of course there'd also be less funds) and vice versa if more people opt in.

And if you want to keep people bounded by responsiblity and not just have this pool of money work as ""handouts"" or money without obligations one could add stipulations to that money that demands it be spend towards sorting out ones life, aka getting back towards a more ordered way of being as opposed to spending towards maintaining hell by adding more coal to the furnace that sustains the flames of hell that despite keeping you warm also burn you alive.

So maybe the money has to be spend on let's say a psychologist, maybe a life coach or personal trainer, maybe a nutrionist, a biblical scholar, an internship, an education. Something that could help creating a meaningful goal and meaningful routines in your life that could help re-orient yourself in life so that you can come back and participate in society again as a functional member that partakes in and adds value to the culture and the economy as opposed to ""merely draining resources""

If one wanted to be even stricter to make sure this money isn't wasted you could even add the demand that the person whose life is in ruins has to be examined and talk to a doctor or a psychologist who in dialogue together with the person has to figure out what the reason for their loss of direction in life was, and if they conclude that there were no real or tangible external factors pressuring the individual into chaos and thus their sitaution is primarily self caused then said person isn't eligible for their welfare benefits. But if there is a deeply rooted issue that perhaps isn't immediatly apparent that is dug out through these preliminary discussions then the person is allowed to go through the system and recieve their welfare. Heck it doesn't even have to be state run in my mind, ideally i think it might even be best if there's both a state run and private run companies that offer this service of i guess you could call it ""life sorting insurance"" so that there's competition and options across the board for everyone in the society to choose from.

I'm sure there's plenty of nuances that i've both glossed over and missed(due to varying degrees of ignorance i'm sure), but these are my most recent thoughts on the topic and are by no means set in stone.

P.S sorry for any lack of punctuation or uncorrected typos that may increase the difficulty of reading and comprehending my wall of text. I may come back and edit it later as punctuation isn't one of my strong suits and as such it would likely drain a lot of my energy to get through it. So to qoute peterson from near the end of the video ""i'm all out of brain"" therefore this will have to do for now."

Post-Modernism is the reinvention of Marxism. Marxism is the secularized adaptation of Abrahamic spirituality = Judaism, the mother, fertilized by Hellenism and Egypt and Zoroastrianism, to give birth to Christianity and Islam.  
Abrahamism is the psychological relationship of man to cosmos where vulnerability, weakness, fear,  forces a pulling away, a going back into self to escape, projecting, as a child cries for a parent, human constructs which it then demands to exist,,.. when the child realizes that these concepts do not exist, and are its own constructs, it chooses them over the world,  which is now deemed 'negative' realm - Nihilism.

If you defend religion you're defending things like islam. based on JP's definition of truth being something that useful....which isn't what truth is and Sam Harris did a good job of putting JP in his place on that one.....but if you think islam is either true or useful i think you are probably pretty stupid and you shouldnt even be involved in discussions on important topics. Jordan MUST get away from his religious upbringing and become an individual. only if we all become true individuals and work together as individuals instead of a mob or a cult we will ever evolve to the point where we need to be for our species to survive and thrive. i hope Jordan does DMT with Joe Rogan, maybe thats what he needs to see past his indoctrination?"

By way of analogy, for example, imagine what would happen in Jewish or Islamic communities around the globe if Jewish or Islamic beliefs and values suddenly disintegrated. Surely, this would mean a profound loss of identity; a loss of bearings and direction; a return to a kind of No Mans Land. And why shouldn't the same be true in the formerly Christian West?For the beliefs and values of any society are as integral to that society as its political and judicial institutions or its approaches to learning and the arts. Indeed, as we move into the  "" post-Christian era "" arent many of us only too aware that we do, in fact, appear to be returning to "" a Kind of No Mans Land 'as all the beliefs and values of the past questioned,if not discarded-with repercussions all down the line for theWestern society,not just for people who still go to church on Sunday?

And while some may say that ""ignorance is bliss "" so why worry about all that?- the reality is that ignorance is impotence: Ignorance is blindness: ignorance is an accident waiting to happen! Its living in the dark,  not knowing or caring-whas going to happen, and therefore being totally unprepared for whats already hammering at the front door. In any other situation for parents,for children, or for any business venture that is going to survive- ignorance is not bliss; so why should it be "" bliss "" to be ignorant about what is happening or likely to happen to the fundamental beliefs and values ofWestern society?"

Will the environment survive the onslaught of modern industry? Will the terrifying weapons of war that we have forged over be used and if so, how many can hope to survive? Will there be life on other planets?And how far will todays Space Program takes us out into wider universe...?

UgiE6ybfu5Me2HgCoAEC,John D,1503284827286,"1:26:04 - ""you're called upon to believe things that no one can believe"" 
Um....no. That's not true. Plenty of people believe the stories in the Bible. If they did not, the Bible really wouldn't be important, would it? 
I'm afraid this task is beyond Peterson's ability. He's placed himself in materialistic shackles at the start, and will, at best, attempt to wrench the biblical narrative into the cramped world view he's put himself in. It won't work - not if you look at these stories honestly and not change what they say.
EDIT: at the end of the talk Dr. Peterson acknowledges that he's working these thoughts out, so I should be more charitable in judging what he's saying."
UgjJ06Js0Sq6OHgCoAEC,John D,1503284827293,"57:40 - ""this is the chaos that God wrestles with at the beginning of time.""
Well, not quite. There is a small but extremely significant difference between what Dr. Peterson says here and what the actual text of Genesis says. 
God doesn't wrestle at all with Chaos. He has complete control over it. He speaks, and the chaos changes into order.
This is a huge difference between Genesis and other creation myths. There is no violence in Genesis's creation myth. No battle, no slaying. THAT is what makes Genesis different, and perhaps that is what made this story endure while the other stories faded. 
The thing God DOES wrestle with is man. 
And that is really the story of the Bible - not man constructing something, but God wrestling with Man. I wonder if Dr. Peterson will grasp that in the upcoming lectures."
UgirrP_M8EqLWngCoAEC,John D,1503284827302,"As a Christian, this sounds to me (especially around 49:25) like an atheist trying to explain the Bible. What I mean is that Dr. Peterson is already assuming that there's no God, no revelation, and everything in this story can be explained by evolutionary urges. As a Christian I have two questions: 
A) why should I listen further? 
B) why is Dr. Peterson closed to the possibility that God does exist, and that there was some kind of revelation?"

To what extent does the human mind create truth? Is it to the extent that it is disciplined by it? 

Pilate's prophetic cynicism was to swat truth away as a playful pest of humankind. His wife was more receptive to transcendent visitation. That is not to imply that the feminine surpasses the masculine in wisdom and righteousness; today's post-modern militant feminists are testament to that narcissistic conceit. 

Dr. Peterson, will you convene a symposium with RZIM--including Ravi Zacharias and Dr. John Lennox--to explore the four major world view questions: origin, meaning, morality and destiny?

I realize that this inquiry is way beyond the totalitarianism of our times for secular statists and sectarian Islamists, so your foundational restoration needed for most to understand the points of human deviations will take some time. However, you are already equipped for the interchange which could be presented publicly at the appointed time.

Instead of meshing the two worlds harmoniously I found a new level of inner conflict and turmoil I didn't anticipate. By luck, grace, chaos, and chance or whatever other parameters you can slap on it, I have found the way Dr. Peterson is exploring this with an undefined destination or conclusion helpful beyond measure.

UgjTQp7VLaxF8ngCoAEC,perceivingacting,1503284835160,"Great Dr Peterson to see you have added JJ Gibson's phenomenological, non-representational approach of ""The ecological approach to visual perception"" to your reading list:
https://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/great-books/ 
Ironic he's under ""neuroscience"". His approach is definitely NOT neuroscience although many neuroscientists have now turned to him for guidance - to ask WHAT is detected and WHAT is perceived without neural preconceptions about what counts as ""input"". Gibson's approach of direct perception is all about information-based perception - sensations (neural events) are ""irrelevant for the understanding of perception"". Perception is understood to be based on information, often taken to mean ""external"" structure - higher-order invariants (mathematical constancies) in energy distributions (light, sound, etc). But this is not quite right. The ecological approach (EP) emphasizes organism-environment mutuality - the reciprocity of organism and environment. Perception is of ""affordances"" (perceivable opportunities for action""), not of sensations, shapes, forms, or any of the usual ""inputs"" assumed to exist for ""information processing"". There is no processing as such. The mechanism intuited by Gibson beginning in the mid-60s was one of ""resonance"". But the notion of internal representations, images, inside the head and typical cognitive structures is complete anathema to Gibson and his followers' approach. Anyway, it's good to see you are aware of Gibson who is a heretic by the standards of status quo cognitive science.

Importantly, EP asks not what's inside your head but what your head's inside of (Bill Mace). To that extent, I believe EP prepares the grounds for a radically different approach to understanding mind that is compatible with more ancient conceptions, eg, Gnostic approaches. Mind is not inside the head. Our experience is occurring in a far more radical way...perhaps it really is as a dream - not ours, but that of Gaia, or Sophia, the ancient goddess of the Gnostics. I suggest you read John Lash's analysis in ""Not In His Image"" of the Nag Hammadi texts and of Gnostic and Pagan thought in general. It goes far beyond the highly edited and censored, distorted, and incomplete fairy tales of the extant ""Bible"" and is compatible with your interest in mythology, Jung, and the origins of consciousness. The big question is WHAT IS INFORMATION...and WHERE is it? Your recent lectures on the Bible hints at dreams as an important touchstone. This is great.

Perhaps in your brand new series of lectures on the Bible you will develop these issues in some detail - Gibson's ecological emphasis on information as a basis for behaviour, and, although Gibson explicitly denied his approach as support for any kind of ""world soul"" (his words in TEATVP79), because his approach was in the practical tradition of American pragmatism, I do believe EP provides a basis to better comprehend the mystery of consciousness - by extending it with a concept of information compatible to the Gnostic myth of Earth's origins - Galactic emanations (electric universe theory), Sophia and the fallen goddess scenario (see Lash), the anomalous creation of the trickster - the demiurge (Yaweh), and how all religion has been perniciously corrupted and distorted by the deceptions of the latter. I call this ""Gaian information""."

""The most comprehensive term which conveys each of the qualities of God, if not love, is consequence (...)What this means is that every thought and every action that has ever occurred or will ever have occurred in the universe is the consequence of God’s will. It is not simply enough to say that God is in control of the universe. God is the universe and the universe is God, but God is also more than the universe because he always encompasses his abstract will.

UggQaoqxOxeX93gCoAEC,Steven A,1503284838829,"You have to remember that us monkeys have only RECENTLY in terms of our existence, in the past few millennia have been given the gift of literacy, the ability to read and write our thoughts, so who knows for how long us humans have been trying to utter meaning through order and chaos. So you can view religion and the bible as the first accounts of humans trying to understand the good and bad of not only the world, but also the People of the world. It was the first attempt at evaluating human psychology, in some written kind of form. Now this yes as Peterson says makes it to be a very important document for mankind that cannot go unnoticed with almost the newage of Anti-God atheists (I have nothing against atheists because I see myself too as a rational believer of history but I do not ignore the historic significance of Christ. There must have been something so meaningful about religions that have allowed people to live harmoniously or positively).

You could say that artists are the people at the edge of every era or time period taking notes and re-painting lets say about how life was lived through the artists' perceptions, and trying to shape their ideas and around that. In every mode of life there is the anomaly of suffering (or chaos), but what humans can teach other humans is that there is also a deep meaning that is taught to people to show them how they can overcome their own limitations if they realize that the world is Me vs Me rather than Me vs World because Life just moves on(or it won't for you if you don't want it to). This just confirms that in every (well, most people, there can be multiple endless factors to why a person can't do something or are poor)person they are aristocratic in the most fundamental sense, everybody is their own King or their own father and everyone has to climb up a their own personal ladder to reap the rewards of living, surviving, paradise that oneself is providing (Now this sounds very simple, but no one ever in life said that life was ""simple"", yet at the same time you cannot hide the truth of the blind pampered King. 

So coming back to the snake that may arise at any moment in chaos or in yourself, the bible helps describe the first accounts of what ""good"" and what ""evil"" may be like in people, and the Only measure of that, is by the truth because what else do we have? Deception doesn't work at all.

99% of your pain and suffering in life is mental and just thoughts arise, now you can never blame thought arising. But what you can is making the wrong conscious decisions. That 1% you can barely feel so most of the overthinking done is a means to remedy your current situation, I mean it is your psyche literally telling you that something is wrong. It's when you don't do shit you leave yourself unfulfilled and can drown in unnecessary thought and depression. The best alleviation of that is to try to balance your Psyche and your equilibrium so you can somehow combat the suffering to actually feeling better about yourself. And young people all experience it basically when they are old enough to be responsible for their own actions. and life is all about learning how to deal with that.

I think our consciousness nowadays can sometimes forget the fact that it easy to dismiss the amount of history and all the science that has built our foundation of thinking, but every now and again like the Human spirit (which I think was ultimately created by religion), its the hope that sufferers pray to. The father we never knew watching us fall and rise (I'm not saying this is true), but maybe all the words that we implicitly know and use uttered by our ancestors was a means to find MEANING in life and to push on no matter what. Suffer when you don't take responsibility, but don't carry that burden and make yourself incompetent.

Ugg4k_OHSNgbS3gCoAEC,Hevander75,1503284842664,"51:15  to 51:36 there a direct biblical connection with this idea. I haven't fully read the bible. However I do know that the first time god came in a ""human vessel"" (as interpreted) he wrestled with a man named Jacob. Jacob first the thought the man was his brother coming but saw that it wasn't an that this man was someone with some sort power, Jacob wouldn't let go if until the man blessed him. When the sun began to rise the man touch Jacobs hip and it came out of the socket but the Jacob wouldn't let go until the man blessed him. The man (god in a vessel) gave him a new name ""Israel"" (which mean Triumphant with god). Israel was first a man, then It become his tribe, then It became a nation. The nation symbolized god's union with Israelites . Jesus came essentially states that union with god is open to the world not just the Israelites, Israel become god's union with humanity. The idea of Israel became more abstract which aloud it to become global. Interestingly the opposite is done with Jesus in the christian tradition ,""the word that was with and part of god"". If I remember correctly in revelation Jesus is said to be: ""the light with and part of god "", "" the light put into the universe"", he was prophesied as the messiah,  as well as he was said to be the tent that god descended to to speak to interact with I think Abraham, finally he became a man and god at the same time."

Also some of the videos of peoples pupils going slit dont seem to be fake, some of course are but so what i could make a fake mobile phone doesnt mean mobile phones dont exist. Look at the video of George Bush senior on CNN with reptilian eyes, there are others like that, i also watched some porn once where the womans eyes were morphing...that was many years ago and i dont see why anyone would put that in porn.

UgiH_qxuPKiXqHgCoAEC,Germán Rivas,1503284847005,"As I intuitively asserted, Gods is a semantic and very clever construction to represent and deal with the contingency of the universe and the sense of uncertainty (our vulnerability) against it, when you see God from that perspective not only the Christianity and Islam seem more Stoic or Taoist but the whole thing of christian culture seems / is completely flawed because the sense of ""join with the father"" is more related with that of enlightenment of the Buddha, so being a lamb is completely wrong because perpetuates dependency (there it is the political secret ...) and more than all that, it is at the end another philosophy because is based on a rational construct (a semiotic symbolic construction) so I could say that we can be atheist and being ""religious"" (in this case christian) at the same time because the whole concept of atheism misaddress the whole problem of religion that is living with irrationality , and not the language that builds a dogma to explain the reality. This is observed in the book ""the Devil's advocate"" by Morris West where the transition through confusion of the saint and the evolution of the father have to be with this process known in semiotics as meaning-making and deal with all this ontology about the reality and our power to deal with it or not."
Uggp1rD0PfoUtHgCoAEC,Joe Foster,1503284847022,"I love Petersons work, but he will fall short at the end with his quest for the truth if he continues the same path he is on now. Reason is he is placing his faith in pure Rationality to explain the reason for spiritual and divine phenomenon. Rationality hits a brick wall because the work of God is beyond rationality and existence itself (otherwise it wouldn't be God), only way to actually know God is to be one with him.. 

My recommendation to Peterson would be to spend sometime with the Orthodox Christian Monastics in a Monastery in simple prayer and fasting and learn from them, after about a year of that he will have a different perspective and might be able to explain this concept in deeper substance and will learn more about the depth of Christianity. With that spiritual experience and his fantastic rational mind he would be able describe reality to all of us in a much deeper sense. 

So far he is doing a wonderful job, but he will forever be limited in his endeavors until he actually personally encounters Christ himself. It really is that simple."

I now position myself as a CHRISTIAN ATHEIST > the belief that the bible is a phenomenologically and existentially accurate representation of Being-in-the-world, while simultaneously finding the notion of a metaphysical god's existence to be barren. I would call myself CHRISTIAN because I strive to be the manifestation of the morality that emerges from the bible, but an ATHEIST because I lack the belief in a real god. I believe there will be a resurgence of the morally religious, but believe that they will be the atheist bunch adopting the emergent moral systems of religious texts as a result of their extreme existential utility. How this man can make me what seems like a bloody paradox is beyond me. But i think if you think hard enough about it, the christian and the atheist are not mutually exclusive.

No one observed any of the things science claims about our ancient history. No one has even observed the actual half-lives of the elements we use to date rocks (not to mention the presuppositions required for radiometric dating).

Based on this lack of observation of biology, geology, and astronomy, I find the proof of the age of the universe wanting. It's unsettled because it lacks the primary rule that determines truth scientifically: observation. Observing a theoretical model is not the same as observing reality. 

I'm far more inclined to believe people who lived closer to the origin of the world than modern scientists. This just so happens to be religious in nature.

I hope Mr. Peterson sees this comment, because for such an intelligent man, this is the one obvious flaw I see in his arguments. His worldview would have to pivot radically if he acknowledges the lack of scientific observation behind these specific sciences.

And note: this is not to say science is wrong about everything. Science is correct about the things that are observable, testable, and repeatable. Note that history falls outside of this structure. But things that are observable and provable through the scientific method are where science shines through."

Basically the Jewish people came up with the idea of monotheism or the belief in one god. The Zoroastrians of the Iranian region may have influenced Judaism. The middle east was a hotbed of religious ideologies and there are archeological sites in Israel of what happened to competing beliefs. The Bible is full of stories that were passed down from Sumarian and Assyrian civilizations and possibly Egyptian. Today we live in a Secular world where politics and the law are separate ideas from religion or belief. The Bible is the Law Religionized and deals with all of humanities based traits. Own Group Preference etc. The Bible and the Koran are War Manuals imo and and are both Middle Eastern Ideologies. Christianity swept away Paganism or Nativism as I prefer to call it in Europe. The belief in multiple gods or Polytheism. The letters of the Alphabet are derived from everyday things ancient peoples found around them in the Assyrian and Aramaic languages. E.g the letter A is an inverted head of a cow or goat. God is also Alpha."
UgiQFdX9BlE7HngCoAEC,Steven Weight,1503284857225,"I'm very interested in this lecture series, but I'm afraid the empirical framework is going to be vastly constraining, unless empiricism becomes refined in a much deeper metaphysics, which the bible itself does provide by the understanding of its incredibly powerful philosophical-sophistication (mostly in the new testament)... which is by no means easy to decipher (it is first encountered as a secret mystery, until the mystery of God should be finished). Sadly, to get the spiritual tradition into a neat framework, many issues will get horribly tarnished by an obtuse treatment or interpretation, until re-read with the complete synthesis in mind; the synthesis which itself is part of the refinement process prescribed in the new testament, a process that is roughly paralleled by Jung's style of therapy, although Jung himself developed his thinking on the subject quite well, his inability to incorporate the full functionality of a church (church meaning the complete set of gifts put to work by the communion on the living soul— of the members in particular), was a missed opportunity, but Jung was always a bit covert in his reliance on Christianity: his famous phrase— what you resist, persists, is perhaps an obvious inversion for the ""give and it will be given"" verses, which even include directly the redounded aspects within action.

Hoping if Jordan Peterson reads my comment, if nothing else, I would offer two definitions which I like to use in my understanding of the Christian scriptures, as the specifics of the knowledge I have gleamed is couched in my own theory of mind and deep psychology, but I would like to offer two of my fundamental tools for bridging the metaphysics of the Scripture into psychological terms:  

definitions and general notes~

Spirit: definition- ""the heading that a purpose has""; or said another way- the latent 'metaphysical' direction within the purpose (thus when the doctrinal discussion in the bible starts getting heavy, you can start to relate ""spirit of man"" = spirit of the vessel (a.k.a the fleshly thought) vs. the ""spirit of God""= the spirit of truth, these pairings are generally synonymous in the bible, although they are referred to by different grammar to make the issue being explored more directly accessible: it is my contention that much of the 'literal' inconsistency of the bible is due to lacking proper understanding of what's being communicated, and if you are reading an inconsistency, your filter of interpretation is what is generating the apparent error, because it's stopping you from moving into a deeper consideration of the 'spiritual dynamic' being described (and you've not put in enough work to arrive at the meaning that's worth considering)).

God: I often don't focus on this concept too much, especially because its an atheist triggering-word, but its important to note that the bible refers to the word God very-very differently while also using it quite differently also. Sometimes when God is mentioned, the focus is on the understanding of god from a purely philosophical (semi-objective framework, God-the ultimate, in relation to itself), this is kindof important to distinguish between what is being said about the actions of God relative to it-self, and then relative to the subjective perspective of the proper vessel of God (man) renders quite a different confusing account,— if these matters aren't investigated as separate, but also inter-related subjects. It is my contention that properly understood, the word ""God"" simply means: 'the authority';— the word God is even used in the bible to name the devil (i.e ""God of the world""- is the title given to Satan in the scriptures, ""god of the world""/""spirit of 'the vessel' (the vessel being: ""man""/flesh), is the best way to conceive of the deepest and most essential nature of deception: the god of lies/the world.), which correctly describes the limited authority that 'the devil' obtains (so already, one should understand the doctrine includes a massive distinction between 'the world' and the 'earth'— which contains important layers of analysis when understanding the relationship between Christ and Christ-consciousness to 'the world', and how the 'world is overcome'; and what the Kingdom of God properly entails: and how little it means to the world in general, and how vastly important it is to the subjective experience of those who are ""chosen of/decided on"" the truth). 

The major style of contribution in form of parable: parables make an illustration of internal considerations; this is why so many parables are overlooked and sorely misunderstood grievously, because they are 'mined' for literal significance, when its only the composition of the considerations that's being codified. [the woman who feeds the dogs the scraps of food, because the dogs are hungry also... and implicitly a starving dog can also become like a wolf].

If anyone would like to join a discussion group on these and related matters, centering around psychology and philosophy, please join me on: https://discord.gg/NGbusjR   The focus is much in vein of Jordan Peterson's discussion with Sam Harris (so atheists welcome), but also the psychological grammar of religious systems, (including alchemy) and other related philosophical matters.

See what I did there was post an opinion in the comments section of a non-time-sensitive video-posting/hosting website. Why do I say that as though it is news or like it matters? The answer is below.

Tips for asking questions as an audience member [as based on things that annoyed me in this video]:
1)If you're an adult, speaking in public, try not to say ""like"" more than one time per conversation.
2) If hundreds of people come to hear one person speak (and that person is not you), don't waste time [re]stating the obvious; such as how pleased you are to be there, and/or that the event happened, or your opinion [on anything].
2a) Try to be considerate of the situation, (you aren't on the internet, but you WILL be when the recording of you is posted for everyone to watch repeatedly and critique);
 it's more courteous not to be as self-centered when there is a limited amount of time for all the people present to interact with the speaker.  For example: Don't waste everyone's' time asking the speaker something [like their opinion on a complex ""idea/theory""] requiring a great deal of preamble, explanation, and/or disclaimer, etc. If you need to say 350 words to posit a question, and you need to include your own opinions in it as well, then I would argue that you probably need to work on your question a bit more, since that is what you are doing with all that prefacing- thinking aloud- and we didn't come to hear you think out loud."

He has done a very insightful comparative study of the ancient Hebrew culture and ancient near east cultures. One of the points he makes especially regarding the first 5 chapters of Genesis is that modern culture often tries to shoe-horn in a material ontology into Genesis 1-5. He makes the argument that Genesis is as far from Cosmogony as it can possibly get, especially in the minds of the cultures that the stories sprang out of. Specifically because they (ancient cultures) were not materialist philosophers, instead these ancient cultures understood their stories as functional ontology, and that Genesis is a defining of functions and an assigning of the functions to their functionaries, communicated most effectively through a poetic narrative structure. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this perspective."

Just like alternative or ""independent"" art, the mystical art of interpretation places the burden directly at the door of the enquirer. What mystics tend to articulate is more something that they have discovered for themselves, thus recognising the fundamental importance of the process in which they arrived at such an interpretation. This is why Jesus spoke in parables, and why mystics use metaphors (art). They speak from a position of power and yet are completely outside of the pre-existing power hierarchy. So you might ask ""Where do they get their sense of power?""

By bypassing their own thinking minds. And that's why we have our own particular dreams, because that's the only dammed opportunity that our personal and more informed subconscious gets to communicate with our conscious perception. Dreams are like an inner mystic attempting to communicate with us.

Jordan. The noble aim is unconditional love. What you reduce the story of Jesus to, as ""True speech"", can equally be reduced as ""True compassion"". I think both sentiments are essentially 2 sides of the same coin!"

By comparison we can know why this book became this book. the bible is not truth. it is fable. the only reason it has lasted is because governments used it against their own people. anyone can make up an excuse for anything they find in the bible and its opposite. it is not profound, it is not the axis of the world. Alexander  conquered the world and taught hillbillies how to think in a logical manner. in 1493 did the native americans come to the realization that the bible was the word of god or did they just survive the holocaust and opt in for survival.... answer that and you can save 2 hours and 38 minutes of your life."

they are on the run, in the desert out of any force structure. so law is the shell around, when people don't follow the ethic, then immediately fall into the law, no pharao any human pyramid cant bring ethic it is something you should force it on yourself, this is the way to freedom, later you don't consume unnecessary law institute (police, school and law) , rather a community institute with can negotiate base on ethics and infinite value

UghX9gUM-dU2BHgCoAEC,Lttlemoi,1503284868058,"I don't think the metaphor is true enough nor did it take a long time to figure out. I think in earlier societies and even in groups of animals, the behavior of not valuing the life of the others within the group as a divine thing was simply selected away because these groups are less able to compete for survival than groups of weaker animals that work together. In a group where everyone has complete disregard for the other members, each individual must be able to compete and survive on its own. The more people work together, the more lenient survival becomes towards the fallibility of the individual.
The reason it took so long to codify into literature is because at the point where human history begins, such groups with no internal regard for life no longer existed nor were able to last long. It wasn't really until the industrial revolution where it once again became possible to subjugate people in such a complete way, because it requires for a very small group of people to have total control over the abilities of the masses. This is near impossible without high impact weapons such as guns and high throughput of goods and ideas (motorized transport and radio).
I don't think there is an inherent difference between, say, slavery and the communist society. In regular slavery, which was practiced nearly everywhere in the ancient world, people are considered private possessions of another individual. Communism merely takes this a step further and makes everyone the slave of the state.

When you look at the behavior between groups, it becomes immediately clear that most ancient societies did in fact not put any value on the lives of those outside the group."

UgioeVQN8YJOIngCoAEC,Human Dugong,1503284869584,"Some of these questions have an answer, unless I'm missing something.

""Can the universe exist without human consciousness?"" Answer: clearly yes, since palaeontologists and cosmologists are daily finding evidence of the existence of objects which predate the advent of human consciousness, or in some cases of any sort of consciousness. If things needed a beholding consciousness in order to come into existence, the existence of such objects would be ruled out.

""If there is no God, why shouldn't I act like a sociopath?"" Sociopathy is not a choice you make: it is a piece of brain wiring you lack. The sociopath can dedicate himself to hurting and exploiting others because he lacks capacity for empathy (and he will do so whether or not there is a ""God""). For the rest of us, this is not an option. Our self-interest is too tightly bound up with the welfare of the tribe, or in some cases (narcissists and the like) with the real or imagined approval of the tribe. Most of us happen to be configured to be tribal animals, not solitary predators. Granted, experimental results show that people act less morally when they believe they are not being ""watched"", which probably accounts for the love affair between, say, the UK govt and CCTV cameras. But a crisis of faith does not generally lead to anarchy, provided there are social structures already in place to take the strain. Instead, people look for an alternative system of morality. This may be provided by an overt political ideology (e.g. socialism or libertarianism) but more often will be a covert ideology or value system such as the sentimental humanism purveyed by Hollywood. People take their cue from whatever sort of residual moral values appear to be prevalent in the surrounding society and its privileged mouthpieces, and this does for us until or unless we are faced with some extreme dilemma (and society is set up precisely to avoid most of us ever being faced with such dilemmas). Again, most of us are tribal conformists at heart.

Additionally: history shows that belief in a God does not prevent people from acting with extreme cruelty to others - in fact, it seems to encourage such cruelty, wherever there is an out-group to practise it upon. Most of the deliberate bloodshed currently happening on the planet is being pursued in the name of some religion or other.

Admittedly, there are let's say tendencies or signs in some contemporary societies of a forthcoming crisis of values - due not so much to a crisis in religious faith as to the effects of globalisation - in which an established religion could serve a useful socially cohesive purpose. But as Dr Peterson himself admits at one point, obtaining social cohesion at the cost of being forced to believe patent absurdities (in which category I would place the entirety of Christian dogma, though I'm open to persuasion) isn't really an option. The ideal solution would be a socially cohesive global religion without any metaphysical baggage, some sort of consensual set of enlightened humanistic core values, but I don't see this as a realistic option either (pace the Dawkinses of this world), which is why I don't expect human civilization to last more than another hundred years or so, after which the 4 horsemen will very likely take over and finish us off."

I became an atheist following the rules of investigating the world and our experience in it in a rational and rule based fashion. But instead of laying down the tools when I reached that point I kept going and in a bizarre fashion it all started twisting back on itself and i found myself moving back towards mythology (reading Prof Bellah's Religion in Human Evolution made a huge impact). Turned out atheism demanded a very one dimensional and edited approach to understanding what is real and true as well as the human experience, and that was anathema to my need for an emotional and full appreciation of my life. But I'm just an artist and don't have the tools or time to elaborate it into such a concise and clear framework. My greatful thanks for the work that Dr Peterson has done to open the human mind."

Ugh2ZXek_PocvXgCoAEC,Northernmight,1503284873840,"Now, i don't know if you read comments on your youtube, but i'll give it a try! I've always wondered, when you speak about religion - if the admittedly beautiful and thought provoking metaphors your derive from it - that's all well and good, and as i said, is both beautiful and thought-provoking, however, the people who, in general, make up the religion, are usually not seeing these metaphors that you are. I mean, you can speak to all the great elements in christianity that you see, but if the vast majority of christians have never even thought of these things, can you really call your intepretation ""Christian"" in the least?

I haven't even heard damn pope, supposedly the biggest religious figure on earth, express anything close to what you are.
to me it seems like it either has to be ""The eye of the beholder"" you extract these things from the religion, because you're just that intelligent - i mean, you seem to extract much same kind of things, at will, from all kinds of other sources, be it Disney, Harry Potter, and what not. Perhaps it says more about your own mind, than the sources themselves - either that

OR - the beautiful things you see are really there, but are put across so ineffectively in the texts, that the VAST majority of people following, studying and living by these texts seem to miss them completely, which, i would say, doesn't really speak to the greatness of said texts.

Either way, i suppose it doesn't really matter - whatever motivates you to speak the brilliant words you do, power to ya - it's just something that's been crossing my mind."

Preamble to the Bill Of Rights:
""Whereas Canada is Founded On The Principles Of The Supremacy Of God And The Rule Of Law""

The Canadian BAR & The American BAR are the same thing, BAR means ""British Accredited Registry"" and only has ""Jurisdictional Authority"" over that in which they author & sign for; the Surety Bond (Birth Certificate Person)

FUCK the LAWYERS! here is how to get out of this:

“POINT OF ORDER” / “NOTICE OF MISTAKE”

[first of all before the “Judge” can finish speaking, interrupt with:] 

“POINT OF ORDER”

[after they must wait say:]

“i: a man, claim all rights, is there any objection from the court?”
wait a few seconds… 

“i: a man, claim all rights, is there any objection from the court?”
wait a few seconds…

“i: a man, claim all rights, is there any objection from the court?”
wait a few seconds… 

“as such,  let the record show that i wish and verify to said record my notice of mistake:
 
notice of mistake
in the matter of surety for the legal name, i: a man, claim that there has been a mistake as the sole beneficiary has been incorrectly identified as the accused.  if i, and/or persons and/or friends of the court and/or such other parties acting in my interests,  have led the court to believe by responding to “you”  and/or such other identification this court has addressed me as, that i am the party with surety in this matter, then that would be a mistake and please forgive me. as i have no knowledge of who “you” and/or such other identification this court has addressed me as, i respectfully ask; by what authority is the court addressing me as such? as the surety bond (birth certificate) has been deposited into the court, what evidence does the court have that i, as the sole beneficiary of the trust have any surety in this matter? as the government is the sole signatory party on the surety bond (birth certificate), with sole and full surety as trustee for the legal name, what evidence does the court have that i am a trustee for the legal name?  what evidence does the court have that i am a trustee and have any surety with respect to the legal name? what evidence does the court have that i am an officer, an agent, a trustee or an employee of the crown? what evidence does the court have of any warrant of agency for the principal? what evidence does the court have that there has been any meeting of the minds, any proper notice given, any considerable consideration offered, or that i have any intent to contract in this matter? as such, i am returning your offer, declined, for immediate discharge and closure.


hand them a piece of paper with the above notice of mistake hand written on it, speak as little as possible, do not read the notice because your words mean nothing to them. the “i: a man, claim all rights, is there any objection from the court?” part is said 3 times, is on purpose, this effectively cements your claim (only a man can make a claim, a corporate owned person has to make a charge) leaving no doubt to as your (pronoun) intentions. YOU is a NOUN to them and we assume that it means a PRONOUN. 

Legalese English is Etymologically Based, this is because ""Etymon"" means ""True Sense"" and ""-ology"" is ""the study of"" so etymology is ""The study of the true sense of a word through tracing its origin"", there are no synonyms/homonyms in law. if there is a dispute on a words meaning, the oldest/original sense of that word must set precedent on meaning in the interest of true justice. This is why lawyers are needed because the Modern English that we speak and write today is Folk-Etymology. 

By Folk-etymology is meant the influence exercised upon words, both as to their form and meaning, by the popular use and misuse of them. In a special sense, it is intended to denote the corruption which words undergo, owing either to false ideas about their derivation, or to a mistaken analogy with other words to which they are supposed to be related.

etymon (noun) 
""primitive word,"" 1570s, from Greek etymon, neuter of etymos ""true, real, actual"". Classical Greek used etymon as an adverb, ""truly, really.""

I say FUCK THE LAWYERS because a lawyer's true purpose is to joinder the man to the legal fiction thus granting the courts jurisdictional authority. they have no authority over man, they only have authority over the person that they author/father. in the first year of legal schooling a lawyer is taught that we can not own a name. this is fundamental to their game of misandry. ""Are YOU [noun] FIRST MIDDLE LASTNAME?"" is a trap, they are trying to gain Jurisdictional Authority (the right to say what the law is through the fact that they authored and signed the Surety Bond (Birth Certificate)) 

in Legalese a word takes on a totally different meaning. (always the original sense; etymological) the schools teach us the modern sense."

What about the view that what we are observing is how God has set things up in the act of creation and that the Bible actually is His inspired word. God needs to come first. This is a mystery of the faith and would fall into the category of those things you said at the beginning you would not attempt to explain because they cannot be explained. Fine. But in not tackling those issues at all you incorrectly put man at the helm so to speak. I think you need to be able to not tackle those issues but still frame your views in ways that put God first. Even if it's along the lines of the uncaused cause that Aquinas speaks about. Although this would seem somewhat barren. Perhaps of the idea of the personified God, such as the God of goodness, as witnessed in His acts of creation and His imputed reasons for creating, because that's what He is. This would seem not only more fruitful than the uncaused cause but truthful too."

There IS only one Thing. That Thing, is God. God is Perfect. EveryThing, is part of that Whole, which is God, because in order to be Perfect, God is EveryThing. Perfect is all-encompassing. It Is everything that could ever be. God is EveryThing. In order to be EveryThing, God became the Universe. God is the Universe. The Universe is God. You are part of the Universe. Meaning that, we are literally the image of God. You are God becoming you in order to be God. And It Is and It Is Perfect. If It wasn't Perfect It couldnt Be. Therefore, to understand and fulfill ones being is to understand the part of God one Is, hence the personal relationship with your Creator.

Of course the harder part is coming in dealing with the texts and especially sorting out the human error that has come in from the wisdom. 

One example was the Cain and Abel story where you accepted the text that said that God was not happy with Cain's sacrifice. My own guess is that he was happy with both, but he mentioned something in particular about Abel's, and that is what set Cain off. The idea of God being ""unhappy"" with a sacrifice made with good intentions (assuming this was the case), would be a pretty picky and unloving God. The point is that things that look fishing may be wrong instead of something that has to be assumed correct and wedged in. Right? My biggest problem with the Old Testament is that God comes off as a total jerk. If this is the case, I'd rather than a random universe, so that is no solution for me. That doesn't mean God can't be a proponent of tough love, but things like revenge, jealousy, mind games, etc. I personally question as blowing the case for a loving an just God."

clever enough to survive."" That means that every statement about what is true and what is not, is nonsense if your thinking operates within the framework of evolution. So because Peterson believes in evolution, he is automatically deprived the ability to establish anything as truth. So this video is 2½ hours of nonsense, spoken by an intelligent and very likeable man. 2½ hours of wasting the listener's and his own time. Belief in evolution excludes the belief in anything, because according to evolution all beliefs are solely addaptations that made survival possible. Addaptations do not hold any truth value, therefore if evolution is true we cannot possibly know if something is true, and hence the conclusion that this video is 2½ hours of nonsense."

I always love learning about religion and our past and Human history in general, and just because I don't believe in god doesn't mean that I can't learn about the concepts of religion, even Islam that I left and despise for it's dogma, and never take it seriously and learn from it's good parts! Christians and all the other religious people, not all of us atheists or non religious people hate religion to the point that we don't want to hear anything related to it! but we mostly hate it for it's dogma.

What is truth? I find his definition of that which is useful is true to be imprecise. Truth is that which is accurate, while utility is something that is beneficial.

Appeal to tradition - something is correct simply because it has always been done.
Saying that separating reason from being is a bad thing seems to ignore that only through criticism of the function of our society have we been able to improve it.

Although I agree that atheism can only exist with an accompanying ideology and there are definitely positive aspects of the Judeo-Christian stories that teach useful moral lessons, the idea that religion which has been declining for some time now can be revived without an authoritarian intervention is naive. More and more we see people who cherry pick religion for the parts they like and ignore the parts they don't.

A book comprised many books and contributors added to and edited throughout the centuries. Christianity was a rebellious group that wanted their God fashioned without the restrictions of the Jewish god, and interjecting their own philosophy of what their god might be, keeping the OT as their basis. Then the Arab world wanted their form of god and along came Allah,, and once again the OT used as a basis.

UggGVuH8O_j9RXgCoAEC,Rogerrramjet1,1503284889282,"Traditionally, civilization has been defined as the coexistence of people who come together around humanistic thoughts and feelings,and who are conscious of their being human. Since people naturally live in groups,some degree of civilization has always existed. True civilization is based on refining ones manners, thoughts, feelings and strengthening ones will power. Some identify civilization with dazzling advances and innovations in sciences and technology - from trains to spaceships, broad streets and sky scrapers to dams and nuclear power stations, telecommunication systems to electronics. But these are no more than means of an easy, luxurious life. Modern facilities can help ""modernize"" life's outward appearance, but this does not mean that people of that society are civilized. 
It also provides an environment that encourages people to develop their potentialities. And truly civilized people are those who serve their community, in particular, and humanity, in general, according to the thoughts, feelings and abilities developed and refined within that environment. 
Thus civilization is not to be sought in riches, luxury, and a comfortable life in large, richly furnished houses, or in production techniques and amount of goods consumed, for such things are no more than elements of material pleasure and physical well being. Rather, true civilization is to be found in purified thinking, refined manners and feelings, and sound views and judgments. 
Civilization lies in peoples' spiritual evolution and continuous self renewal toward true humanity and personal integrity - to realizing their full potential as the ""best pattern of creation"". People must realize that civilization is not, as some blind imitators of the West believe, something to be bought from a store and worn. Rather, it is final destination that can be reached only by following a rational way passing through time and circumstances."

It sounds to me like Peterson is looking to reestablish the core Christian belief system in order to immunize society against alien ideologies, such as the Marxist postmodernists of late. I think that we must remember, and with urgent clarity, just how pernicious and stunting the catholic church was when Christianity called the shots. It has taken the western world many long and painful centuries to finally climb outside of the dark caves of ignorance, and look at what wonders we have accomplished since that enlightenment.

Yes, the postmodernists and the Islamists present a real threat to western society, but I would rather look for smart solutions to those problems rather than rush, childlike, back under the security blanket of religion.

Yes, we can look at those Biblical stories and draw from them a great deal of moral value. But we must also learn from the mistakes of mankind, which are likewise found in those scriptures. Communism is not a certain fate, and Christianity is not a certain solution. Let us stay a little longer in the outside light and move with great hesitation back towards those deep, dark caves of ignorance."

Christianity clearly has a lot of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism in it, you see it clearly with the Johnian texts and to some degree Paul.

It seems to me that very few people are actually able to attach to people based on a fundamental morality, rather than material value. It's disgusting, really, and I think you're much too kind with your interpretation."

This moment in American politics is a witch's brew of splinter factions, and it seems like any extreme faction that manages to grab onto a plurality can rise to power with disastrous consequences. It does feel a bit like 1920s Germany.

Also I've noticed that while the dream was developing the thing I'd like to happen in the dream wouldn't happen but in fact the opposite. 
And in this dream I tried to put my hands on my face to wake up and it worked, I woke up in my bedroom. Now the amazing thing is this time, unlike the other few times, I wasn't actually awake but still dreaming. I managed to trick myself.
I am not making this shit up, it did happen. 
And also on a few occasions I could influence what I'd generally dream about by thinking and repeating in my head the thing I want to dream about just as I'm about to fall asleep. 
Now I couldn't exactly decide in great detail what the dream would be but let's say I want to dream about a certain person that person would be in my dream.

There really is no world for you to act within. 
The only world there is, is the sixfold world of seeing, heaing, smelling, tasting, touching and abstract cognition. 
There is no good reason to believe that there is a world of objects beyond our senses.
There is no good reason to believe that objectification of the 6 subjective streams (in and of awareness) is anything more than an activity of the 6th subjective stream (ie symbolic representation)

The self is the purest delusion there is. At least a Rock has something beyond the mere concept of ""rock"" which the word ""rock"" refers to. The self is a concept without any real referent beyond the thought ""I""."

However, is it not a bit arrogant to interpret ancient ""mythologies"" in such a way that said interpretation actually contradicts what the authors themselves said these ""myths"" meant? For example, the one thing that all the Abrahamic religions agree on (Hebrew, Christian and Muslim) is that their ""mythology"" is not about a principle, or even a way of living, but a personal relationship with the Transcendent; i.e., God. The Abrahamic God is the one who reveals Himself (regardless of the differences between how that revelation is worked out by its different adherents). The constant refrain of the Old Testament God is that He is the one who speaks - unlike the dumb idols worshiped by the other nations. The point being, is that these religions offer more than just a set of precepts, principles or abstract concepts, and even deny that Man on his own, can reason to God, or discover Him by meditation,. The very heart of their faith is that there is a ""Person"" who stands outside of His creation. If you take away the reality of that Person, you take away that religion.

Now you come along, and tell them, ""Because I am armed with Freud, Jung and Evolutionary theory, let me tell you what your religion really means.""  I fear you are in danger of throwing away the flesh to feast on the bones."

We may wonder how such ""crazy"" ideas came to us, but they were pre-filtered for us, using rules that we already have.
These rules are not by themselves amazing. For example, we are already good at identifying if something is strange, or pleasurable or amazing, etc. By itself it is not strange, pleasurable or amazing. But if used in the filter, it is capable of creating such things from random thoughts. 
Some drugs perhaps make the filtering malfunction, and allow even stranger things to come to the subconscious. Perhaps this is not good for us in terms of survival, because if we are consumed by the pleasures or stunned in amazments, we'd neglect things necessary for survival.

UggEKx8-kyWxF3gCoAEC,test,1503284915904,"I had a weird idea relating to a potential literal interpretation of heaven and hell from a Darwinian perspective, and I was wondering if there's anywhere I can read more about this.

The basic idea of heaven and hell seems to be that if you're a good person you'll be rewarded for all eternity in heaven, and if you're bad you'll live for all eternity in hell.

As a manifestation of some kind of soul, that seems ridiculous. But if you think about it from a Darwinian perspective, it actually makes perfect sense (to me, at this moment).

Basically the idea of living a good life leading to heaven relates to your children. You live a good life, give your children a healthy and happy life, and they'll be more likely to have children and treat them well and lead to a long chain of healthy and happy lives.

At some point, you might succumb to the devil. That corresponds to not being a productive and helpful member of society. Living with dangerous people doing dangerous things. Upping the likelihood of just having a shitty life (poor, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, etc). This will produce kids who are born into these shit situations. These kids will then lead equally unhappy lives.

We now come to the Christian idea of Jesus. A person who turns the other cheek. They are the child who gets beaten but decides to forgive and move on. To break the chain of violence by creating the healthy and happy life for their children. This kicks off another chain of going to heaven. In this sense the child is dying for his parents to redeem them.

The cycle can then repeat itself.

It seems like an idea that someone else might have investigated, unless it's just a completely stupid idea. :)"

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen copies of the Gulag Archipelago towering over his head without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the books and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent the bloody post-modernists from starving 6 million Ukrainians to death,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that makes any sense. After she scanned each book and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by raving on about how he's ""the Jungian archetypal prophet, roughly speaking"" and how she ""needs to do the damn reading and sort herself out"""

You criticise the new atheists for saying that religion is unnecessary to live well, because you say most of the morals that they hold dear are in fact religious.

But you yourself ignore many of the silly things within religious text such as only wear one type of material at a time, stone your daughter for cheating, whatever whatever, and if you are deciding on which of these rules to follow and which to ignore through your own common sense, then how is that any different then Sam Harris coming up with his own set of morals through his own common sense?"
