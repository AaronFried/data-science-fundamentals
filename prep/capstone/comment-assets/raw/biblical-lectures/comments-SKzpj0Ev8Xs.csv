Ugz7XxbB_Cg8avzxfhp4AaABAg,Dalen Carr,1533611539953,"I've been reading ""The History and Origins of Consciousness,"" which is one of the books Dr. Peterson recommends. The author spends a lot of time discussing the archetype of the Great Mother as a representation of the phase of uroboric unconsciousness in the psychological development of societies and individuals. One of symbolical effects that this uroboric existence has on developing masculine ego consciousness is described as castration. This is represented through myth but was probably carried out over time before it could be elaborated in myth symbolically. If this is anywhere near true, then the statement that ""as circumcision came to be more widely practiced, there was a proportionate decrease in the population of eunuchs"" is likely also true in a literal and archetypal sense.  If that is the case, then the decision to perform circumcision instead of full-on castration seems to indicate a symbolic negotiation with the unconscious (feminine) side of life which man depended on for its powers of fertility. Dr. Peterson, then, seems to be very correct to assert the significance  of these stories for they detail the emergence of the discriminating ego consciousness, the development of which was necessary for us to live in the advanced society that we currently enjoy.

I think these stories can serve as an indication of precisely how we chose to go about suppressing the feminine side of our consciousness  so that this evolution could occur, which might enable us to reintegrate it (or be in relationship to it?) in a healthy way. 

I'm curious to see if anyone has anything to say about these thoughts that I am struggling to develop."
Ugw3xmgJdhPeYOTl7o14AaABAg,jamie Russell,1533611539959,"The Bible indicates the earth or ""the land"" will only be inhabited by demons. Those who are Christ's will be gathered to Him upon His appearing, on the last ""day"" of history. The 1000 year period of history represented by the Sabbath of the Lord at the beginning of creation. For God will have finished His work, and Christ's ""body"" will ""be raised into heaven"". And those who oppose God shall be destroyed by the brightness of His appearing.
       And satan and his minions of rebel angels will be bound to the earth for a thousand years when it returns to the primordial chaos ""Tohoo v'Bohoo"" without form AND void, unfortunately translated in Revelation as ""bottomless pit"".
 
""As in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man,.""

""The first shall be last and the last shall be first."". 

Christ was at the beginning and while He stood on the middle of history, being born into the world, ministering to us from the highest pinnacle of time. He made the chaismus' begin it's reversal to bring the end back to the beginning. Back to the garden of God, a state prior to sin. 
      The first day God had after He created man, was His Sabbath rest .
     People get ready....


Jesus is coming. 
       As MANY, MANY scriptures in the Canon indicate, in between the certain and specific metaphors and creative uses of the OT verses repurposed in the NT, can guide the deeper understanding. 
    All you have to do is believe God and search for Him with your whole heart, and He will reveal Himself in concrete evidences. For me, revealing a cohesion in the scripture that is unexplainable less the God whos existence is simply asserted from page 1, screaming the reality of His being.
       Historys major events were indicated in the creation week by the day to day specific acts of God which hint to what He would do in His plan of salvation to bring to fruition a people that are His in his-story.
      It's right psychologically, and actually historic. And this makes good sense, considering it is God's Revelation to humanity. 
      Forget what you have assumed. Forget the ridiculous claims you have heard Christians make, forget the false doctrines of a God who tortures people forever. Isaiah was borrowed from to make a comparative claim about the state of the last days a d those who would not live on forever. 

     Christ IS COMING BACK TO THIS TINY BLUE MARBLE. And He will judge the quick and the dead.

        You matter and He has made our world and has made a way for you to be good in the best possible sense. There is no true meaning other than fulfilling your potential, in Him. My.  
      In the end, God will be all in all. Will this end your conscious existence or begin your eternal living?
      Life or death. 
CHOOSE LIFE, 
""I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes in Me shall never die. Though he might sleep, He shall live. And the second death has no power over him.""

-the Savior of mankind, the Kinsman-Redeemer.

 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
John 14


He came on time the first time. And the fact Christ is a historic person, undoubtedly, and He fulfilled what was necessary, according to scripture,  validating His claims. 
       We have MANY more verses that the sinless Son of God and the Father has given to us, promising His second coming, more so, than those which indicated His first coming. And that historic fact is solidly affirmed, if any person in the past can be affirmed.
        This IS the gospel, the GOOD NEWS.
ASK.
RECIEVE.
HE is faithful."

Dr. Peterson, I am interested in your thoughts on this? Also the idea of the mother in a double sacrifice handing her boy over for the circumcision, after the pain of bringing him into the world. Like a precursor for the boy leaving her when a man.  He is taken after 8 days from her. When my son was circumcised and taken from my  protection, there was a shift in thinking that I can now look back 17 years later and analyze.  I see the way many Jewish moms act with sons, that have gone through the traditional ceremony.  There is a responsibility that the little boy is a blessing for a short time 13 years and then you have to let them them or more so it is your obligation to let them go.  ( psychologically of course) whereas with a daughter it is different.  As the saying goes, A boy marries a wife but a daughter stays for life."

By Spiritually fasting 
By believing 
By not being double minded 
By not doubting 
By his Wisdom from the 3rd Heaven.. and not by the teaching of a man that the Holy Spirit is not in him. Man's downfall is that he believes he can find it all on his own, by his own understanding and wisdom of this earth..

So what happened to cause the law/ grace fracture line, the blood-feud that broke Israel into two kingdoms after the death of Solomon.

Quick note tho, i think its a non-sens To say "" the sacrifice of isaac "" because this sentence implies that isaac is sacrificing something, and that is not the case. In France we talk about "" la ligature d'Isaac "" that can be translated by "" the binding of isaac "" and i think thats why you should have said in this very interesting talk"
UgzoS6ffMkaoQoq3dUR4AaABAg,Steve Lux,1526872345779,"Many Christians and non-Christians basically have little understanding of Christianity.  Anyone who thinks that the laws in Leviticus or Deuteronomy, or the Mosaic laws - including the 10 commandments, should have anything to do with modern Christianity, well I don't think they understand Christ and what he taught.  In all of our important relationships with God or humanity there are just a very few things we need to keep preeminent in our minds (all from the KJV): A) Matthew 22:37; ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’  B) John 13:34; ""A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."" and to bind these together:  C) John 14:21; ""He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.""  If Christians would just keep these few concepts in mind and focus on these, then they will be led to the correct path.  Levitical laws were ancient Jewish laws, and never were official Christian laws, so they don't belong in any conversation about Christianity except as a context of the world in which Christianity was born."

1:53:11 How does circumcision as a method of sacrifice makes sense if the circumcised can't agree?
1:56:31 With the phrase from Maps of Meaning  ""you have to earn the right to identify with an idea"", how should a young person, without life experience, read and interact with the wisdom of culture and incorporate it into a structure that still is authentically their own?
2:00:13 How do you reconcile the different approaches from Eastern and Western philosophy with one another?
2:06:37  Can you expand on the Notion that you face the sins of your family all the time?
2:12:17 What is going on with censorship and what should people do about it?
2:16:46 How do you convince people to see a point in standing up?
2:21:21 What happens to society if company's like google, which controls our information, censor not only themselves but also the information they make available to the world?
2:25:17 Regarding the Book of Revelations: Why is the State referred to as female, positive and negative, while you refer to the State as Male or masculine?

UgwVswekPm2QF892Y6Z4AaABAg,div inity,1524280345798,"Thank you for sharing your time and discernment! I enjoyed this Sodom and Gomorrah XI lecture very much. I found my heart explode with joy when you mentioned their sin being the way they treated the strange as opposed to homosexuality. 
I've come to this same conclusion through my own studies. 
I have learned that over time people have sexualized the bibles most critical words, and we've fostered a civilization that is ashamed to speak about these 'inappropriate' subjects. 
The misuse of words, deliberate or otherwise, coupled with people being unwilling (or too busy) to study has really caused a mess. Twisting God's word is evils #1 tool. It is the original sin from the garden of Eden.. The serpent was subtle. He said 'surely it will not kill you' and didn't lie.. The fruit itself didn't kill them, they died as a consequence of breaking their promise with God. And really, their 'death' is what we experience as life. The fact that God uses evil to further His plan has always amused me. Satan does Gods light work. Hah. I am posting a video on twisted/misused words soon, and can't stress enough how important it is to read (& reread) so we can really understand these stories in the correct context and depth. 
We first step out on faith, and eventually reason and evidence help reveal a profound, fundamental Truth that can not be bargained with. A foundational Truth that cannot be moved. 
Oh, that's the other thing I wanted to say! You mention how Abraham sort of 'barters' with God before sending His angels to the city. I respectfully disagree with your view. God does not barter with us. He told us the end from the beginning, because since Genesis 1:1 His story was finished. God is not cleaning up our mess, God is not rearranging things based on our finite human behavior. There is nothing new under the sun. God knew Adam would eat, God knew Jesus would hang (which makes the story all the more heartbreaking), God knows all things and when we stop struggling against His will, when we walk upright through the fires of life praising God, THAT is where we find rest. Which is ironic for me, because ever since the Holy Spirit gave me that rest, I've never wanted to work harder. 
Anyway, THANK YOU! You have inspired me. Good and Evil have never had such a stage. The Kingdom is here. 
Love wins, and make no mistake the war for our souls is raging! All love."

Ugy5aN18ARlJcc71cY14AaABAg,Daniel Stevens,1524280345827,"Just adding to the end, incest being the echo of the sinned city, could it also be the old man refused to live in Zorn? He refused to adapt at the end of his life like so many old men. In doing so he left it to his family to cling to him because he made it very difficult for the daughters to lead good lives without leaving the cave? (Happy in the cave - Plato's alagory) im not saying JP is wrong im saying it could be a 2 pronged thing. Tal acted like my gramps after my gramma died, he lost all purpose (S & G) , didnt want to reintegrate back into society (Zorn) or grow and be the wise man in a new city , he retreated into a cave and forced my mum to take care of him every spare moment she had for 15 years. I think S&G were sinful for my gramps in that he was too dependent on his happiness tied to his wife, so that when she died he was far too lost, he never really had control of the ship and he only realized that when the captain of 62 years died. Incest is maybe the old man who does this and loses his city clings to his family : they carry an unnecessary and unfair burden. The ideal old man could be Daniel from the lions den story? He seemed pretty useful in his old age! Im a bible noob so go easy, but just an idea to add! :)"

Abraham believed that Elohim would be with him, by Faith. 

If your Faith is in the Almighty, He will never fail you. 

Jordan might not be a Hebrew or Aramaic scholar either, he should read the texts in Hebrew and see that it is clearly against Homosexuality. His view on it is very is not what the Hebrew says and you can ask any liberal Hebrew scholar. 

In any case, I really love what Jordan Peterson has been doing and he is close to the Truth. Watching all of this unfold has been very interesting and seeing how the invisible hand of God has guided him to this point in our history. 

In the Bible, there are many stories of people that did not believe in the God of Israel but did what was right in the sight of GOD.

Im sorry the main thing I take from this is that Lot offers his virgin daughters for strangers.

As for Lot offering his daughters I do not believe he is anticipating that the offer will be taken up but is trying to show them how appalling their behaviour is, that he is saying ""look, the utterly appalling and contemptible gang rape of my daughters would be a less serious act than you are proposing ""  - it is an attempt to shock them.

They are preying on the vulnerable. 
Laws (based on individual possession of the “spark of the divine” are enacted to protect the most vulnerable. 
A stranger or a guest is vulnerable because they are in a place they do not know and they don't know exactly how to act.  They are kind of in chaos.  
The people of Sodom as a society assumed that it was ok to abuse and violate the vulnerable individuals in the care of Lot.   The social standards that protect those that are vulnerable. So that this ""How to treat a stranger or transgressing against this spirit of Hospitality is another layer or example of the Divine law that protects individuals, and sets them as the highest or most fundamental part of the social system."
Ugyh5AZNxkGCrPAmtM14AaABAg,dan pasare,1513825953486,"To understand what Dr. Peterson is talking about from an atheist/skeptical point of view one has to fight the neuronal reflex system that has been built in that dismisses any notions related to the word ""Bible"". It is the same reflex that builds over time with the fundamentally religious when they hear ""science"".  Both categories are of people and people function similarly. A second notion that, at least helped me a lot, is that how to conceptually realize the transcendental and the reality of it. There is a very interesting experiment that I saw a couple of years ago involving a fungus. It does sound unbelievably crazy that a fungus can prove transcendental but here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czk4xgdhdY4. 

I'm trying to cut to the chase of how to view this experiment: The slime mold solves the maze. The slime mold is made out of individual cells that act in a way that is programmed in their DNA. The programming comes down through millions of years of life and death of lots of individual cells to get the mold to act like that. Their action is instinctive and the pattern of the solution of the maze is crucial for the survival of the population. The pattern is beyond the immediate understanding of the cells or of the slime mold as a whole so in that way the pattern is transcendental from the point of view of the slime mold. The slime mold and people live in the same physical reality and are subject to the same laws of nature. When extrapolating that to the human population and how individuals act, the slime mold experiment does provide a simplified version of what transcendence is at a human level. The Bible is a pattern human pattern captured through the myths and that's why it is valuable."

""Moses, why did you take us out of Egypt just so we could die in the desert?"" is a complaint that comes up a lot. Since Moses is speaking to God and relaying the word of God directly to the Israelites, would blaming Moses not by extension be blaming God too? That may be a bit of a stretch because it depends on the assumption that God exists, (and hey, if you're an ex-slave who's been wandering the desert for 40 years with no end in sight then you might lose faith too), but my point is at the very least they're saying it's Moses' fault, not theirs.
Of course, you could argue that in their case they may have had reason to be upset. They didn't ask to be born slaves. Wouldn't you think Moses was being unjust if he doomed you to wander the desert for 40 years because you were born a slave? That doesn't sound fair, it would be more fair if you were born somewhere else, free, right? But what the hell is Moses supposed to do about that? Well maybe God could have done something to make life more fair, but I don't think that's the right way to look at the purpose of the story. Moses took them out of slavery and freed them from tyranny for a reason, and instead of complaining and being ungrateful, the Israelites should be able to realize that there needs to be a journey down into chaos before they can begin the journey upward, going back to that diagram you've shown a few times. They were God's chosen people, and that's a blessing.
So my point is that they blame Moses a bunch of times, when they should have blamed themselves for sinning, or being a bunch of whiners, or whatever else they were doing.

That's one theory,  at least from looking at the story from a psychological perspective. (Looking at it from a historical perspective is another matter entirely.)"

I would say THAT is the final and greatest sin that the story is warning us about.  Pure appetite, without humanization and empathy can and will result always in destruction.  Sex was their way of consuming human flesh.  Others enjoy murder.  In any case, the ultimate crime is believing in consumption as the highest goal and most desirable thing, at the cost of all else.  Rudeness or even being inhospitable isn't it.  Its the devaluation and corruption of all that is holy and good for the sake of appetite, i.e. no willingness to sacrifice or endure, no patience or compassion.

Ugxa8Vmq-sErrrRFQm14AaABAg,Joe 魚 Sakana,1508555556693,"Dr. Peterson, I have an important question in regards to this lecture. There is severe cognitive dissonance here.

How is circumcision, forced upon infants, a sacrifice, when it goes against everything you describe sacrifice to be?

You describe it as burning away the old you, by choice. A serious act that you _remember_. That obviously does not apply to infant circumcision.

This is a topic that gives me an enormous amount of pain and trauma, and I was hoping that, even though you refused to denounce the act of circumcision in modern times, your psychological interpretation could give me some peace. But you cannot even be consistent in your interpretation, and everything has been made worse by it.

It's something that shakes me to my very core. I find it difficult to trust anything or anyone because of it. My family, medical doctors, and now even you. 

I hope you consider the psychological significance of the pain it causes those who stare at this evil monstrosity for what it really is, instead of constantly making excuses for it the way most people do.

I don't expect you to do this, but I hope you consider denouncing it at some point. Or at the very least, answer my question.

Thank you.

EDIT: I finished watching the second half and it appears someone timidly asked the same question during the Q&A. Unfortunately, you did not answer it. ""Sometimes you have to make decisions for your child"" is not a sufficient answer. (And ""Abraham has no right to abdicate responsibility to his child"" is an outright slap in the face.) 

It still undermines almost every aspect of what you say makes symbolic sacrifice meaningful.

Besides the fact that you outright state that something taken from you is not a sacrifice...

Transformation. An infant has not lived long enough to transform from something.

Burning off the dead wood. Off of an infant?

Dramatic act that burns it into memory. An infant does not remember.

Someone circumcised does not know the weight of what they have given up, because they do not even remember what it was like to have it. If this goes on for several generations, then NO ONE will remember what they have given up.

All circumcision becomes then, is nothing more than a tribal marker. A tradition for tradition's sake.

I am sure now more than ever that there is nothing of value in this practice. It truly is a self-perpetuating act of great evil, and always has been. 

""Oh that's just how modern people see it."" 

No.

I have listened to you squeeze nuggets of golden wisdom out of all other parts of the bible, but this part still manages to be self-contradictory, illogical pile of shit. Just like all other pathetic apologetics I've heard for genital mutilation.

I'm so tired of this vile pathology of the mind and spirit. How hard is it for people to be morally and ethically consistent for once in their damn lives? People apologizing for circumcision are like saying ""up is down"" and ""black is white"". Why do I have to swallow this bullshit? It's literally driving me insane."

It wasn't until the Flood of Noah that the curse was lifted (Gen 8:21). God promised to never curse the ground again on account of Man. 

Cain brought a sacrifice from the ground.  He had to be very good at what he did to beat the curse. Maybe he was bitter about the reality of that world as it was in that day. Maybe it was a pride thing. Abel looked out at the flocks and realized that he was not much better than a sheep in need of a shepherd. He brought  a life and sacrificed it. Maybe a substitution for his own.

Ugw_bWdX9meu-3XakmB4AaABAg,Ry Rez,1508555561949,A lot of the insight in this particular lecture remind me of the books by a man named osho rajneesh. He teaches that you should take responsibility for everything that happens to you because whether it's your fault or not it still did happen to you and you have consequences based on your choices going forward in any situation. Which has been so damn helpful to me because it eliminates that blame game that lies somewhere between something happening and you actually doing something about it. It's very hard to take responsibility for all the things that happen to you but it is powerful as hell. This type of teaching was profound for me at 16 yrs old and remains powerful at 28 yrs old. It is painful to begin this journey of ultimate accountability but the practice gets easier and the insight u will get into yourself and others is invaluable.

UgxiuIBeLmWH7wQJ4QF4AaABAg,John Sinclair,1505963561979,I have always seen that in the tale also. It is far more to do with appalling rudeness to strangers then it it's to do with homosexuality.
UgyJKnH3mbkE16Tj0bZ4AaABAg,Patrick Thomas,1505963561984,"I have to think that Dr. Peterson is going out of his way not to piss off the Gay community here.  Because this constant re-emphasis that the story has nothing to do homosexuality I think is wishful thinking and not missing the physiological significance of sexual immorality running rampant in a culture leading to even worse sin, such as the other things that Dr. Peterson suggest like impulsive conduct.  

The story as far as I can see includes the idea of acts of homosexuality being part of the immorality within the society that has become fully perverse.  That homosexuality being an accepted part of the society is therefore significant.  Now it is only part of the whole of the problem of Sodom and Gomorrah.  The other parts of mistreating strangers and the conduct of the culture as a whole is the full reason that Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed.  

Much of the bible is making the case giving into your basic desires without regard to moral principle lead to self destruction.  If those bad characteristics become common place in a society than the society will self destruct.  Homosexuality as the bible views it is an example of giving into basic desires without regard to moral principle and that is why it is a sin.  

Now homosexuality is not the only form of perversion in this story or within the bible but to suggest it has nothing to do with the point of the story I can't see as being intellectual honest."

From what I can see the only way you can see this as an explicit condemnation of homosexuality in particular is if you're going into it under the presupposition that this story in specific is about homosexuality. I mean, as an analysis you have to do it from a semiotic perspective, if you do it from a religious perspective then you compromise the analysis of the text, unless you're explicitly doing it from a dogmatic perspective and are more religious than analytical. 

And as somewhat of a semiotician my secular analysis up to this point has been pretty similar, although I do have some more explicit critiques of incest and homosexuality, especially of homosexuality in the context of a blind, corrupt society that only degenerates and holds nothing sacred(including love).

DINOSAURIA, WE
by Charles Bukowski

Born like this
Into this
As the chalk faces smile
As Mrs. Death laughs
As the elevators break
As political landscapes dissolve
As the supermarket bag boy holds a college degree
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
As the sun is masked
We are
Born like this
Into this
Into these carefully mad wars
Into the sight of broken factory windows of emptiness
Into bars where people no longer speak to each other
Into fist fights that end as shootings and knifings
Born into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it’s cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charge so much it’s cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this
Walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Muted because of this
Castrated
Debauched
Disinherited
Because of this
Fooled by this
Used by this
Pissed on by this
Made crazy and sick by this
Made violent
Made inhuman
By this
The heart is blackened
The fingers reach for the throat
The gun
The knife
The bomb
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive god
The fingers reach for the bottle
The pill
The powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
We are born into a government 60 years in debt
That soon will be unable to even pay the interest on that debt
And the banks will burn
Money will be useless
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs
Land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shake the earth
Radiated robot men will stalk each other
The rich and the chosen will watch from space platforms
Dante’s Inferno will be made to look like a children’s playground
The sun will not be seen and it will always be night
Trees will die
All vegetation will die
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The sea will be poisoned
The lakes and rivers will vanish
Rain will be the new gold
The rotting bodies of men and animals will stink in the dark wind
The last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases
And the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition
The petering out of supplies
The natural effect of general decay
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that.
The sun still hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter.

UgwSumLI3BK5ZTAo21V4AaABAg,Toni Thatcher,1505963567433,"""Bible regards Sodom and Gomorrah being involved in the drug trade comes from the book of Deuteronomy in which we read:

31  For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. 32  For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: 33  Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
Deuteronomy. 32: 31-33 (emphasis mine)

The term; ‘their grapes are grapes of gall’ highlights the use of the word ‘gall’ which is translated from the Hebrew word ‘roshe’.  Roshe is the Hebrew word for the poppy plant, the source of opium and, according to the above quote from Deuteronomy, cultivated by Sodom and Gomorrah.

Roshe is also translated as poison in the same passage from Deuteronomy and is associated with the effects of snake venom.  The ‘water of gall [roshe]’ is also referred to in the Bible many times, eg. Jeremiah 9:15.  This is direct reference to the sap of the poppy which is very bitter to taste and creates a drunken effect when consumed.

Because it is an opiate, roshe could be used to deaden the effects of pain, both physical and mental – it is highly addictive.  It was this concoction that was offered to Jesus Christ on the cross as he hung dying.

They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall:  and when he had tasted [theroff], he would not drink.
Matthew 27: 34

Another word associated with roshe is ‘wormwood’, from the Hebrew word ‘lahanow’ which means to poison or curse.  There are references to ‘bitter as wormwood’ (Proverbs 5: 14) and ‘drunken with wormwood’ (Lamentations 3: 15) and it features as a famously dire moment in the apocalyptic writings of Revelation:

And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood: and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

The principle difference between men and women culturally biologically seems to be that becoming a woman is a passive process, initiated by nature, ie the start of the menstrual cycle, becoming pregnant, lactating and even the menopause are all things that just happen while in many cultured becoming man vs remaining a boy is chosen, you must for instance chose to be circumcised, kill a dangerous animal on your own , or in the west, succeed in a dominance hierarchy. This is a another reason males are singularly drawn to the lectures etc as they instinctively know that they must ""choose"" their path mor carefully and that the choice supersedes the choice of just career. It is a spiritual path much like Abraham 's journey."

   You seem to keep saying that humans are the only animal that prepares for the future when your explaining how we can sacrifice what we want now for what we'll need in the future. I know that squirrels bury nuts in the ground for the winter and I have read that ants have storage room things in their ant hills for food, are you overlooking these things or am I misunderstanding what your trying to convey?

I assume this kind of feedback is important to your work)

Thanks for making these videos as well, they've really helped to bring me back to a more normal mindset after several years of opiate addiction. Though I do think you should clarify further on some of your points, such as when you say in one of your lectures to ""grow the psychopath in your head"", as you don't really go into what this means in depth and it seems to be a fairly dangerous thing to leave that open to interpretation. To me, it seems like the only reason I understand what your trying to convey with that statement is because of the uncontrollable rage and resentment that grew in me over 4 years of opiate abuse that I had to learn to let go of in order to actually become a functioning member of society. I guess i just dont understand why you think thats a good thing, though I guess in canada with how damn nice you people are it might be something thats more beneficial than it is here in america."

When I cook, I sometimes think about how I would do it if I were cooking more at his level. How do I crack an egg without getting shell in the edible parts? How do I crack it keeping the yolk intact? I've been cooking for months now without any pre-mixed things and I'm gradually getting better.

That is good to see here in the ex-Soviet Zone where I live. As a  Jewish Rabbinical student it is also interesting to see how he creatively re-invents Jewish tradition. For instance he simply disregards the anti-sex-addict  Puritan  tradition  of Prophets who did claim that to see  a Good  Future vision you must restrain your sexual instincts. So in Jewish books the Sodomites are homosexuals. He also has a basic tenet about the Future being the main part of the process of humans producing good-feel hormones (dopamine) - and  he simply claims it is a Universal religious idea. He rarely mentions when speaking a lot about the Verb (Logos)  that it is basic in the Hebrew name for the Higher (eloha) to be named Yehaweh - to Be in future tense. (It is debated because the concrete wovels are lacking today so  we prefer the translation Eternal- but anyway that contains the future.)  Anyway I am grateful to him as an ex-Soviet-colonized person, and so I accept his decision of simply disregarding the 3000 old Jewish tradition (which he regards highly  for they being aware of their own responsibility in making mistakes) on these few instances. Obviously he is attacked by gay-liberators   so he better swallows this topic. He is also attacked by rightists probably of being too ""positive"" on Jews, so it is more comfortable not to mention that the Jews knew his message since 3000 years (or 4000 if we speak of Abraham)."

After my girlfriend broke up with me 1 and a half years ago ( we were together 3 years) i fell into what Peterson calls the ""unknown"". I questioned everything i stood for. Everything i believed to be a part of me (and her). There was almost no ideal i held up at that time that didnt get deeply challenged. Now, that may or may not have happened because of the way the whole breakup thing went down (she pulled shit for months afterwards) but still, the initiation of the sequence of streams of thought came after three to four weeks.

I just wanted to explain my point with my own experience, because i have seen and still see what the credo of ""not looking back"" compared with narcissism can do to people.

Yours is definitely an interesting perspective, that the entire story is a Metaphor, but I feel that since you are Christian, you are taking a very charitable or rose-tinted view of the Stories.

Even if it's all Metaphor (and I'm not so sure I entirely agree with that statement and also not everyone interprets it as Metaphor either), there are some very suspect and reprehensible actions/themes discussed in the Stories.

But, still enjoyable hearing an alternate PoV."
UgyQo5J_ZPHAm8KUw014AaABAg,blacktigerpaw1,1503285174409,"1:36: 53 - Here is where the Sodom discussion begins, and to be frank, I didn't expect this much apologism.

The excuse that Sodom and Gomorrah was a case of inhospitality, and not sexual immorality (specifically homosexuality) is a common one. Fact, it's so common, you'll find hundreds of videos, blogs, and arguments where people who otherwise didn't care a slick for the Bible now are experts and insist that there is no condemnation of homosexuality or homosexual acts whatsoever - as evidenced by the comments section. 

Whether or not it was uncivilized behaviour, what we have a is a group of men who desire to know two male strangers in a sexual way and demand it; basically, a gay orgy that shouldn't be interrupted because that is the norm. Hospitality or not, since Sodom and Gomorrah were wicked places and such uncivilized, degenerate behaviour was normal because there was no civilized society left. Lot offered his daughters because he thought they would 'tame' the crowd, perhaps; gay supporters have snidely insisted Lot was just giving his daughters up for gang-rape instead of the servants of God. Before, a prostitute was gang-raped and left to sob on the footsteps of someone else's house; she was raped by a crowd similar to the one who attacked Lot. 

Let's say it's true: it was about inhospitality. Why did only men come to visit? Where were the women? Why didn't they come to see the strangers? Where were their fists on the door? Why were these rapists - and gay rapists no less - the only ones punished? Since Sodom was full of vice, and inhospitality among them, why wasn't it destroyed earlier? 

The Hebrew language on homosexuality is among the harshest. It's considered one of the worst curses on man. If the Hebrews were just condemning the so-called 'vices' of the uber-tolerant gay pagans, then they rejected their practices because they saw what it did to those people, and how it corrupted them.

You mentioned what happens when people cling to 'dead' things, like the forest fire analogy, and it fits the condemnation of homosexuality in Scripture. Routinely, homosexuals are referred to as greedy, wicked, selfish, loud, demanding, with a hatred of their parents (especially the father). If Sodom and Gomorrah were 'dead' cities, with no morality or anything that said they were civilized, it clearly had more to do with inhospitality, and more to do with the qualms of the people inside them. Homosexuals cling to death - both with their actions and their deep struggles with themselves - and in so doing, 'poison' the people in those cities.

Do I sound homophobic? Because I noticed a lot of people using the gay apologist argument: that Christianity doesn't actually say anything about homosexuality, that Jesus never condemned it, and that it was just about pagans. Cookie-cutter arguments reminiscent of the 'That's not real socialism!' sheet. If true - if Christianity really does not say anything mean about homosexuality, like John Boswell argued, then why do homosexuals have such an innate hatred of Christianity? Why the need for LGBT tolerant churches, if those arguments were never made?

Both Scott Lively, Robert Oscar Lopez and James B. De Young have written extensively on the Sodom and Gomorrah stories as well as the 'Christianity says nothing about homosexuality' memes. It isn't what people want it to be - but based on the comments, it seems they've already drunk the apologist Kool-Aid. And forgotten the warnings of Randy Shilts."

Negative criticism is being avoided. Such moral decisions are no small blot of ink on a shirt. Of course Lot is reprehensible, but apparently does enough right that God doesn't eliminate him.

UgwovEcAn1eRTJ4dBDF4AaABAg,Philip Spires,1503285177329,"One problem I have with Peterson's interpretation of the Bible is that he often claims that what happens to someone is the righteous will of God or the choice they made is a good one. That's not true.

JBP said that Abram was rewarded for lying about his wife being his sister. It was not the will of God that Abram was rewarded for lying, it was the will of those men who gave Abram wealth to atone for their sin. There is no confirmation anywhere in the words of the text that confirm that God thought Abram should be rewarded for lying.

JBP does it again with Lot, offing his daughter. The lesson isn't that Lot had a righteous understanding of hospitality, but that willingness to go along with an evil culture and remove yourself from the divine principle will not only cost you but your family as well. Just as it Noah's faith saved his family, Lot's abandonment damned his family."

Impropriety involves sexual acts that stem from a desire to feed internal demons that consume someone. For instance, rage sex is to feed a desire for dominance. Some people actually can be nurtured into homosexuality out of resentment, and when that happens, every sexual act goes from a beautiful celebration of romance and love for your significant other to an act of hatred of others and a desire to control them.

It's annoying to hear a child talk about style!  But it's possibly more so is when young adults in art school do it.  During my first year in one, a (admittedly talented) student lost it when a teacher tried to critique his work and inform him of the futility of painting on a surface that would be eaten by his paint.  I thought, ""why is this guy wasting his money, a scholarship, and/or time in a school when he thinks he's too good for it?""  I'm sure he didn't come out much better.  However, I saw several photography students start out drawing like small children take advice from teachers very seriously, even taking on extra drawing assignments.  They ended up improving far more than the rest of us, even drawing almost as good as the rest of us.

Hospitality isn't just an idea, a kindness, it's a duty. It is the duty that formed the foundation of all human trade and diplomacy. In most ancient kingdoms, to take someone into your home, under your roof, to feed and shelter them for a night, was a oath. It was an oath none would forgive breaking. It isn't just that the gods won't forgive your breaking of this oath, they will hate you for breaking this oath. 
In essence, it would be a more forgivable misdeed to allow your family to be harmed than a guest, unless that guest was to try and harm your family. I suspect it is because protecting your family is an expectation, you don't get to brag about it as you are supposed to do it. With a guest, you chose to take on that responsibility."

Story-telling is one of the main instruments through which cultural and moral ideas are explored and communicated. Studying these ideas and stories, can be a useful tool to understand the human mind and experience. My problem is that Jordan Peterson portrays biblical stories as particularly important from a psychological and moral perspective, but he presents no real evidence why we that is a valid portrayal. From my perspective, you can study the Harry Potter books (or almost any novel) and find similar themes and ""pearls of wisdom"" in them. Think about this. The ideas he presents are in no way new or novel. They are old concepts that you can trace back to the psychoanalytic movement of the 19th and early 20th century (with particular emphasis on Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud). Jordan Peterson did not get these ideas from the bible. He finds that these stories reflect ideas he already hold and cherish. The bible is the most interpreted book in the world. Why are there so many and often mutually exclusive interpretations? Simply because the bible is more often used to confirm preexisting ideas than finding new truths or more wisdom. In that sense, Jordan Peterson isn't really different from a theologian or a priest. He is basically cherry-picking. As said, I don't object to using biblical stories as analogies or in order to explain psychological concepts. But, you should be honest about what you are doing."

UgzVkmXgJ_svnjoTz9R4AaABAg,Dracosophy,1503285196208,"First time I've disagreed with anything Dr. J.B. Peterson has done or said when he skipped over any comment on if circumcision was good to do, or not. If you do any balanced, unemotional research into it, It's obviously not. As someone who seems to be an individualist and trying to work for the betterment of humanity, I think JBP should at least weigh in on this practice which has little-to-no benefit, and a great many negatives to the body & mind.
I understand why he didn't; not wanting to become side-tracked and/or step on toes or whatever, 
but it really needs to be looked at realistically in the few countries that still allow it, and a public figure like JBP who is seen by many as a role-model and person of unimpeachable value making a more clear statement on the issue would go a long way towards reducing the harm this sort of practice causes.

No. No, no, no. That ""less chance of STD infection"" was invented so that places with high rates of HIV/AIDS infection, like South Africa, could get large amounts of IMF and other money donations. Money which has a huge tendency to vanish into the corrupt systems it is placed. 
It has NOTHING to do with being more healthy, and actually makes people less healthy mentally and physically. Please, everyone, do some research please before you give people misinformation about diet/health issues...
there is so much incorrect information that is even spread by doctors themselves these days (not all fats are bad, in fact most aren't, for example... canola oil goes rancid fast and is therefore extremely bad for you due to the free-radicals it steeps you in and the damage that causes. Other oils are far better options; sunflower, olive, coconut, BUTTER being the BEST choice. Butter is GOOD. the only that could possibly bad about butter is if the animal it was made from had an extremely poor diet and the ratio of fat types within the animal was therefore extremely off in the unhealthy direction)
I'll stop there for sake of everyones' poor eyes and staying on topic."

UgxeJIhUQE53DI0mtJp4AaABAg,bideo gaems,1503285196239,"Normally I'm pretty receptive to these lectures but I think it's disingenuous to claim that the passages in Leviticus aren't a condemnation of homosexuality. I don't see enough evidence to the contrary to accept that. I also see some people in the comments claiming that this is excusable because Jesus himself did not do anything to condemn homosexuals and he's the Messianic figure, but if that were criteria to judge a passage's validity all of the lectures up until now would have been invalid as well, being from the old testament and obviously not about Jesus. So I don't see any adequate criteria to justify discounting only Leviticus and don't see evidence to refuse the idea that it's a condemnation of homosexuality. 

But, given that the Bible is a book of moral doctrine I don't see why it isn't worth discussing why the Bible condemns homosexuality. It's obviously not arbitrary if only because of its continued presence in a tome this highly edited. Which would mean that the people and societies who created the stories that became the Bible observed consistent negative consequences of homosexuality. Considering that the Bible condemns sex before marriage and multiple other sexual practices, I don't see why the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality would be (in the era of it's creation) a practice of arbitrary hatred and not a practice of utility. Contraception and birth control are extremely recent inventions, and beyond that ancient peoples were obviously not especially sanitary. It seems entirely logical a condemnation of sex before marriage could have been in part a halt against conceiving children before two people were engaged in a binding way that ensured The welfare of the child, and anti-homosexuality a halt against the spread of disease (especially that a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis degrades people mentally, which could have been interpreted as divine retribution for the act itself). Unless of course there are immediate political advantages to anti-homosexuality that aren't immediately jumping out at me people would like to bring up. 

I also would be more interested in some more explanation on homosexuality from Peterson (or anyone for that matter) not from a biblical, more 
an anthropological perspective. In his psychology and maps of meaning lectures he discusses female hypergamy, and I'm interested in how samesex relationships form given that they'd be between either two individuals who both do the sexual selection attracted to status in the case of women, or between two individuals competing for status and are generally more visually oriented and attracted to bodies in the case of men. I don't think anyone can still make a case for homosexuality being morally wrong, but it's still worth examining for knowledge's sake alone. It's self evident that gay relationships aren't perfect mirrors of straight ones with the gender ratios merely changed around."

After all there has been a shift from considering offspring/kids as personal property to them being subjects having individual rights. Not very long ago the fathers decided about the career of their children, which probably hardly is the case in Western societies today. This does not confuse the fact that kids are not little adults when it comes to rights/capacity to make responsible decisions. It is cowardly and despicable of adults to shed their responsibility onto the shoulders of underage kids. However, what would be wrong about getting away from old habits after due consideration ? Isn’t this what responsible rejuvenation of culture is about ? Which is not the same as ridiculing/overthrowing what we do not understand.

The keys exist in a couple things, Cain speaks to God, directly and He speaks back- this is something that happens to people only who have a profoundly close relationship to God rarely and those who are major players in shaping Gods plan for man, like Prophets, so it should be understood Cain has a profound level of understanding and responsibility. Not just anyone can be made a son of perdition. It requires a profound rebellion against God to get there and most men are to ignorant to do this. 

Second, God commanded an unblemished lamb be used for the sacrifice, not a plate of fruits and vegetables which Cain offered. Cain was deliberately in open rebellion against God, he was rejecting Gods will from a position of power and responsibility, The lamb represented Christ who was to die for mans sins, sacrifice of animals ended when Christ was sacrificed- why?- because the final sacrifice was done, man used the sacrifice for all those years as a reminder that one day a savior would come and He did.

Those kinds of questions have bugged me for as long as I can remember! I've never done drugs, but have a lot of family and friends who have. 99% of the time it destroys their families and themselves, but they still do it. I think the 'high' that allows them to escape reality is very powerful of course, but the 'reality' they live in is in some way worse than the consequences of the drugs. In some instances we can understand that, for someone who's been terribly abused or something. But from what I've seen, the 'reality' of the lives of my family members that use drugs, isn't that bad. I've questioned my mother endlessly about her addiction, (thankfully she's been clean for several years now), and I think the part of her 'reality' growing up was insecurity in herself, like a sense of worthlessness? so I think she found she didn't care or worry about that when high, but other than that she had an 'ideal' childhood from what I understand. Sorry for rambling about that but its an obsession for me.      When I was in my late teens I developed anxiety and panic for a few years, during that time, I could not for the life of me understand how all my friends couldn't see how truly dangerous life is! How driving, traveling, camping, drinking, basically everything fun, is so likely to lead to an early death, that its not worth doing. Thankfully a family friend gave me some tapes to listen to and I did so religiously and essentially 'got over it'. But for all those years I felt I could so clearly and easily 'see, hear, smell, and touch' the immediately, life-threatening danger all around me (even though I couldn't necessarily identify it, I just knew it was close by) and my friends just went on with their lives! Its a very isolating way to live. Anyway,  this lecture brought those memories back and reminded how thankful I am that you can explain and treat these kinds of problems. The tapes I listened to used the same methods I think you would use in your office. Anyway, as always, thank you for a very interesting lecture."

Ugze0AhZdU8FRAY9sa14AaABAg,Kon Berner,1503285213798,"Here is the most essential thing to know about productive sacrifice: it isn't really sacrifice. It only appears to be sacrifice due to misconceptions. But letting go of misconception, while it may feel like sacrifice, nothing is given up of value. Only pride, insistence, pushiness, presumption, and fear are given up. If you are willing to fully see your own darkness, see the pain and waste of it, and act to move beyond it, this is the only sacrifice that is required."

Ugz-Cx99Y_dENPbexKp4AaABAg,Chronosextant,1503285213809,"Some thoughts I had on the homosexual criticism of the Bible: 

The ideal person is not a homosexual person. The ideal person must be a heterosexual because we cannot perpetuate the good if we don't even perpetuate the species. So in this strict sense the homosexual is deviating from the ideal and is in sin. Noah could not be perfect in his generations if he was without generations. Abraham could not be a father of nations if he was without descendants. So I think its valid to point to the sinfulness of homosexuality. However its not as though homosexuality is the worst sin, not by a long shot. It belongs to the category of things that could probably be changed for the better, but if that's the only thing you could improve about yourself then you're doing pretty damn well. You have to get your priorities straight if you're going to criticize people and get them to listen to you. 

The ideal is going to be a strong family environment with a mother and father and children. Somewhere below that ideal might be a strong family environment with two fathers or a single mother. Obviously being loved and guided by an ideal father and an ideal mother would be ideal, but there are a myriad of imperfect goods that stretch between the ideal and the antithesis of that ideal. The same book teaches us not to judge others more harshly than we would judge ourselves."

""After Holy Communion, I heard these words: You see what you are of yourself, but do not be frightened at this. If I were to reveal to you the whole misery that you are, you would die of terror. However, be aware of what you are. Because you are such misery, I have revealed to you the whole ocean of My mercy. I seek and desire souls like yours, but they are few. Your great trust forces Me to continuously grant you graces. You have great and incomprehensible rights over My Heart, for you are a daughter of complete trust. You would not have been able to bear the magnitude of the love which I have for you if I had revealed it to you fully here on earth. I often give you a glimpse of it, but know that this is only an exceptional grace from Me. My love and mercy knows no bounds."" (718)"

Even the more wise, well-read professors who valiantly believe they are seeking the defenins of absolute truth, even if they are sincere like Peter-son, they can be sincerely eternally wrong when they choose to ignore Jesus' direct command to not read something into the Scriptures that the Scriptures are not explicitly stating especially when it's called ""private translation"" which Jesus through Peter strictly forbid which is what Peter-son is doing, for when such is committed, it's because of vanity there is such an outright twisting and warping of the Scriptures in it's historical israelite linguistic spiritual sense by those Jesus never sent, and the ear tickling oratory of words of wisdom is as King Solomon declared, all is vanity, especially in glorious false teachings and preachings by certain westerners who ignore the how God (Jesus) Himself declares HOW to read HIS words PROPERLY from the redeemed mindset (Matthew 6:24-34, Mark 8:34-38 / Luke 9:23-24, 14:27, 17:33 / John 3:3-5, 3:16, 12:24-25 / Galatians 5:19-26 / 1Corinthians 1:30-31, 1Peter4:17-18 etc) ..  NOT their own worldview and non-authoritative view on the matter (according to Jesus Himself) only further demonstrates the mystery religion false wisdom;

Mat 12:36  But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 
Mat 12:37  For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. 

Jer 14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
Jer 14:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
Jer 14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.

Not all youtubers are brainwashed by westernized heavy thick mind control propaganda, called ""Public Education"".  Some of them can actually read the biblical greek and biblical hebrew in varying ability in the actual spiritual mindset Jesus commanded and weren't born speaking english which assists greatly in comprehending the proper societal contextual-culture views of such peoples.  +Jordan B Peterson, with all due honour, you only further confirm that your own views of the matter only are further causing more confusion since the Holy Bible is anti-philosophy (Colossians 2:8-9, one prme example) and Jesus already predicted you folks would do such to your own blindness while thinking you are doing God a favour _(John 16:2)_.  You're whole approach from the first step, starts in error... it's from your point of view, not the correct Scriptural point of view.. it's sad, men's worldly wisdom is foolishness to God;

1Co 2:12  Now we (the redeemed born again saints) have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 
1Co 2:13  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. (only possible for born again saints according to Jesus not me) 
1Co 2:14  But the natural man (the unsaved philosopher, sage, 'wise man' of this world, epicurean, sophist, mystic etc) receiveth NOT the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: NEITHER can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. (he's locked out of the spiritual understanding for now or forever) 
1Co 2:15  *But he that is spiritual (redeemed truly in Jesus the Christ, God Incarnate) judgeth ALL things (doing so w/o hypocrisy)_, yet he himself is judged of no _(natural) man. (for the natural man is already self-condemned by not believing on Jesus the Christ of the Jude 1:1-3/Galatians 1:7-10 Gospel)

Man must repent (truly radical change in their life from serving the self to serving God/Jesus in a willful loving Father-Son / Father-Daughter relationship) and believe on the real Jesus the Christ of the Jude 1:1-3 Gospel, for the Lord Jesus IS a LONGSUFFERING GOD but He is ALSO a JUST and HOLY GOD and Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of *ultimately the paragon height of heinous utterly abominable acts of sexual immorality with it's repugnancy, repulsivity for it is the ultimate rebellion against Jesus' (God's) deliberate created order of how He created them MALE and FEMALE (Book of Genesis, 1, 2..) 

Luk 10:16  He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. 

Your words have condemned you Jordan, may Jesus the true have mercy on you if He wills, for if you died today, you'd be in hell.  Be converted today, eternity is a mighty long time to be wrong. 

1Co 3:18  Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
1Co 3:19  For the wisdom of this world *is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. * 
1Co 3:20  And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise (falsely wise, a.k.a. foolish)_, that they are vain. _(they are spiritually blinded, can't see, sitting ducks for self-destruction, already self-condemned) 
1Co 3:21  Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 
1Co 3:22  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
1Co 3:23  And ye are the Christ's; and the Christ is God's."
UgxizowxNv0zLQ5lzaZ4AaABAg,Kon Berner,1503285226657,"""You are not happy when people around you, especially people you love, are not fulfilling their potential."" I think there are many problems with this statement. First, it shows pride, because you think that your idea of another's potential is the correct one over what they are in fact manifesting. Secondly, it implies that the state of others is normal to be linked to one's own happiness and this misses the point of sorting yourself out and inspiring others (potentially) by this means. Third, it attempts to confuse love with a pressure to change others, instead of accepting that they are where they are. Pressure to change is among the most certain things that is not and cannot be love.

This doesn't mean that one will not sometimes register sadness about another human's struggles, but this world is about struggle, and so implying surprise or some exceptional state in regards to this is a judgmental forcing thought that is counterproductive. A normal and healthy human will put up a counter-current to resist the pressure, and what you have is a chasm. A superior human will feel sad, yet empathetic, about your confusion. A lower human will either bow to the pressure and take a bottom position or counterattack in an attempt to gain the top."
