Ugxb9SPvZ-24f6S-sJF4AaABAg,Jarrod Stowe,1534734160694,"I'm a Christian Fundamentalist and I'll tell you why.

It's impossible that you can become ""good"" by your own efforts, and by your own intellect, no matter how much you try. 

That's because it's not a matter of trying, it's a matter of our nature. During the fall our nature inherently changed, and we don't have the power to change it back. You can understand everything about the Bible, and that still doesn't have the power to change your nature, and what the Bible says is good, what it says is actually true, too.

When we fell from God his offer was to bring us back into relationship with Him, but only He can accomplish that.

He accomplished that through Christs sacrifice, which pays the price for our fallen nature. Not only that, but when you believe that Christ is who He says He is, and that His death was a sufficient atonement, He changes your nature. 

Sin can still effect you in various ways, but your nature towards it changes as it's no longer a function of your work, which is what the 7th day of rest symbolizes. Overcoming sin is no longer a matter of effort, but confession, humility, and repentance, faith, and hope.

As you rely on Christ to work out your salvation, He provides the internal inspiration and drive, showing you your errors and working to renew your mind. 

This is what Christians mean when they say born again.

Christ says He is the Vine and we are the branches, without him all of our efforts, all of our deeds are considered as stained rags. It also gets rid of boasting as no man can say it was I who became righteous, because man in and of himself can never become truly righteous, not to the degree that God demands.

This can be frustrating in that we became imperfect, but He bridges this imperfection by making us perfect, but not without coming back to Him, which is how and why we were created in the first place, to be in perfect harmony and relationship with our loving creator."

UgxvuvEl1L_ZZIqKxAh4AaABAg,Edgar Perez,1534215760744,"The main idea found in the Bible is that there is nothing we can do to save ourselves. You give some practical advice to make our lives a little bit less miserable and a little bit more meaningful, for this I thank you. Some of the stories of the Bible can be read psychologically, and it is useful. But you will miss the point of many of them if you do not accept Jesus. Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians, ""And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."" We cannot be good without faith in Jesus. Not Jesus as a metaphor for our own physique, but the historical Jesus, son of God who came to die for our sins. The faith that you speak of is not faith, for Jesus is the author and consumer of faith. But the faith you speak of is calculative reason, ""what do I need to do and not do in order to increase my chances of being successful and/or avoid catastrophe"" - this is not really an act of faith. The writers of the Bible believed in God, not as a psychological reality, nor a material reality, but as something above and beyond everything we can imagine, and SEPARATE from ourselves. Likewise, the New Testament writers believed in the historical Jesus as the Savior of the world, and they took everything that Jesus said as literal and not psychological truth. So when it says, ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life"", it is not to be interpreted as psychological, or mythological, existential, metaphorical, or mystical truth, but as literal truth. If it is not accepted as literal truth, and believed with the heart as well as the mind, then, the Bible claims, ""the highest possible good"" cannot abide in you. Without belief in Jesus the Bible is a dead, closed document, and no matter how hard you try you will always miss the point. Jesus himself said it, ""You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me."" Again, thanks for inspiring us to improve ourselves and the world, but I encourage you from the heart to give Jesus a chance."

If you take  every same archytype from the garden of eden, cain and able and min 19:26 the metaphor of the broken city,  and you look at it from the POV of only of the individual you alzo get the same profound moral lezzon, but specifically adopted to only the individual without society.  Dr. Peterson breifly touched on thiz.
  For example uzeing the example of the broken town/city, min 19:26.   Now the metaphor iz the city/town iz the reprezentation of your body,  and the people of the town are your different personalitiez, you when you're hungry, you mad, sad sleepy, confuzed, happy, psychotic and so on.   In the example of adam and eve there we see the garden of eden az the reprezentation of our body and adam and eve the animuz.

Simba, because of his lack of consciousness and the deceit and betrayal from Scar, was woefully unprepared for the flood (stampede) and its the very instant that his life and kingdom falls into chaos which he is not prepared to deal with. I just thought it was a a great picture of the negative results of not being conscious and not being prepared for the flood in your life that, like you said, is inevitable."

I don't blame them, it's how they were taught as children and they're dissuaded from thinking about it in any other way other than mostly literal. My Mom is an example and she's not stupid, she's also a super kind person, but she was taught to take it literally and I think I have shaken that literal interpretation a little bit, but after 50 years of believing and investing in something like that, you're not just gonna shake it off. On top of that, it's taught along with language and as if it's universal and in some way an equivalent to language and speech. That's another reason it's so hard to interpret it for what it really is, a psychological mythology. I knew something was up with the stories when I was about 12. Adam and Eve just didn't make sense taken literally. I asked a leader of youth group a few years later and he basically dismissed the question and acted like it was invalid in some way. That's when I really knew he didn't know what he claimed to know and that it was mostly bullshit in the traditional/literal sense."

The guy starts off under the same pretences of many who sought to destroy Christianity by taking out it's foundation as mere myth. This man however, builds a case for scripture based on rationality alone. It's truly beautiful. He grasps deeper concepts from his perspective than most modern theologians and delivers a truly important message. A great teacher of mine used to say, ""those who are too heavenly minded are of no earthly good."" 

Peterson adresses the relevance of the scripture in the here and now, as it should be. My only complaint is laughable; that he uses the King James version of the sermon of the mount which is more poetic but harder to understand. Get an ESV or at the very least an NIV, lol. You wont have to define a ""beam"" of wood and will be better understood when saying things like ""let the troubles of today be enough for today."" You might as well translate the direct aramaic/greek for us.  Then again I think Peterson is a bit of a romantic no matter how hard he claims to be arguing from a rational point of view.

I won't put myself down as much as I used to, i'll just see my shortcomings as aspects of my being that need to be worked on.

UgwjZradaaiv78YTMmR4AaABAg,lauradana22,1524279773831,"I don't get the hype around this guy , but it's come to that point where he is everywhere I turn my eye and ear to, so here we go down the rabbit hole:

This idea of the possibility of a unifying theory of everything (thus, the absolutely crazy abundance of topics in his discourse) was dropped in philosophy after the end of the modernism (which ended, not so coincidentally with Nietzsche), and it was dropped for very good reasons! There are no fundamentals that can be found or thought of to support any kind of a meta-narrative that can incorporate and explain the nature of reality, because we don't work that way. We just don't. It's been tried for 2000 years.  We've failed! Sure, such an idea that things cannot be explained in a clean, coherent and truthful manner (in the sense that it is true in every instance of that particular thing that the truth refers to)  is bothersome, because it explodes, as this dude observes any notion of categort, of rationality, of principle, of general, of whatever you can use to explain any other shit as a consequence (like myths, religion, science, etc.).   

Since, admitting defeat is usually not the case with nutters like philosophers, some solutions to recuperate these notions have been indeed found. What post-modernism brings forth is this idea that you do not need find something that sits outside human nature to explain human nature, you just need to understand from your limited human perspective how things work for you in a manner that can be then applicable to any other individual. So, what they tried to do was to find some constants (invariants) in humanity, which is what I think Peterson tries to do in his mind, but fails miserably.  

Now, in order to launch yourself in this search, you must first understand how the production of reality works. You have some experiences that are interpreted through, what one might call, your encounter with culture (i.e. your mom telling you that boys don't cry, or that science is a superior form of knowledge than sociology because it is more sound or whatever BS like that, or the use of the word 'dream', or anything you have came into contact socially and culturally through language). 

Obviously, both your perception and this bundle of social and cultural context are subject to failure. So, the nature of the exercise is to try to free your perception as much as you can off this personal and historical interpretative mechanism that you were traditionally raised and live in. Whatever your are left with is supposedly a constant in human nature. Like for example, whatever you do, you do to achieve something else. Or, that you are usually building tools for other tools, or that you assume most of what you think you perceive; like i.e the back of your laptop, that you don't actually see - no you don't, don't kid yourself. After you've done this, you can then begin the construction of new mechanisms to explain social interactions in such a way that these new mechanisms ARE CLOSER to those constants in humanity. 

Yes, the way to do this is by producing AUTHENTIC INDIVIDUALS, but authentic individuals have a real concern about their own nature, not just look to justify some bullshit in their belief systems or clean their rooms while listening to this. But then again, most of you and the population of this planet are idiotic little kids with no where to turn but a strong father on the internet. He is right about that and I do think he should earn his money from it. There's too much not to tap in not to do it, if one can do it.  

Do some cleaning in your mind and then you can watch Peterson and I will congratulate you! What stands and what doesn't is the first step. You don't need more Peterson to guide you, you just need some honesty and clear thinking. A hard attitude to adopt, if not impossible to practice in a consistent manner.

You say the curse happened because Ham discovered a kind of weakness of the father, or somesuch. Its simlified, but anyway: My suggestion would rather be to accept the shame of his fathers nackedness for what it is: Shame. The ""Sin"" then would have been to experience shame for a situation, that need not naturally be shameful; after all, what in itself is shameful obout nackedness, especially if there is love between a father and his son? Especially a father who just saved us from a flood?
Assossiate the shame for nackedness with the story of the fall in Genesis, where Adam and Eve covered their nackedness out of shame for what they had done. Especially if we take the Fall to be related to the sexual parts (surely the fruit is a symbol!). That would suggest, that the shame of the fall had somehow survived the flood, and relates again to the sin of Adam and Eve. To my understanding this would be a better explanation of the Noahs Nackedness and Hams curse Story. Anyway, thanks alot for a great series. Be well, Rudi from Germany"

That's why you either trust the book, that it came from God, and that the word of God interprets itself, and therefore leave YOUR interpretations out of it, or you'll become your own God, and good luck trying to save yourself.

There are real giant skeletons, they've been dug up for thousands of years, and are still being discovered from 7 to 16 feet and some taller. Laugh at the risk of being ignorant based on your refusal to seek out the real evidence.

It all starts in Genesis 3 after the fall, when God curses man, the earth and the serpent, all for their own specific sins.

God foretold about a ""seed war"" where the ""seed of man"" humans, and the ""seed of satan"" fallen angels impregnating ""the daughter's of men"" and producing a very real forbidden race of giants.

Josephus describes the Greek ""Gods' - fallen angels and their hybrid offspring - seed of satan the Demi Gods half man half fallen angel. The fallen angels rebelled and caused man to worship them as 'Gods""

He refers to a real set of giant bones which were on public display in Jerusalem at the time of his writing the Antiquities of the Jews.

There are elongated skulls being studied and there are real scientific tests results which are absolutely startling 
and prove beyond all scientific proof, a LOT of these elongated skulls are NOT the result of cradle boarding, but rather the real hybrid race of giants, which people who worshipped them as Gods and demi Gods, emulated.

Why did people start binding their baby's heads"" Same with long necks of Africa etc.
These things are real, there is an effort to cover this up by the neo Darwinian atheists scientists, and in spite of their worst efforts, the science IS coming out and they'll either succumb to the facts, or be left behind.

Folks, the evidence is at your finger tips, there is NO excuse for ignorance based on YOUR personal paradigm, no to have a damned look to see if these things are true, because I've looked, and I know they are real.

There's literally nothing wrong about this. They used a strong spokeswoman to convey the message of this 1 minute video:

""The only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies [of the media, education, hollywood, marches] with a clenched fist of truth.""

I'm not sure how much attention JP gave to the attempts to usurp Trump: the paid-for protests, the rise of Antifa, the funding & direction of it, the anti-free speech, the violence, and the build up of Nov 4th which ultimately collapsed because the funding didn't come through (Saudi Prince roundup 11/3).

If our nation was taken by our brothers and sisters misguided by the absolute force of deception, the only way we as a nation could have defended it would have been to arm yourself. Luckily, the 2nd Amendment in America (which the left continuously attacks to revoke/strip it, even by false flags) is exactly what protects Americans from its own government. This is why Obama is satirically referred to as the greatest NRA salesman of all-time.

JP may not understand the fullest lengths of American politics. He's on the right side of history with the fight against the left's general political stature like censorship and forced speech but he's lacking real-time observation to accurately construct the magnitude of the enemy's force. Again, this is fine because the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Just watch Season 2 Episode 3 ""Auto Erotic Assimilation"". Rick loses the thing he loves (complete acceptance, or being loved) because of his own neglect, and attempts suicide. That's how the show finishes. It's so obviously the complete opposite of nihilism. Here is a man who is constantly striving to get things to work out, not only for himself, but even as he denies it, manifestly for others as well (example citadel of Ricks). He is the hero. He is the embodiment of human struggle. I'm going to have to go further here and say that the person who thinks this show is nihilistic is an idiot.

Now I'm going out on a limb, in the sense of this being an unpopular statement, but I believe it in earnest, that anyone who claims to be from a middle eastern background almost always cannot comprehend the complexity of western civilisation. Even natives to the civilisation can struggle. People outside of it are at a loss to understand it almost completely and any of it's manifestations will be almost always badly interpreted.

One final note, anyone who suggests that somehow Jews lie outside of the realm of western civilisation is an utter imbecile. One example: without the Jew, Bach would not be famous. Why? Because he was buried in an unremarkable grave and all his music manuscripts were dumped in an uncategorised pile of useless old historic remnant. 

A jewish publisher found them, cleaned them up, organised them and made copies available to the public for sale (yes omg a commercial interest, how appalling yfl) and the originals freely available to musical researchers. The rest is canonical western civilisation cultural triumph. 

Btw, the guy was sent to a concentration camp never to return. This information is at the Bach Museum in Leipzig across from St. Thomas Church (Thomaskirche)."

Islamofascists vs nihilism, Islam has been expanding since it's very beginnings and the principal concept of turning all the world into an Islamic state led by theocratic government has never been canceled. Muslims were defeated in 1918 and we are 100 years later now. The advance of Islam in Africa, Asia and Europe are very great in last 50 years, without any military hostility. Ideology of theocratic dictatorship is as strong and stable as it has ever been, thanks to strict adherence to the dogma and enforcement of the law that precludes the idea of any dissidence for ages. The genetic built of old-time Muslems has adopted to this structure of society and changing it from within is unlikely. This type of people in a great majority is very hostile to the idea of freedom of thought, as in their historical experience this meant violence and brutality. Nihilism is certainly not suitable for them either, as it is poisonous for anybody...I guess the only solution for the West is to stop immigration from Muslim countries,  or, even better, stop immigration from anywhere except for very rare and special cases. After 20-30 years of this restrictions the policies can be revised based on the needs of a specific country. Mind you that Muslims leaving their current places of residence are generally a more intellectual and active portion of the population in those countries, so stimulating this brain drain  would result in further degradation of the average IQ of the population with resulting establishing of the most brutal dictatorships in those countries, and certainly long and bloody wars, civil and between neighboring states."

Ugj09U3WonCcBHgCoAEC,Nikita Nechayev,1503284611522,"2:10:38 As someone who lives in Russia and understands its political situation quite well, I must tell that Russia doesn't return to Orthodox Christianity and it is indeed mere collusion between a corrupt church and a corrupt state. Our elites were taught by Soviet schools that religion is merely an instrument of manipulation of masses, so when the Soviet system collapsed our politicians from CPSU suddenly became religious. All top politicians in Russia, including Putin, are (former) CPSU members. There is huge propagandistic push now for traditionalism and Orthodoxy and all that, but it's all hypocrisy, because our current political regime is essentially kleptocracy. Most people in the country identify themselves as Orthodox Christians by now, but at the same time less than 5% of population ever read the Bible and there is a lot of immorality and crime here. Just look at homicide or abortion statistics for instance.
But having said all that, I should also notice that the younger generation is much better and moral than the older ones, those who were born in the USSR. They, young people, usually don't consider themselves religious but they basically act as if they believe in God, they have moral principles. Not all of them, but a large portion of them for sure. And overall situation with crime gets better every year. I'm not afraid of getting my stuff stolen while sleeping in a train as my parents and grandparents were at their time. And I believe it is the case not because the government's efforts, but despite the government's efforts."

I'm a bit of a misanthrope myself who spends a lot of time in my ""head space"" and interacting with people for long periods of time gets exhausting fairly quickly. 

Glad to hear Peterson's response though. Just because someone may prefer talking about abstract ideas/concepts, while the majority of the ""normies"" (ie usually well-adjusted people unlike ""intellectuals"") prefer more concrete topics, that doesn't make the intellectual the better person by default. Wisdom is not intellect. Knowledge is not morality. 

It's taken me a while to learn how to navigate interactions in which I'm not interested in the surface conversation but the solution I've come to to cope is just ask questions! People love talking about themselves and will share more than they realize about if you're good at asking questions in an open and innocuous way. Basically you have to get over your conceit and work harder at listening to people because you do not hold the copyright on wisdom and everyone can teach you something (even if only as an example as what not to do)."

UgjrgNSNIU1LEHgCoAEC,Troublechutor,1503284634555,"What I've taken away from JP's perspective on these subjects so far is that the seems to feel that the human ego is so very fragile and chaotic that its in constant danger of self delusion and implosion... like we're all traversing a rope bridge over a pit of fire and carrying a dixi-cup of gasoline on our heads. 

I think this is very much the parallel of what a police officer must experience with regard to how they perceive the world once all the polite veneer of civilization is stripped away... they start to see everyone as suspect and every interaction as some angle being played toward a goal of dominance or advantage.  JP just deals with fragile people so much that the spectrum of potential successes and failures leave everyone in a very fail-heavy set of options, with so very few success outcomes as to easily justify the notion of the narrow path (as per Jesus) as a built in reality to the human experience."

And maybe that is what Peterson needs more thinking about.  Perhaps he won't be so defensive or put off by such natural questions.  I say, for the sake of consistency, if you can represent chaos as a dragon, you can represent some otherworldly power as the gods.  But everything near and dear to Peterson -- existentialism, biology, Darwinism, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Freud -- would balk at the idea of God.  So that mountain needs climbing at some point..."
