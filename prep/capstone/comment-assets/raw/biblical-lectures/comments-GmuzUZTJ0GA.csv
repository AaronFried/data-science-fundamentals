Previously my folks had spent a fortune on psychologist and psycho therapy in my youth, I myself spent untold paychecks on pot and booze, pills and anything I could snort to help me feel like I was in control. Wasn't until I read 12 rules that I realized i was the Peter Pan among my friends whom all were married and building their futures. 

Now I'm off the island and taking responsibility. Thank you good doctor. One day I'll thank you in person."

UgwrAofNCuHtzKHsw514AaABAg,AGMI Church,1532401442101,"Prof. Peterson. You made several references to God backing off as humanity emerged. At the same time, there is a continuity of the storyline.  You seem to be unsure as to why that looks that way. The Old Testament is a story about Israel and how through Israel God was going to reach the world. The reason it seems that God backs up is that Israel had so broke covenant the story focus on Israel going into exile due to their idolatry. God was unable to dwell with them because they we horrible covenant partners. The story speaks of their journey moving away from God. The significance with this distinction is this,  as we become more human as God intended the more interaction, communication, and noticeable relationship with God  we are to experience, not less of God. We are created as sons of God."

Ugwu5mMLi1VSRhaY6lF4AaABAg,BigMikey76,1532401442116,"I've always seen the progression of the Bible, regarding the early presence of God and his gradual drawing back, as a model for parenthood. A good parent bows out gracefully and gradually to allow the child to become self sufficient, but still guided by what was taught throughout the process. 
The nature of the stories also follows a pattern of child development. The early stories are, on one level, simpler. It begins with prohibitions, and the punishments are quite straight forward and easy to understand. The flood, for example, is directly causal and impossible to ignore, like a spanking. Later, the punishments, most obviously the exiles, take a more extended form, and encourage contemplation on the part of the punished people, which mirrors the concept of grounding. The new testament sets the stage for mankind's adulthood - the rules are set, the lessons taught, and now we are responsible for managing ourselves."

Someone is speaking to us from just outside this dimension, even the One knocking at the door of our souls and calling to us to open the door to Him all through our lives. 

And now we have Dr. Peterson opening up this conversation so very wonderfully. He is shining a light in the encroaching darkness now so evident in what was once Western Christendom. 

Here is a video on the key issue of the Old Testament, that of Israel and our seemingly forever broken relationship between the royal Jewish house of Judah and its emphasis on God’s righteous rule and Law and the mysterious “Church” with its Gospel of mercy and Grace now gone so far off into lawlessness. So what happened to cause the law/ grace fracture line, the blood-feud that broke Israel into two kingdoms after the death of Solomon. And what is the plan of the God of Israel to wrap up the story, to redeem a people, for Himself, a chosen people from both houses of Israel and from every nation race and tribe?

Ugw7IvQyrjjnhQSpPI94AaABAg,Thomas Hamang,1519182274644,"I have sort of a draft of an idea that could work. Or maybe its more of a question..

Sosialism and capitalism is both working “good enough”, right?, even if they do both kill alot of life in many cases. But how about if we mix them based on individual age through a life-span.


sosialize everything 100% from birth (free health care for all kids, state owned and democracy ruled youtube schools with jordans schooling/parenting program, and a free around the world study trip, that lasts for 5 years or so, so you can move away from parents/family, and friends, so that you get some perspektive on cultures and their ying and yang, the enviroments treasures and dangers, all the animals and insects hard work and misbehaving, and everything worth sorting yourself out for, you get to meet people from all over the world, getting you prepped for marriage, for builing a house, for doing work the next 40 years, all of it, until you are 30. Then you have the tools to implement this kind of lifestyle also, maybe.

but then, after that, its hardcore 100% capitalism from lets say 30. Everybody has gotten a fairER chance, regardsless of how you define fair, maybe?

And when people get 65 or even 70 lets say, since everybody had a long cool around the world trip in their 20s, its no problem holding out for a bit probably. then we hit sosialism again so health care and pension is paid by everyone, not because we have to, but because we care about our human race, all life on earth, and all future life. That means we have to systematize our resources and usage of them better. I mean, this lifestyle is not going to hold up. Seriously. Well maybe, but more can come after us, if we all aim at it more like this, in my line of thought.

That also adds up great to the fact that “those who have weapons and know ho..” 

Just because we can fight each other for the last dollar, doesn’t mean we have to."

 ""The type of capitalism that leads to (too big to fail)"" there is no type of capitalism that leads to (too big to fail). Government controlling money printing, interest rates, inflation and making government programs that effect the market, The USA does NOT have a free market under this amount of government control. This is the classic big gov/socialist trick of create a problem then blame it on a free market that doesn't even truly exist to get more control then impose that tyrannical control over the market and freedom. 

The 2008 collapse was 100% the govs fault because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which caused a mortgage security meltdown and what happened in the aftermath??? they blamed the free market then calmed they could fix the problem that they created in the first place by balling out banks sound familiar??? 

RULE 1 in understanding a big government country if they say they are gonna fix a problem they created it.

RULE 2 whatever the name of the program assume it will have the opposite effect of the name in the outcome.

UgxXc-QQlPmraULD5i94AaABAg,CJPW Design,1519182280251,"Hi Jordan, to answer your query regarding the turtledove and the young pigeon, the reasoning is as follows:
the passage speaks of God's covenant (cut/sacrifice) with Abraham. The animals are 3 years old to signify the 3 covenants to come : Abrahamic covenant of faith, Moses covenant of Law and Jesus Christ's covenant of Grace. 
The 3 year old heifer is symbolic of God's covenant of obedience through faith and forshadows the Law as the ashes of a red (blood) heifer in the book of Numbers (v. 19)
The 3 year old goat symbolic of the Law forshadows the removal of the goats from the sheep (sons of the Ram/Lamb of God) in the final covenant (see Matthew v.25)
The Ram symbolic of the Grace of God and the Lamb of Revelations.
Finally the turtle dove and pigeon are birds to represent the transition/progression to the third covenant as it moves into the third day. The Ram is the fullness of the Holy Spirit made flesh and represented by the turtle dove which becomes the pigeon to carry the Gospel (Good News in Koine Greek)  to all the World.
Thus the third day of the third covenant the five fold ministry will be raised up under the power of the covenant of promise (see Ephesians v.4) - the final covenant of the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God to be a perfect man in the stature of the fullness of Christ.
Thus the 5 symbols (heifer, goat, ram, turtle dove and pigeon) represent the five fold ministry.
as an aside - the fowls/vultures came down upon the carcasses is representative of Evil/Satan seeking to steal the Revelations of  God as these always unlock the mysteries of God and release the power within ourselves at the end of the age of darkness."

A by-blow of that goal is to train students in the methods of knowledge production for the continuance of that activity, but it is a by-blow only.

UgywX-gX2OK5tKFD4Bp4AaABAg,Gøran Greggor,1516503880393,"I disagree. Those people WERE in fact that primitive. What Sam Harris told Peterson in their second discussion is exactly right. This way in which Peterson interprets the Old Testament, can quite literally be applied to any book, even a random cookbook. 
Which isn't to say that there is no wisdom in the Bible at all. The ancients weren't dumb. But they were ignorant and they were primitive. They were no scientists, but they were no psychologists either. So Peterson's parallel between sacrificing people and animals and saying that we all need to sacrifice something to achieve our goals, is so ubelievably weak. And that was perfectly apparent even to the people who wrote the New Testament, where the idea of sacrifice was transformed into SELF-SACRIFICE! That was almost 2000 years ago, yet the essence of the difference between the Old and New Testaments doesn't seem apparent to Jordan Peterson in the 21st. century. He also has no understanding of the historical contex whatsoever and completely skips over all the contradictions in the Bible, which if hyperlinked like that graphic he showed in his first lecture, would make an even richer image. Not to mention that his repetitive Jungian crap is getting seriously tidious. 
I gave it my best and got to the minute 45 of his 9th 2,5 hour lecture. But this is it. In the past 20 hours of listening to this so-called genius, I literally haven't heard a single original idea. This is nothing that you won't hear from an average Catholic, because they actually understand the metaphors. Couple that with Peterson's regurgitation of Jung's mysticism and that is basically all. With everything after his first two lectures being just an endless repetition of the same psycho babble. It's like one of those self-help symposiums, only on repeat. The only people who, I guess, can in fact get something out of this, are; fundamentalist Christians and hardcore Atheists, who have absolutely no idea about religion."

When I first saw a short clip containing this part of the lecture, I had to replay it several times because I wasn't sure why Dr. Peterson got emotional. Then, when I think I finally understood, something clicked and I broke down.

I THINK I understand why you do what you do, Dr. Peterson. You have a sincere, fundamental, almost archaic love and concern for the well-being of fellow man that, frankly, I didn't even know was possible for a single person to have. I thought about the lecture in which you described what you designated the meaning of your life as, and how every morning, you think to yourself, ""I have 50,000,000 people to educate!""

And yes, you're definitely educating millions of people, but most of us know that you're doing more than that: you're changing lives for the better. And as a 24-year-old male in the 97th percentile for neuroticism, I can't adequately thank you enough for just the positive impact you've had on me, let alone the God-knows-how-many other people whose lives you've touched.

I'm so far from where I know I can be, but that's okay. You've pointed me in the right direction. I'm not even at the point where I can clean my damn room. I need to start even smaller than that. But that's okay too, because at least I have a more refined idea of where to start sorting myself out.

And that means NOT to think about what you want to really do. Having a stable job, where you spend the most of your energy on things that only semi-interest you is the name of the game. If Dr Peterson really wants to reach out to people below the elite he has to break the bonds of nine-to-five.

The holy spirit is the ability to recognize why its important to utilize the principles of both. 

After all, if you never have a foundation, or you abandon it, you either cant progress at all, or you abandoning the foundation will lead to the society's malformation and collapse.

A pharaoh whose household was just stricken with malady would seem much less likely to act against the man for whom God (or a god, as it may have looked from the pharaoh's perspective) intervened than the man he doesn't know, new to town, with a staggeringly beautiful wife. 
To put it another way, maybe he hid his cards and played modestly because he knew his partner (God) held a hand full of trump cards. 
The benefit to this explanation is that it makes Abrams decision one- at least in part- of faith and not so much one of cowardice."

Abraham has proof that this almighty god exists. He has no choice but to do as he bids, because what else can he do?
He is told of his future, of all the improbably forseeable events, and outcomes to his actions.
He is promised prosperity* after suffering. He can decide, if the gain is worth the suffering, and in this story, to him for whatever reason, it always is. Even other people suffering due to his decissions is ok to him.
None of that happens in real life. You don't know the future. You don't know the outcome. You can suffer indefinitely.
Abraham doesn't care wether god has good reasons to his actions, he just acts as if, and in this story of course he has.

*Procreation seems to be the ultimate reward, that is worth all suffering. Wether it is the deed or the aftermath, I simply can't accept that mindset.

They do not account for this, and they account heavily for sins. It is all they see. And in this way, by this lack of accounting, Liberals are giving away all the precious blessings of this country.

For instance, Helen of Troy, Daji (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji), Yang Guifei (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Guifei) etc. And interestingly these beauties who can ""make cities fall"" also inspire great works of literature. Perhaps by claiming Sarah his sister instead of his wife, Abraham ""unpossessed/unowned"" her, hence avoided ""catastrophe""? ....Just a thought."

UgyNgto4vKmfoFP4RP94AaABAg,Randall Calhoun,1505963104503,"I like the archery analogy with regard to ""sin"". it works on every level. As Dr peterson states it is to miss the bulls eye or target. Peterson says that one can miss in several ways. 1. you dont bother to shoot at all. 2. you close your eyes (ignore the fact that youre shooting). 3. to aim in the wrong direction or at the wrong target.

beyond the miss shots and aims the idea that came to me is that in archery or in life choices once you shoot- if you mean to or not, or aim first or not - there is a whole other dimension as the arrow travels. 1. you cannot take the shot back once its made. 2. you cannot predict precisely where it will land even with expert aim (you could accidentally shoot someone for example....maybe they walk into your shot or maybe it just goes wrong) and 3 you must live with the result no matter where your shot lands.

therefore the metaphor works well as it encompasses all aspects of cause and effect of the choices one makes (or doesnt make but happen anyway)"

UgziYEtOEzdEhYlxeRh4AaABAg,IntrospectiveLazyMan,1503284711354,"Internal discusion im having in my head: Prof. Peterson has mentioned that in nowadays people like to have their god domesticated. I really like that way of putting it. In the past lectures I´ve come to give validity to the idea of the vengeful god, as a baton not of self-flajulation but of self-examination. The concepts of ""what have I done to deserve the wrath of god"", to ""be casted into the underworld"". This worked very well when god was everywhere. Even when the most simple interpretation makes god look like a selfish tyrannt, Peterson´s lectures have confronted my views with other layers of meaning as man confronts his own inadecuacies. Best example of this is the story of Cain and Abel. But now man takes the spotlight and god adopts the cast of Abraham as his stock and blesses those that bless them and curses those that curse them. And I must stop and wander. I can imagine the idea of god helping those that help and hindering those that hinder others and themselves and see it as an overall good concept. Providence comes to those that grow and make others grow with them and gives you the motivation to turn your back on those that only consume, and not take justice in your own hands, but I cannot imagine the mortal man of 4000 years ago preaching that kind of message to the tribe. The dragon can be within you or be the fellow human beside you and a message of seeking your best self can become seeking the worst in others. And Prof. Peterson no longer comments that second story, and it has me thinking. This man has studied the worst that mankind has to offer and encourages people on identifiying that kind of malevolence on themselves, and even dedicated a good amount of the earlier lectures to point that out. It cannot be denied that in the past both interpretations would be valuable, but I belive that Prof. Peterson is now trying to offer the most ""domesticated"" one, the path inward. The political climate today appears to hinge mostly on the path outward. To see sin on thy brother and denounce it immediatly based on your set of values. If people in the west act out the set of values inplicit on the christian religion as Peterson has said before... does that mean that seeing the dragon on your political enemy is also a concecuense of this? This is too much and I may lack the training to see the true weight of these interpretations in comparison with one another... also this whole text is already a mess... I´ll try to sort myself out before the next time I decide to comment."

I fell asleep with that lecture series playing in my headphones and I dreamed I was attending some kind of seminar event where Jordan Peterson was invited. Even after his lecture was over, people would keep following him around the premises like disciples and he just wouldn't stop lecturing out loud about the meaning of life and chaos. Even after people started getting tired and going back home, he would just keep delivering a non-stop inexhaustible stream of pure brain power sprinkled with pep talk and biblical references, through the night, through the streets, in the middle of some kind of spiritual gathering then some kind of political meeting about the future of education. A weird public curiosity with all sorts of people stopping by to understand what the heck was going on. He would keep delivering his lecture while interacting with random people and I would just stick around continuously like a parasite to make sure not to miss a single word. At some point people started freaking out when he predicted an eminent apocalypse. Pretty surreal."

I've heard it before, but having in mind the idea of metaphorical death (rather than literally giving of my whole life) I was able to generalize it to my whole life. 

And it made me think, what HAVE I sacrificed my life for, as a template for what I might sacrifice my life for in the future. Well I have sacrificed a career as a therapist for a joke in a college class. Yes I did. I had an assignment I thought was pandering (we had to do a write up on how to reach an oppressed group) and so I chose Mailmen (hey they are oppressed, right?) 

Needless to say my course professor was not pleased, and my maturity and dedication was questioned. I owned up to the fact that I was just drifting and not really interested in ""counseling"" as a career.

But I was willing to sacrifice my life as a therapist for comedy. I think I know what I am willing to sacrifice my life for now!! :) (and yes if I had to do it all over, KNOWING that I would be drummed out of the graduate program at UNK, I would TOTALLY do it all over again, totally worth the sacrifice of a life!)"

UgyRauQ5GArv3usa9NZ4AaABAg,jbilloud,1503284717230,"Hi Dr: Peterson;

I was thinking about the concept of a collective conscience, if it exists in reality and how would it function, how could we represent it. 

I have had the opportunity to live in a lot of countries with notably different cultures, beliefs and morals (France, my country of origin, the US, China, Spain and Colombia). In all of these countries I could definitely see that there were traits of character/personality, belief systems, social behaviors and moeurs that were common among the members of the cultural group and sometimes specific to these places and the groups of people living there. The specificity of the common mental and emotional traits could vary according to how much you zoomed in to the cultural group: certain traits are specific to families, others to a city, a region, a country, a continent. To what degree is your experience of reality affected by the filters that you have placed upon you by your social environment? How much of what you see and, in consequence, understand and believe you (as in the essential You) and how much of it is those around you? Is there any literature or studies done to observe shared beliefs and ways of thinking among family members? Do we inherit the personality structures of our parents (whether we choose to embrace them or fight them is another question)? If so, is that way traits like alcoholism is hereditary?

I can't shake the belief that there is some commonality to personality and belief systems to groups of people. Having lived in different countries, I have observed that how people react emotionally to certain situations, how they construed the world around them, what they value and what they don't value were all very distinct from one population to another (and from one geographical area to another). I even get the feeling that you could see variations in the big 5 model from country to country. For example, I currently live in Colombia and people here drive like crazy, they make very dangerous moves on the highway, their infrastructure and sign system is poorly designed, they park in a way which completely ignores the way it will affect traffic and I can go on. In the mean time, in France, where I am from, people are much more cautious on the roads, respect the road rules and are careful to give way to pedestrians. What contributes to a situation arising where you can have two groups of people do something so differently? I know I am coming down harsh on the Colombians, its difficult for me not too as someone who is stressed out driving in this country but other foreigners and even locals feel the same way and have told me so, so I am not alone.

If you consider that personality is inheritable, then your personality is, to some degree, made up of your parents personality, and theirs to their parents and so on. So if we all share this hereditary source, wouldn't by extension we all share personality traits on a macro level and to what degree can those traits be transformed by the actions of the individuals?

If there is literature that is accessible to the broader public on personality traits and groups of people, I am interested.

Thanks for any thoughts you can share on the issue.

Ugy-Mf3QKxuiTVJROUl4AaABAg,Ryan Grube,1503284717240,"Peterson often suspects psychedelics to be the cause of mystical experience. As far as I understand (which isn't far),  chemicals (medicine, drugs, alcohol etc.) simply induce effects that the mind was already capable of producing on its own in other circumstances.

As I say, this is probably wrong and may not get to the heart of the matter, but Professor Peterson doesn't seem to have articulated it this way as far as I can tell, but that may, of course, be due to error on my part.

It is also true that God wants us to venture out in a manner that is respectful of ourselves (particularly our divine self) and requiring faith."

UgzmcWNToxLPn139HKx4AaABAg,Archi Monday's,1503284737204,"The Room thing really does fascinate me. I took a few weeks to really think about it, when I heard it originally. I thought about the differences between my mother and I. She is intensely creative yet obsessive.  Her choice of wall decoration, her choice of curtain, her clothes, even the stand she uses for paper towels. The whole of the home is filled with visually complex, and pleasing items. They are kept neat always. About once a month she feels the need to either take away or add to the collection. 

I too am creative, but have always been a little more chaotic with my belongings. My items were also much more industrial in nature. Steel shelves, a tool box, blank shirts; I've even said that if there were shoes with no logo, I would buy them.

I began to hang and find more visually abstract items to display, wear, and use. It has now been a month. I have tried hard to be indifferent to the changes. I do think that the increase in abstractness of my functional items has contributed to a compulsory retention of their orderly state. 

I then therefore wonder if creating a more compatible environment for oneself could be considered a viable tool? 

I guess even if I am over analyzing, somehow I have managed to free myself of the coffee cup invasion from hell."

UgxTU3dTFTGy2547Btp4AaABAg,Brendan Tannam,1503284737247,"That was a really super lecture. I got a strong feel for the level of sacrifice asked of Abraham. God, I guess, was not going to make this man a father of nations (and the father of the line leading to the Messiah and ultimate salvation) without the demonstration of the utmost commitment from him to the covenant between the two of them. More importantly for me, because I’m an atheist, I appreciated the theme of positivity, willingness for change, aspiration and the display of pretty good standards of human behavior most of the time. Most of this information comes to me a bit too late in life – I’m closer to the stage where “Abraham expireth, and dieth in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered unto his people” Genesis 25:8). I hope that younger people who take on the challenge of a life of aspiration understand that it will most likely involve ‘a journey to the underworld’ in terms of suffering. I used to think of this in Christian terms like “But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. ""Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened."" (1 Peter 3:4). Dr. Peterson has taken this concept out of the confines of one religion and explains the phenomenon as an archetype for all humanity. Wonderful teaching!"

UgydhYcQbeCXgsWc0S54AaABAg,Kadranos,1503284737278,"On the lie: there is an old concept that those who would commit an offense against the truth have no right to possess it.  In this case, the truth is that Abram and Sarai are married, and the Pharaoh's intent probably would have been to destroy that God-blessed truth.  Given that, Abram is forced into doing something which is bad for himself on some level, but Pharaoh suffers because he forces that upon Abram.  I know it's overdone, but the comparison with the Gestapo seeking out Jews who you are harboring.  It is obviously right and heroic to harbor them, and obviously right and heroic not to tell the SS, but how does one avoid telling them indirectly?  Ultimately, who is responsible for the situation at all, and what are the motives?  I think that's a key element with Abram.  Him dying is bad for him, but killing him is bad for Pharaoh for that is very evil.  So Abram is preventing multiple evils, and he gets to keep the phat lootz because they were not his intent (which could have easily been a scheme).

On the ritual of splitting the animals and moving between them: it had to do with ritual pacts between people.  Typically both entrants passed together through with the message being something like ""if I violate this pact, let the same happen to me,"" and then they ate of the flesh to incorporate it into themselves and to celebrate the union.  By God only passing through, it signifies God taking in full the consequences of violation of the covenant and Abraham coming out unscathed.  Foreshadowing of Christ.

I was also taught that raham as a word has something to do with love, so Abram became father of the nation by incorporation of love into himself.  Which was a consequence of drawing closer to God.

Your friend was right to scold you for calling God as depicted in the old testament unmerciful and harsh.  Especially when we look at things like the cult of Mulloch and fiery Gehenna."

UgzjfdiOORmalF96GxB4AaABAg,algol291,1503284741731,"33:05 Dr. Peterson, I hope you read this. There is a huge logical problem with this argument, or analogy. 
Peterson relates acting ""forthrightly"", which is in itself subjective, to the Biblical quote he provides. If God were to speak to you as He is said to have spoken to Abraham in the quote, there is absolution in what you are doing. The Creator has told you how to prosper, and if the Creator cannot be trusted, nothing in life can. So, when God tells Abraham that He will show Abraham the way, this can be considered the only way to an objective, nominal action. Abraham is guaranteed prosperity. 
At the end of the video, Peterson tries to liken a desire to leave one's home, for whatever reason or passion, as equivalent to divine intervention, and that is not what was intended by the writings of Genesis where the original quote comes from. 
Someone else must see the fallacy of his argument. Peterson actions standing for free speech are commendable, but he should not be taken at his word. And, I do like the allegories he presents in works of fiction, even if they were not intended by the original author. Life just cannot be simplified to a formula for happiness. We discover what makes us content. That is why humanity is so diverse."

It took me 2,5 years to come to terms with the depth of the experience, but I am also arriving at the conclusion that - despite all of the malevolence, which was definitely present - ""the part of him"" that gave me all of the necessary clues for my own process must apparently have been accessible by ""that which is Good"". Otherwise he would not have been able to provide me with necessary information. Also, I am quite sure that nobody else could have done it. Nobody is born ""evil"". From what I've experienced, I would say he acted out exactly what he has experienced. So I can confirm that it is absolute hell. But he experienced it at a pre-verbal stage, which must have severely interfered with his development, and kept him stuck in ""a loop"" where the brain wants to resolve the trauma, but doesn't know how. In some twisted and sick way, there is a ""soul"" captured within the psychopath that also wants redemption, and the only way it can seek it - because of the dysfunctional development - is through showing others what has happened to them, by acting it out."

The biblical stories can not be seen as progressive or libertarian, the entire notion that the story of the tower of babel was a story about god giving a warning about tyranny is absolutely wrong, that is the story of mankind being condemned to ignorance for eternity, being punished for eternity and it is deeply traditionalist, not progressive, PROGESS IS NOT A BIBLICAL IDEA, the bible is describing our loss of god and descent into the material world and every story is a continuation of that narrative until revelations when god destroys the world...

and furthermore,  Abraham lies about his wife being his sister because after god condemned man to their diverse languages and cultures (unique nations) of which Egypt was one, WHAT INEVITABLY DESTROYED NATIONALISM AFTER WE WERE CONDEMNED TO IT?   the next natural sequence of self destruction would be MARXISM, LEFTISM... the entire notion that Egypt was a tyranny is bullshit, Egypt was a nation that had it's own unique culture and history and language, and this story in the bible is showing how after man got condemned to having different languages and territories (nationalism) the next thing man did was try to conquer and kill and overthrow their neighbors out of ignorance, MUH OPPRESSION, MUH INSTITUTIONAL RACISM, and that is what this story is about..

Abraham was just like all leftists, lying about his slavery and crying about his ""oppression"" and using threats of terrorism to overthrow the pharaoh, if you actually read the story of the jews leaving Egypt, if you read the Passover story Jews recite IT READS EXACTLY LIKE THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO.   Saul Alinsky and ""rules for radicals"" is absolutely no different than ""the ten plagues"" that the leftists Abrahamics used to overthrow Egypt, which was the most advanced civilization in the world at the time.  The moral of this story is after we are thrown from heaven and condemned to different nations that lieing and committing crime pays! of course it does!  we are dieing as time goes on and the longer we are further from god!  crime pays, is that not exactly what we see in the world! why? because we are cursed by god and falling into time and entropy.

 it is about the descent of man into Marxism as the necessary descent which follows after nationalism (Egypt),  this is how nations are cursed and overthrown.  Abraham is not a ""moral icon"", an ""example to follow"", he is just another brick in the wall of human descent into hell..

NONE OF THE BIBLICAL CHARACTERS ARE EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW, THEY ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO FOLLOW BECAUSE IT IS THE STORY OF DESCENT INTO HELL AS REVEALED IN THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS... IT IS THE CONDEMNATION OF THE MATERIAL WORLD AS IMPLICITLY EVIL AND WICKED AND DESTRUCTIVE.

and after the anarchists overthrow Egypt what do they do? wander around aimlessly because the leftist bullshit narrative of ""freedom from tyranny"" was such a lie that it only took 40 years for the wandering Israelites to realize that they were not free but were actually falling into time and entropy which is exactly what happens when you destroy nationalism using Marxism and you get freedom... So what did they do? they brought tyranny right back using the 10 commandments!!!!! HAHAHAHA  they overthrew the big bad tyranny of Egypt just to create a new one once they realized freedom is being in time and it leaves you wandering aimlessly until you wake up and realize you are being eaten alive and so you create a new tyranny to save you from freedom.   And what happens then? their temples are then destroyed?  Of course they are! because this is the story of a primal perfection which is slowly being eaten and condemned to nothing.

""Freedom"" is nothing else but falling off the slithering snake of time, tyranny is the closest to god you can be.  the bible is NOT PROGRESSIVE, NOT IN THE LEAST BIT, NOT AT ALL PROGRESSIVISM, NOT AT ALL LIBERTARIANISM, THE MESSAGE IN THIS STORY IS THAT WE ARE IN HELL AND LIEING AND USING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE FORCES YOU DON'T LIKE WILL BRING YOU WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE EVERYTHING YOU FOUGHT FOR COME UP EMPTY AND HOLLOW AND MEANINGLESS JUST LIKE WHAT YOU RAN FROM, 

Jordan Peterson is a progressive and he is simply paying lip service to Jews who are replaying their Abrahamic Marxist masochistic fantasies in all of their anti tyranny propaganda to gain wealth from stories which if you understood them properly would not make you wealthy.. these stories were hijacked by Jews and progressives in order to reshape them into something that you could profit off of, they are nothing more than Add to dictionary, THEY ARE FREEDOM PIMPS, in their descent into freedom using Marxism... everything that condemns ""the state"" is progressivism and Jordan is merely a progressive in disguise as a traditionalist, he's not, he's wrong, and his interpretation is completely wrong.  

When Jordan Peterson said ""well I guess its okay to lie if you are aligned with the highest good of being"" you just justified every social justice warrior that wanted to make up science and language because the ends justify the means... YOU JUST DID EXACTLY WHAT THE BIBLE SAID YOU WOULD, YOU SOLD YOUR SOUL TO BE PROGRESSIVE , YOU JUST WENT FULL SJW POST MODERNIST.  with that justification, that apology for Abraham, seeing him as a model for behavior who might just be flawed, instead of a simple explanation as to how civilizations are destroyed and rebuilt in a mutilated version, you became no different than any Marxist or leftists that you hate."

Try opening your mouth wide open and making a R sound without moving your lips to get the idea.)
Adding the ah sound when the name changed to Abraham in hebrew spelling is simply adding the letter ""hey"" 'ה which is the short way of writing down the word ""god"" - hadonai.
So the name change symbolized that now god rests within him and is part of him.

Sarai - my counselors, ministers in plural (Phonetically: Suh like suffer, rye like the bread.)
Sarah - Minister in singular form (Phonetically: Suh like suffer, Ra like rumble only with the open R originating from the throat). Also in this case the ""hey"" is added though this time at the end and not middle of the name.

Noah obeyed God, but that's only half the story.  By obeying, Noah submitted to the dominant force and changed in accord with new demands.  So it can be seen either way.

Yes, YOU/ME are evil AND good, but the problem is deciding for YOURSELF which is which; and that's why these stories are important, but ONLY you can decide. 

This is the underlying truth of Dr Peterson's biblical message: We have faced these same facts since the beginning of time, and these ancient stories contain the wisdom learned long ago when life was a whole lot harder.

Our greatest gifts always contain our greatest flaws; our plentiful society has created ungrateful and resentful people. Why?
They've lost touch with their inner shadow because they've never really had to face it.

One has to separate themselves from the general malaise (maybe your company you work for).  Sometime leaving is the only option left.  But nowhere (correct me if I'm wrong) did Jesus ever refer to the people disparagingly as ""the herd"" ""the rabble"" ""the crowd"" ""you rebels"".  Becoming ""an individual"" is the result of the ""fear and trembling"" of growing up, or so it seems to me.  But when a person alienates themselves too far they get elitist, authoritarian, or just plain nuts. I think we all are products of our culture,  Limitations we have to work with.

Additionally, there was a cultural practice to elevate one's wife to the blood status of ""sister"" for the rules of inheritance - often times done in to keep the wife from becoming destitute if there is no issue - as the laws of inheritance flowed via the male line, and reverted to the eldest surviving brothers if no children are present.  (The story of Abram took place prior to the rules of either Levitical Marriage or the ""loophole"" for having only daughters as evidenced via the 5 Daughters of Zelophehad.  The latter is also exemplified by Joesph and Mary, allowing Jesus to be of the legal Line of David [via Mary], yet exempt from the blood cursed branch of the Line of David from Jeremiah 22:30 [via Joseph].)"

Ugx4nGfocegeE6MyS5h4AaABAg,Softtonguesbreakbones,1503284771331,"Much of JP's practical wisdom, some of it almost word for word, reminds me of my conversations with a high school Theology teacher. (for example, once in class he exclaimed ""rights!? You only hear about human rights from the left! What about responsibilities? All rights have a corresponding responsibility."" And ""freedom? Freedom to do what? Pure freedom to do anything has never made anyone happy. It's anarchy."") 

He was an abrasive character who was disliked by administrators for his direct manner of speaking and refusal to capitulate to sentiments which sacrificed truth for ""inclusion,"" ""caring,"" and ""diversity"" (it was a high school for girls run by open and agreeable types).  He talked me out of nihilism when I was depressed which prevented me from committing suicide as a 15 year old. Like Jordan Peterson is for a lot of people, this man was one of the most important teachers I had. 

That's all to say, it's a blessing Peterson has become so popular, because I realize not everyone is as lucky as I am to have been educated by someone grounded in Western tradition.

They're the child who dipped their toe in the pool water, rather than just jump in.  they were the child who would prefer to know what's in the present rather than enjoy the anticipation.  The person unwilling to take a chance, the cat at the corner of the block petrified to go outside their boundaries.  Those unwilling to drop their egos, and those afraid to clean their rooms or to go into the areas of their house they have neglected.  
The people who prefer to distance themselves into a artificial game world, rather than take the bull by the horns and live their lives in the today.

Those atheists that are like zealot Pentecostal tongue speaking religious freaks who believe only their congregation are going to heaven.  That wish to shove their beliefs into others faces, wanting to bring them down to their miserable level, because misery likes company.  And if you're atheist, that's your own choice.

There could be a reason so many people come to attention at the sound of ""responsibility"".  Could be many people are feeling ""called"" ( I think Heidegger wrote a book about being called).  Psalm 107 addresses what happens when one refuses a call.  You end up behind iron bars.  Maybe God is about to do somethin new in the world, maybe.

You mentioned how the one who plays the most games is also the one that meets chaos and conquers it before the chaos reveals itself; but you also said you didn't know why it is true. 

I believe the answer lies in the person's unwillingness to let anything control him. My dad taught me a lesson in chances and  opportunity, in that it was like waiting for someone to knock on your door vs knocking other doors finding opportunity. I believe that the person who is able to knock on doors must also be able to defend himself from chaos, and must be adaptive to the and be able to predict where lurks. 

So I think best adaptors to the games are also to the best adaptors to the chaos, and the best way to adapt is to be perceptive. So, I think the simplest way to put it is that the people that confront chaos before it reveals itself are the people that pay the most attention, which thus allows them to adapt to whatever game better.set of games and how the person who plays the individual game right, is the one that gets invited to more games.

The clinical psychologist who shot to fame in 2016 for opposition to Canada’s “C-16 bill” — critics called him “transphobic” for his refusal to use genderless pronouns — said Google is refusing give him access to his YouTube account. The timing coincides with attempts to upload a new installment of his biblical lecture series, which has garnered over 1 million views.
“Google is refusing to reinstate my account. Violation of terms of service. No explanation given,” he began a series of tweets. “@joerogan @RubinReport @scrowder @SamHarrisOrg I’ve been locked out of YouTube & my personal account: violation of terms of service.

What makes my wary of him is how he seems to be drawing-in a large number of Alt-Right Fundamentalist types, who hold to a monochromatic black/white true/false view of reality; now coalescing, and far beyond his immediate control. 

The Bible (to me) is best thought of as a psychic Rorschach; you can read into it or out of it what you will according to your own patterning and beliefs. But the belief in an anthropomorphic Father God frowning down at us from above seems to have done more damage than good for humanity as a whole, so far.....Yahweh's power (and Jesus by proxy) to inflame people into acrid rigidity if not homicidal self-righteousness, self-immolation is very spooky.....with no end in sight.

""And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?

""And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place;  and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

""And yet indeed she is my sister;  she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother;  and she became my wife.   

""And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.""

I feel like this life philosophy is not complete without articulating the ability to evaluate a hopeless cause. For instance, I think that we would all agree that the 3-5 year plan in the future authoring program would have little application in North Korea and the liberals who want to destroy western society seem to believe (or act out) the concept that the  west is almost as lost as North Korea. 

I believe you are probably giving sound advice but I've believed that about other people before and was decidedly incorrect. Following incorrect advice can be very costly time-wise. Why is maintaining the status quo better than socially walking into the chaos/dragon that might have virgins and gold for us?"

Ugwpz1B77StZ3phxr3h4AaABAg,rstlesswarrior,1503284805113,"Professor, unrelated comment: You sound pretty resentful yourself when talking about atheism and atheists. I don't see how that serves anything but your and your audience's intellectual satisfaction. Especially when for example addressing Dawkins and publicly suggesting he might have been molested seems, even if it's plausible from the perspective of a psychologist, rather disrespectful and unproductive.
Also he is obviously not an Atheist according to your definition of belief. 
Considering that Dawkins' Meme-Theory is incredibly useful when it comes to explaining the emergence of religious stories, I think he earns a bit more respect. 

You are pushing a lot of people away with the almost spiteful way you talk about atheists. Especially when they aren't even atheists according to your definition.
Most of my peers as well as myself turned away from religion and the belief of God because:
A: the literal belief in a higher power and religious stories seems silly and
B: the hypocrisy of righteous religious people equating this literal interpretation to morality, while not living one bit more moral. (which in my experience is a pretty typical behavior among Christians and that's coming from Germany) 

You have opened my eyes when it comes to religion and belief, but you could reach so many more if you'd adress those who maybe need it most in a more forthcoming way, even if it isn't as satisfactory as talking down to them. 

Best wishes and my highest respect, 
-Someone who cleaned his room and finally oriented himself thanks to you"

UgzQSnPu7NHMSng5jaZ4AaABAg,Noah Friebel,1503284806901,"We have seen our father naked
his shame and insufficiency laid out for us to see.

Upon his uncovered body lies boils, and tumors, the oozing of puss from new wounds and the blackened dry blood from old.
Corruption inhabits each member of his flesh.
His hands are smeared with pools of blood not his own.
The smell of the rotting flesh envelopes us.

Out of his crusted lips comes a soft murmur, but none of us can understand his mumblings.
A haze lays over his eyes: no longer able to see us.
Someone calls out to him, but he no longer understands our words.

A few of us turn away in shame and disbelief.
They speak to one another reassuring themselves about his health and vitality as they block their noses.

Some others look on and laugh in mocking at his bareness and weakness, veiling their anxiety and disappointment.

Many of us just stare on in horror and fear.

A voice cries, “Look at the corruption in his limbs, he must surely be close to death!”
Another responds, “If we just put some clothes back on him I’m sure he will be alright.”
Yet another voice cries, “This is right and good, he was a murderer and a thief, why should we not aid in his death?”

What great feats must be made to save him, great personal sacrifice and much burning of dead flesh."
