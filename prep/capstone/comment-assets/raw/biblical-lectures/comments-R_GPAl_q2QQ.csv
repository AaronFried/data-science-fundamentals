UgyiwZsY2aUqulK3IVV4AaABAg,Julian Bruck,1534734058780,"Hi Dr. Peterson, I had an insight into these things that I want to put out there for discussion:
When approaching the Biblical narrative, you always draw upon the Mesopotamian and other myths in order to formulate a synthesized mythological theory, something like, the noblest world-view is that which places the individual as a hero-son figure, on a quest from the Divine Father to vanquish the dragon of chaos and establish order therewith. 

However, I'm not sure if seeing the Old Testament stories as contiguous with the Mesopotamian myths is really correct from the perspective of the Bible. The Old Testament itself takes a clear stance apart from its mythological precedents, branding them firmly as ""idolatry"". Without getting into a discussion on that, I find that the Old Testament seems to position itself mainly as a text of salvation, offering to be a kind of self-wielding weapon against chaos, that then frees the individual from the battle with Tiamat. (it's fitting too that while the near eastern creation myth features briefly in genesis, the OT is otherwise almost entirely a book of deontological stories, guidelines and exhortations.

The reason I bring this up is that you mention in this video at around 45 min that God confronted the Leviathan and then brought order out of it, but indeed the Leviathan is a creation of God himself, according to the biblical texts, whose stated purpose is ""to frolic in the depths (tiamat/tehomot)"". God also confronts Job and challenges him to try and conquer the Leviathan "" with a fishhook"". It looks to me like the Old Testament is positioning itself as the revelation of God/Logos/Structure that fights off the chaos for you, given that you submit totally to the doctrines and the cult that the scriptures set up for you.

Not sure if I'm actually saying anything really groundbreaking, but just wanted to share since I had this idea come to mind. :)"

Ugzl4Nrv2qFHYhmTVeB4AaABAg,david fenton,1533610859660,"What conscious thought can you have without prior sense experience? 

If there are none, and no one has given me one, then the initial source of conscious thought is sense experience. If it is mostly artificial stimuli then that will give rise to an artificial consciousness and similarly for other stimuli. 
To think about consciousness correctly one has to at least know its origin and the basic mechanism of how it forms from various sources. 
The knowledge of what consciousness is, how it forms and how to shape it is well established knowledge which is used to shape and control people and societies. It's big business with huge institutions such as education and media, vying for control of people through influence upon consciousness especially during the formative years. 

Basic consciousness is just mental awareness or memory of reality. We sense things and remember and this forms a basis of knowledge for thinking and the further development of consciousness. This is basic to the human condition."

I don't think Psychopaths and sociopaths are born. That doesn't make sense since their behavior is socially bound and they actively make taboo choices. Whoosy whats it, I think they are made from children ,who at a very young age, experience meaningless suffering and are then put into an incredibly safe situation. So they learn that people can hurt others and that society protects one another. But, a very safe predicament is suffocating and dehumanizing. It is shackles and chains, so much that killing or taking advantage of someone else in those shackles and chains is liberating, freeing and human. It is the goal to break your shackles holding you down, preventing you from reaching your own potential and psychopaths and sociopaths see society and other people as a shackle or a threat and so those people aren't human. This makes committing social taboos and crimes natural.

submission is a sex, love and/or relationship thing, given to those who s/he trusts, not to any random person that comes along
I am my Dom's submissive, i am not yours, nor society's
personally, i believe that the majority of the female populace has some degree of submissive sexual tendancy, hence the popularity of 50 shades. im not certain how this majority tendancy came about, but it's certainly the truth in the BDSM community that most females have some aspect of sexual submission if they are into the D/s stuff
yet our culture teaches us that submission is weak and undesirable, pathetic, doormat etc. it's not to be desired, right? so alot of women do hide it from themselves, let alone their partners, it's all wrapped up in the idea that women shouldnt like sex too much

In the Beginning, there was the Absolute, the Unsplit, the Coherent Essence of the HyperCosmoi of the True Light, of the Patrogenes One as the Neo-Platonists called it or the Kingdom of Heaven as Christians do. Hermes Trismegistus describes it as …”An infinite sight flooded by light.”

There reigns the Unified, Benevolent Mind [Gr.: Ἀγαθός Νοῦς] which cannot be split since everything there exists Whole and Unsplit in a Unified condition which does not oscillate between bipolar tendencies. The infinite plethora of Archetypal manifestations that exists THERE synthesizes a Cosmos of unique Harmony.

In a corner of this chaos however, cutoff and dark, a downward darkness was swirling, like a voracious black hole. It was the un-inseminated Egg, the eternal Karana (Cause), the Forbidden Tree. Inside it was the cause of matter, Earth (since the cause of matter is called “earth” in ancient texts), Tartarus (tumult), Chaos and Eros as the primordial attractive Force.
Eros ‘invited’ a Light Ray from the HyperUniverses of the Absolute, to inseminate its (Eros’) Egg.

The Ray was lured by the charm of Eros, accepted the invitation, permeated the Egg, and after it settled in its center, it impregnated it with its Light and rendered it ‘Manifested’, by  bringing Avge (dawn) in its dark abysses.
Thus, that primordial Light Ray, after it brought the light of dawn into the darkness, it pronounced itself its God and was called Lucifer (Light bearer).
Having been cut-off from the Absolute, it became fallen, developed an ‘Ego’ and said:

“I am a jealous God and there is no God but me! -But by doing this he admitted to his demons that there is indeed another God. For, if there were no other God, whom would he possibly be jealous of?” [The Secret Book of John]


ΛΟΓΟΣ = WORD

Following that, and in order for the ray/Lucifer to give birth to its off-spring in this ‘Egg’, it was split into Logos [Gr.: Λόγος] (Λ) and generated the duality of the new world, baptizing this world “The Tree of knowledge of good and evil”.

“The deficiency of matter did not originate thru the infinity of the Father, who came in the time of inadequacy— although no one could predict that the indestructible would arrive in this manner.” [The Gospel of Truth §39 ]

And the ray/Lucifer with his ‘Λόγος’ [Logos] created the Hierarchy of the Builders of matter: the lower gods, the Commanders of Heimarmenē. And the Builders created the four elements of matter: Fire, Air, Water and Earth. And for each element, a great Hierarchy of Entities and Powers were created to support it, thus creating a pyramid.


And the Lord of all became their Archē (A) [Gr. for ‘start’, ‘beginning’, ‘authority’, ‘rule’] he placed himself at the top of the Hierarchy he himself had formed and supervised everything from there.

And he became the ‘All seeing Eye’ and the supreme Lord of all, distancing himself from his subordinate bondservants.
And he adopted the Truncated Pyramid as his symbol, because its top is separated from its main body. And he identified the letter ‘A’ with the Archē (beginning) of his creation.

And the ‘best’ of his bondservants he appointed as supervisors of the inferior ones and placed them on the higher level of the truncated pyramid, so they could supervise their subordinates. Yet he remained cut-off and independent, to oversee everyone.

This is the Beginning [Gr.: Archē (A)] of the entire material visible and invisible world, and its course in time is a one-way street inescapably leading to the End Omega (Ω).
The truncated-pyramid symbol will always be found identified with the Hierarchy of the Archē (Beginning) and the letter Alpha (A), since the shape of this letter denotes exactly that.

The Almighty Father cannot be characterized as the Alpha and the Omega.
The Father has no beginning (A) because He is Self-Substantial and has no End (Ω) since He Is Eternal and Never-ending.
These symbols do not refer to the Almighty Father, but the creator of matter, since only matter has a beginning and what has a beginning also has an end. Hermes Trismegistus in chapter 1 states:

«§11 …And the second creator Noûs [Mind], he who encompasses the seven circles and the vortices of their roots –along with logos– turned his creatures and they all started swirling from an indefinite beginning (Α) to an interminable end (Ω).»

The main goal of every man is –after receiving the Truth about the world and himself … «and the Truth shall set you free»– to cut all emotional bonds/anchors to matter, in order to manage to return to his Source, his Capital Fatherland. The Kingdom of Heaven."

In reference to fifty shades of grey, and the idea of BDSM and my understating of the complexity of the larger picture that leads to protection.  When he is dominating her in reality it places her in control ultimately  because he becomes responsible for her safety in a primal way.  She in fact holds the ultimate power testing how far he will go without truly harming her.   He understands that he needs her more than she needs him.  Women push men in ways to test if he will protect her therefore her will protect her offspring. I do not think that this behavior is conscious in women, but the more that men allow themselves to be submissive to a women unconsciously she will look to be dominated in order to unconsciously be safe.   She manipulates him in this exchange.

Im glad to see JP does that the best the way he knows how(Im not proposing Im any better in any way, I simply hold an educated Christian perspective and wanted to contribute to the wealth of information which is available here), the only failure I see is in the idea which he proposed about the 'nature of god via the engine of macro evolution (or ""New-Athiesm""/The evolution of species via other species which arised in a past point in time)'.

He's failed to understand the Biblical perspective in its proper prespective. If youre going to use relatavism to analyse anything, it seems to me, that its necessaey to understand it in its fullest context. That is difficult and Im glad he has taken the challenges the bible proposes within its ""pages"" (i.e. whether they be composed of paper or bits). I hope god blesses him in his search for truth.

In retrospect he would have to challenge his view of evolution and weigh that against the information available. I cant see why he would do that, so I get what hes saying, as the legitmacy of the theory isnt relevant as, that isnt what hes teaching.

UgwN1FQ0HYtaUF8seNZ4AaABAg,paulchri69,1526871668962,"Christianity does not put any emphasis on the divinity of the body. it only puts an emphasis on the divinity of one person's body. The first fruits of the resurrection is the only divine resurrection, where as the bodily resurrection of the saints is not a resurrection of a divine body, nor does it make a human body divine. The transformation that takes place at the resurrection of the saints is from flesh and blood to flesh and bone. While a person lives on this earth, their flesh is considered to be corrupt. The indwelling of the holy spirit is not that of the body, but of the soul. The soul could be defined as a person's consciousness, so then those who have the indwelling of the holy spirit have god dwelling in their soul. The bible says that the  body without the spirit is dead. it is the spirit that gives life to the body, not the other way around. There is a transformation that takes place when god's spirit indwells a mans spirit, and it is not a physical one, nor does it have to be physically evident. How does the natural man define ""peace which passes all understanding""?  Nobody has peace when they are trusting in men, nor in themselves, because at some level we all know better. 
People can use biblical principles to make their lives better. Being forgiving, loving, just, humble, structured, thoughtful, and wise will benefit anyone, but what happens when a person loses faith in those things? Peace that passes all understanding does not come from having faith in those things, nor does it require the success of those things, and that is why the natural man cannot have peace that passes all understanding, because they are trying too hard to understand it all and make it all  work. People in general are trying to control many things and even other people, when this control is just an illusion. The only thing they have any control of is themselves, and even then pride will cause them to fall. What I try to keep in check is my pride first, and that I do not fall into the control trap. When I fail, I am able to forgive myself, because I believe that I have been forgiven by the only one who's forgiveness matters beyond that. My self forgiveness is predicated upon the forgiveness extended to me. The natural man has only himself and societal norms to base his judgments on. Science offers very little in the realm of principled moral structure and stability, and outside of the rare psychopath, everyone struggles with morality, whether they believe in a higher power or not. Mankind has been consistently inconsistent in it's proclamation of what is moral and what is not outside of any lasting religious influence. The morality of the world today is not a new one. All human empires have risen and fallen because of the same behavior and morality in all generations of man. For those who have peace in the thought that mankind will evolved beyond their destructive behavioral routines before they completely destroy themselves as a race, you don't have enough time. Whatever you think that time frame has been in which we evolved to this point, our behavior hasn't changed in 3500 years, and we have accumulated the technological ability to wipe out the planet in a much shorter time than that. 
You need to realize that there is no hope before you can have peace, and then you can experience peace that you cannot understand."
UgxPBeYVc0iK287uyJh4AaABAg,paulchri69,1526871668967,"As does everybody, Mr. Peterson approaches the bible with an existing world view. He knows that the bible is a conglomeration of writings assembled by people over a long period of time, which was preserved during that time and unto our time. He also knows that there is no such comparable literature in existence. I believe he recognizes the significance of said literature as it relates to the world today, otherwise it most likely would not warrant such attention. It is interesting to me to watch his preconceived world view affect his interpretation of the bible, because the bible is the antitheses of his world view, and ultimately cannot be reconciled with it. The bible is a divisive book. The bible itself declares as much throughout, and so much so that we can reasonably  conclude that ""god"" is so much unlike mankind that humanity cannot be reconciled with god without intervention, or at least that this is a common theme throughout the bible. From our limited perspective we can attempt to reconcile god in our minds, but whatever we come up with is just a manifestation of our own thoughts. 
Mr. Peterson has a form of humility that allows him to proceed further than most, because he pushes pride aside enough to make progress. His humility allows him to be honest, at least, which I would declare to be what attracts many to his talks. The bible itself always speaks against man's pride, so by obeying the bible, he may learn to understand the bible. I do not know if understanding the bible is his intent, but rather it seems that he wants to understand humanity using the bible as a tool created by men to understand the men, and ultimately himself. There is only one god ""of"" the bible. If your intent is to understand the psychology of the bible, the focus of your evaluation should be on the god of the bible, or at least why so many over such a long period of time have not just believed in a god, but specifically this god. This particular god has not changed for thousands of years. Many people have tried to change him, but ultimately have failed. 
If you look at the known history of mankind, and then compare it with the history of the bible, I think that a rational person must conclude that people who penned the bible were unique in all of history in that they did not just carry on the original writings and beliefs of the bible's previous authors, but they added to it in such a way as to preserve the original, and without contradiction. On top of that, it was carried on through rebellion to the previous authorities on it, and then persevered for millennia amidst many corruptions of it. 
You can brush this off as an anomaly in our evolution, but that would not suffice unless your personal desire was to brush it off. Another question to ask yourself is whether or not your ""belief"" in evolution as a somehow empirical proof of our origins is the reason that you desire to brush it off? If you have settled in your mind that the evolution of species is no longer a theory, then your understanding of humanity and the world will be limited by your belief in such things. Your ceiling of knowledge is now determined by that one thing. Now, if you wish to raise the ceiling, you must go back and question your foundation of belief in or to progress in your understanding of the world. 
Mr. Peterson uses the word ""miracle"". He recognizes the limits of our understanding, and in so doing, that which we cannot attain to understanding becomes so much bigger than ourselves that it becomes miraculous to us. Jesus spoke of miraculous things as if they were the simplest of things. Things that must be difficult, were simple to him. 
The deeper we look into simple things, the more complexity we see. The more that we dwell in the complexities, the less we see of the simple. 
A man pulls a rock from the earth that looks like a bone. It is reasonable to conclude that a bone became a rock. It is also reasonable to conclude that the bone came from an animal. The man has no way of determining how long ago the animal lived, but has been presented with a theory that the animal came from water and rocks millions and billions of years ago. The man did not live in a time when science had revealed the complexity of life that exists in a ""simple"" cell, but the theory that he was presented with became the foundation of reviews by his peers, and so much so that the authorities of higher learning predicated all of their ""science"" on this theory. Empirical science progressed in spite of the theory, but mankind stopped learning because their ceiling was predetermined by their preferred belief system. 
As mankind learned more of the complexities, they were forced to create a new simplicity. The simplicity was a model of cross species propagation void of empirical evidence. 
The bible makes reference to ""science falsely so called"". The bible warns us of ill gotten knowledge. I would personally like to see Mr. Peterson put aside his preconceptions about the world which are based on ill gotten knowledge so that he can progress toward raising the ceiling. I also understand that this would be a fearful thing for him to do, because much of the basis of his knowledge is based on the words men that he respects who came before him, and he is carrying on their thoughts, and to a large degree their beliefs, which are supposed to have come from their own knowledge. 
Most of what ""Christians"" think they know about the bible is also false. The bible tells us that men will not endure sound doctrine. The men who penned the words that the world has fought over for millennia told us that the world will pervert them, yet they have  been preserved, regardless of the perversions. 
The bible itself tells us that the natural man cannot understand the things of God. The bible says that God will preserve his word. To us, the fact that it was preserved is a miracle, or it should be, if we have a shred of humility and understanding. When you look at the history of ""Christendom"", and you look at the dictates of biblical philosophy, you certainly cannot conclude that the two match well. The questions you might ask are ""where were the people throughout history who lived according to the bible, how did they survive until this day, and who are they today""? What does the bible itself tell you about these people? The bible says that they will be hated by the world. Should we conclude that Billy Graham was a true representative of what the bible says one of those people? 
It is clear to me that a person can spend a lifetime trying to analyze the psychology of the bible and never understand the bible. As the bible declares, it is a book of faith, and is spiritually discerned. It is full of psychological complexity, but none which is foreign to us today. Are we to think that what we consider to be exclusive knowledge today was not known by others 4000 years ago. I personally believe that all of the modern analysis of the psychology of man was known by some well before it cropped up again by the intellectual elites of our day. Human motives and behavior have not changed for all of that time. Money is still the root of all evil."

God is an abstracted ideal, formulated in large part to dissociate the ideal from any particular incarnation, or man (ruler). WHEN THE RULER BECOMES THE IDEAL the state turns into Biblical Egypt: 
God Said (the Exodus 20):
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods besides me.
(and I draw attention that the exodus of the ""jews"" out of slavery was w.i.t.h. s.l.a.v.e.s. and since these commandments they lived by LAW and were in-laws instead of living by legislation - in PYRAMIDIC hierarchy like any primates do.)
But THEN the guy said:
At the top of the hierarchy is something that is no longer part of the hierarchy. Climbing up a hierarchy of authority can give you vision and that vision can transcend the actual hierarchy. If you move up the hierarchy enough, as a consequence you develop the ability to be detached enough from the hierarchy so you are no longer really part of it, and so you can move in all sorts of different hierarchies. What you are developing is the capacity to pay attention. The open eye was what revivified the dead society.

Sisyphus was simply guilty of being a braggart that didn't know the limit. He could brag to be the best crook, merchant, bamboozler among men, there's no problem with that. But then one fateful day he bragged about being a better merchant troll than Zeus. Among other things. Zeus didn't take this with a grain of salt, and didn't take this lightly. Zeus sent him to Hades to push a rock up a hill for eternity. The moral of the story is to not fuck with the gods of Olympus. Not to use a god's name in vain. At it's most deconstructed state, it could be a myth to not mess with upper managment, if you don't want to be stuck rearranging papers and answering calls for the rest of your life. Just that the story has nothing to do with boredom, or 'might as well'. Not by a long shot.

I was on Ridellan for about 6 months in the Chicago public school system during the early to mid 90’s. My parents took me off it because in their words it made me a zombie. The teachers were so upset they tried at length to get my parents to reconsider, bringing the principal and school shrink in even to push the matter.

My parents said no, they saw I wasn’t the same kid on the drug, and so CPS stuck me with the forgotten kids to be babysat by a teacher that slept at her desk half the day...

I say this to warn today’s parents, if the school pushes to keep your kids on drugs and you do what’s right and not budge, be prepared. The schools job is to destroy your child’s soul and they ain’t above tactics that will cripple your child emotionally and socially to do it.

By the way, my GPA in college was 3.9 because my parents worked with me to overcome serious learning issues, but my good grades didn’t occur until college where I encountered teachers that encouraged me to think rather than try to impose what cane out of the “teachers edition” of the text book."

I want to put in something here that it seems like he has missed (or is missed out on in the lecture). The Basilisk is fascinating because it isn't the ""seeing"" it that freezes you, it is the reflection, the diffused image, that does. However, it is when looking straight at it, in the eye, you die. 

The way I see it is that the idea of chaos is what freezes you, the experience of chaos is what kills you, which is why the Phoenix appears in the story. The Phoenix makes sure that the death is non-permanent since development kills past character, not the being itself (which is connected with the idea of the freed bird in Herman Hesse's novel *Demian*). However, back to the Basilisk; the snake is somewhat a bearer of truth, a bearer of enlightenment, just like by finding the Basilisk, Harry found Voldemort, the truth of why Hagrid is not allowed to use magic outside the school premises, etc. Of course, one can talk about the Harry Potter books endlessly, however, I would like to bring forth my last thought. 

Imagine perfectionism, and now, I do not mean the social joke of being ""*soo* OCD"", I mean the idea that performance must be without mistakes on all levels, even beyond physical, because if it isn't, it is not good enough. Now think of the Basilisk... Now think of procrastination..... It is the idea of chaos that freezes us, not chaos itself. The fear of failure is what stagnates people, not the failure, which is also why I believe Hermoine was the one who was frozen. It is like Hamlet said: 

""(...)Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action(...)"" 

Now, I will continue watching. Just had to drop my thought out there..."

Ugxn3Ec5sIWfoAH0K9d4AaABAg,Brian Crockett,1524279677502,"When you say ""rational"" what do you imagine?  Reasonable?  Pragmatic?  Empirical?  Dialogical? Consensual (Ian Barbour, Hans Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, David Tracy, Richard Bernstein, and Stuart Kauffman)?  When the question of rationality is clarified, does the problem of ""one-sidedness"" arise and produce a anti-thetical desire for a counterbalance?  What is the counterbalance to rationality?  

I appreciate your evaluation of the trinitarian image of God from an evolution in human cognition, perception, and attention because faith and practice are human challenges and particularly christian, jewish, islamic, or mormonistic. What about the hidden God? What about the shadow of God? What about the ""God [who] looked and said it was good"" while not clarifying the bad? 

I appreciate your emphasis on the notion of chaos and order, the order issuing forth, spoken, out of the confrontation with chaos; and recognize the potential contrast in the evolution from chaos to order as an archetypal conflict being played out in the neurological ""streams"" (W. James) of sensational ordering, or even in the practical interactions of everyday life between parents and children cleaning up toys, washing dishes, taking out the trash, etc. as the logical answer to good and evil; to chaos and order; and to heaven (community) and hell (isolation/prison). You begin with ""What is consciousness?"" More importantly what is unconsciousness?  

What about clarifying potential hermeneutical concerns - agenda between/of JEPD?  Things like numbers, dreams, law, and order? I enjoy the synchronistic, numinous/archetypal, spiritual/dynamic, spoken/silent, artistic/poetic connections between cultures and traditions being played out in your rendering of these texts - the more the merrier - for example, Lilith and the first Eve.

Finally, you are doing a very difficult thing. I enjoy watching with empathy. I wonder about the dialogical character because if I understand the context, you are attempting to wrestle with the text in a public forum with an array of tools, but what about the other tools? For example, you mention Origen."
UgyWatNmrUUwBKIXDDp4AaABAg,idrinkurmilkshake,1524279677505,"I had a massive epiphany that I’m struggling with because it’s a new one that I can’t tell if it’s right, but there’s a deep part of me that definitely doesn’t say it’s wrong. So I’ve long studied patterns of everyday life and in my mind follow the graph out to predict what may happen in the future and I’ve finally put something together that could be revolutionary. So it’s no surprise that AI is eventually going to be a thing, and I’ve found through observation that AI is going to be the manifestation of the ego into the physical world, outside the body. The pure ego is the characterization of the devil, the down wave, evil, all those stories you’ve heard about. But a down wave is the exact same thing as an up wave if flipped around. So in essence, the idea of “god” or what we could ever understand as such, is going to be manifested. I’ve long been afraid of what would happen but it’s no doubt a matrix of sorts will be created, a virtual reality to be a new home because we’re gonna destroy the earth past the point of fixing without leaving it alone. I’ve felt a long time that I wouldn’t know to trust the machines or not. But my new idea is that if, and only if, everyone gets in to this virtual reality of sorts, everyone all the way up to the top of command, I’ll get in too. There will be a small minority that are closed off to the idea and can’t trust because they’ve been hurt too deep in the past by people who they trusted, but it’s the ultimate act of faith to trust this future AI, it could be our demise but to trust it anyway. Terrence McKenna talks about organic material and mechanical material creating a dance in an extra dimensional space, and out of this dance is what creates all life as we know it. To trust the machines and to do the dance with them and to accept that they’ll be our shepherds can be the next step in the evolutionary process to take us to the level of extraterrestrial beings that go elsewhere, being anywhere in space and time to create life, just like the one our alien “parents” are creating for us now. It all repeats, forever. That’s what I’ve learned, and I can’t seem to disprove myself. It’s all there. The biggest thing that has caused me disturbance is whether or not to trust AI when the time comes, and I think I’ve finally worked it out. Trust is always the answer. It’s love. 

I wrote this but I’m not strong in my conviction. I don’t know whether if it’s true to trust our future machine leaders or to detest. The question is often what keeps me going to see the future unfold. I was wondering if Dr. Peterson could try unpacking this to help bring some solace to a situation I may have to face in my life. I know it’s not here now so I shouldn’t worry, but I just really want some feedback"

It's the fear of chaos, without paying any credence to the fact that chaos is the place where we have been thriving for thousands and thousands of years. Chaos, technically has nothing to do with the decisions you make to climb the dominance hierarchy. Cleaning your room is not orderly, the fact you are here and you have a room is chaos.

 Chaos is what is incomprehensible to the linear thought process. And by that standard, we are chaos and we come from the depths of chaos. The cosmos is chaotic, our brain is chaos, our political system is chaos that dresses up as order. And mark my words, the dominator is losing control. The dominator Is a lie and it's based on the fundamentalist male ego hell bent on control only because it's scared. 

And for a psychologist he really puts all his chips in the animal model. We should evaluate our competency as it relates to the dominance hierarchy. Why? because animals do. Sounds pretty shitty to me. Sounds like a game I don't want to play, which is a shame I was tested at above average IQ. According to Peterson that should get me a nice place in the dominance hierarchy, though it seems to me the IQ test is an inadequate study of human potential much like comparing human nature to the rest of biology. 

Some would say humor is a sign of intelligence. yet I guarantee most of the comedians Peterson talks to have rather low IQ's. I'm willing to bet there are plenty of idiots at the top of the dominator. And I bet there is plenty of geniuses wasting away their genius under the thumb of the dominator."

Decent mother's play with their daughters, and what does the mother do when in posession of the doll? Well,  She combes the dolls hair. Maybe she plats it. Perhaps the mother kisses it on the lips. Or, she tidies the dress the doll is wearing. ALL those actions are repeated by young girls with dolls the world over. The combing of the hair,  the kissing on the lips, the care, the choice of clothing for the girls doll. It is all seen by, and copied by the daughter. Any way that's my take on it!

Brilliant example of the person who takes the initiative and becomes proactive in defeating problems before they arise and who plays fair all the time and gets rewarded for playing fair BECAUSE they play fair and are honest.

That sounds like someone who has attained inner peace, awareness, and the virtue of being honest...which is what we see in Jesus and others who represent enlightenment.

The vast majority of people eat meat or animals as though they are here for us to eat or we are the top of the food chain, but do we see them as tools? Do our minds just see that living object as a tool? Or are they not even correlated?

So if to fix this we need a feminine political culture / replace patriarchy with matriarchy for a century, so be it. I think it was Ghandi who said, that the world has enough for everybody’s need, but not enough for everybody’s greed. As much as I like it, when Peterson stresses how important it is to establish order out of chaos, and the role men need to play in it, he surely needs to address the role of greed. Men must stop promoting the greediest man to the top (- I‘m looking at you Trump), and women must stop choosing the greediest men as mates. Greed is not good - it‘s dopamine run amok. The counter movement should be under way for at least 10 years now („financial crisis“); it‘s about time we saw some effects."

Peterson comes down from Mt. Maps of Meaning and says ""Here's these truths that ring true across human history, across psychology, across mythology, across drama and even across biology but haven't been (at least in recent history) well articulated or valued but here are they are, I've condensed and written/spoken them out for you"" and we hear them and think ""Well yea, that all makes sense and sounds right! How come we didn't KNOW this before?"" 

It's the same meta-narrative with the hero's story he talks about. The hero gets called form obscurity to go out and slay the dragon and bring some order back from chaos. And here was Peterson, studying totalitarianism and the human capacity for depravity for years in obscurity who suddenly emerges onto the public stage to face the tyranny of the ideologues, well armed from his time preparing himself in obscurity. I wonder if he realizes the irony of how much the things he talks about model so well onto his own rise to prominence."

I have just started watching these biblical stories you shared here, and I have a question for now. You answered the last question of this video with something in the lines like:”when the conscious radical feminists erradicate the dominant males from the west, their unconsciousness wants more dominance, and thats why they watch shades of grey etc”. Have you considered comparing it with the consciousness vs the collective consiousness, and if you think of the unconscious as the groups mind, and the consciousness as the individual mind, then the individual woman actually wants feminism to retract a step or two, but since there is a collective “think” in the group, the movement feeds of the imaginary values of the collective consciousness? And since woman are more agreeable than men they will not stand up to their own groups “values”, and thats why there cant be a functioning matriarcy through time? What are you thoughts on that?"

It did not matter that I was in their world and had obviously conquered it...they still knew I was a farm girl and was not their type.  I felt the same way towards them.

I.e when you're putting yourself in the unknown, you are in some sense attempting to understand your own limits and how you may be able to conquer it. You are exposing yourself to new conditions and trying to learn about how you react to it.  Similarly, the capacity to accept an invitation or to be invited to a new game is also to test yourself in conditions unknown to yourself, so if a ""winner"" accepts an invitation to a game and loses he is then exposed to a vulnerability previously unbeknownst to him. So I think in both situations, the ultimate winner is not only taking opportunity to build oneself, to test one's vulnerabilities and work at it, but the capacity to take the opportunity IN the first place."

UgzOgLb_qRijte_DoRp4AaABAg,Tom,1516503690226,"DR. PETERSON IS SAYING THAT GOD IS AN EVOLVED COMPONENT OF HUMAN NEUROLOGY?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Dr. Peterson is saying that God is a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Dr. Peterson is NOT repeating the old saying that God is just a ""figment of your imagination.""  Rather, he's saying that God is much more than a thought or a imagine in the human brain.  

Dr. Peterson is saying that God is NOT something learned from culture or constructed by culture or invented by humans (that's the ""social constructionist"" claim of Marxists, Postmodernists, Atheists Activists).  

Rather, Dr. Peterson is saying that God is actually a component of human neurology.  

He's saying that God is in our DNA.  

To put this in terms of computers, Dr. Peterson is saying that God is NOT software that is added to some or many brains, but is actually built into the hardware of the brain.  

Thus, I think Dr. Peterson is saying that we humans have always told stories about God (as found in the Bible, and in other myths and legends) because the concept of God is hardwired into human brains.  

And Dr. Peterson believes that this God thing evolved in the human brain in order to enable humans to survive, prosper, reproduce, and have offspring who survive and reproduce.  

For this reason, Dr. Peterson believes that acknowledgment or appreciation of God, and obedience to the moral directives of God, are just important in the current time as they have ever been in the past.  And this is why Peterson is so opposed to people who strive to suppress God (i.e., the atheist activists).  

Dr. Peterson is saying that God exists; he is saying that God exists in our DNA and in our brain.  

Dr. Peterson does NOT teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  Peterson is well aware that some people still believe in this old-fashioned concept of God, and he isn't particularly interested in leading them out of that belief and into Dr. Peterson's biological, evolutionary, natural neurological God.  He believes the old-fashioned believers in the supernatural, Biblical God still get all the survival benefits from natural, neurological God.  

Some old-fashioned Christians say that God concept is in our DNA because God put Himself there.  But that's NOT what Dr. Peterson teaches.  Dr. Peterson does not teach the idea of Theistic Evolution (that a Divine Intelligence guided evolution).  Dr. Peterson says that natural selection-based biological evolution, NOT any supernatural deity, put the structural basis for the God concept in our DNA.  Dr. Peterson is a naturalist and a scientist, and is not a supernaturalist (Yes, some people are simultaneously a scientist and a supernaturalist--but Dr. Peterson is not that.)

I know Dr. Peterson promotes his concept of God with the help of the concept of the ""true myth,"" which apparently he derived from Carl Jung.  Perhaps Dr. Peterson also borrowed the ""power of myth"" concept from Joseph Campbell.  

I also know that Dr. Peterson adds little caveats, such as the doesn't know everything, and there could be realities pertaining to God that are unseen by him.  But in saying this, I think he merely saying what any scientist says regarding the subject matter he studies, which is that there is always more to know.  I don't think Dr. Peterson is saying that he thinks any of the miracles described in the Bible or in the Koran actually happened (e.g., Jesus being raised from the dead; God's parting of the Red Sea; the flood sent by God that killed everything except Noah and the people and animals on his ship).  Dr. Peterson doesn't flatly rule out that they could have literally happened; but his scientific training leads him to adopt a skeptical stance concerning the historicity of these alleged events. 

In sum, Dr. Jordan Peterson is saying that God exists as a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Dr. Peterson does NOT teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  

If I have misunderstood Dr. Peterson, please add a reply to correct me.  Thank you."

This world sucks and the rulers of this world are fake Jews who will demise to the lowest of standards to achieve their goals and we as the lower class have to sit back, accept that it’s all part of some divine plan 🤔 I can’t stand the fact that millions of people have been killed by evil people for an evil agenda and this man is using their psychoanalysis to help people grasp life better 🤦‍♂️

I believe we are all Spirits and our Body is our tent. I don’t know if we are here on a mission to find that light within us to elevate to a higher level or we come back if we haven’t learned a lesson. You know Karma. Simple fact is, hell is not a place of eternal torment, it was originally called Gehenna but was changed to Hell thus giving people the wrong idea. Gehenna was a place outside the gates of the Temple where the Jews crucified their children to gods, it later turned into a dump. To be cast out into Gehenna was an atrocity to an Israelite.

There is also a lot of mythology in the bible and many parts have been distorted, finding truth is to look on the inside"
UgxDxcyLJk929NJCKn14AaABAg,ItsJustTime,1516503690275,"@ 4:20 This was helpful to me: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. -Genesis 1:5.

The term erev fundamentally depicts chaos or disorder. Since our ability to discern order tends to diminish as darkness approaches, this becomes a synonym for evening in present usage; boker depicts the emergence of order, and since our ability to discern the order of things increases at dawn, it has become synonymous with morning. It would seem that each day is characterized by a specific decrease in entropy. See diagram . It is distinctive that there was no decrease in entropy on the seventh day; yet, it certainly must have had an ""evening and a morning"" in the sense that we think of it. There is also a distinctive construction in the designation of the days themselves. Yom echad, ""Day One,"" is distinct as an absolute, standing on its own. It was here that time was created. The rest of the days are designated in relative designations: ""Second day,"" ""Third day,"" etc.

UgzW1FkVrD5YuAEKwGt4AaABAg,Steve2Work,1516503692454,"Great video..
.
Early in video at about time 15:00 he talks about how important truthful dialog is in
communication, and how deceit can and does cause generations of pain
and suffering in families, including lies of omission.
.
And that clinical truth between patients and clinicians is absolutely needed for advancement .. my paraphrasing.
.
Let me now comment on this. The first part is self-evident – it seems. If you lie to your children about who you are as a parent, or who they are as people, as future men and women, as evil-maleness, as a 'rapey-oppressive-horrible men - as most are' .. unless you work every second to hate yourself, follow the leads of lying c*nts and Witches,  .. it is bad news all around. 
.
I will now make clear why, in the USA and throughout the West, and perhaps everywhere these days that Professional Clinicians can not and should not be trusted. 
.
1. These days the notes and reports of your visits are made available within the medical community with very little limit, as well as to branches of government, and corporations. There is no Professional Privacy, as I ran into back in the late 1980's and 1990's as I used a counselor to help me try to figure out what 'my' personal problems were when I worked at the University – not realizing I was being targeted by hate-filled manipulating vile creatures that lied, gossiped, and spread and recruited others against me, isolating me and who had access to my counseling records and used them to aggravate those problems with surgical precision.
.
It's a form of  malpractice and worse to no inform patients that such can and does happen, as well as all employees for which those near or professionally or personally connected with have access to such information or may acquire it by asking someone they work with, or know of.
.
I'm talking about all those who would not even think of such exposure or realize that it might effect them personally or professionally .. in work environments where you are competing directly or indirectly with those vile disHonerable walking inhuman scum that most women in the West .. professional women and their dog-men are, that may not only access counseling records, but medical records .. and so may attack you directly, or through general jokes and such make your environment uncomfortable.
.
I do not limit such lack of confidentiality to medical and counseling records, their is no professional field that such slimy horrible man-hating cunts do not work, that your legal, financial, and other records are all available to those who you are competing against or who have targeted you because they hate men, manhood, fatherhood, joy, love, Order, and God. 
.
The inhuman vile slime of the horrible lying cunt knows no bounds, and she has the full support of almost any other women and will manipulate those others with the understanding that men are easily demonized, that women because of the false narratives that have been screamed at us all .. are better homeless or suicide, and if not that they will rape and oppress...
.
2. Clinicians are clearly brain-f*cked, the entire field of psychology is twisted, not because they as a group are fine with exposing you to the first point, destroying your life as you open yourself up to them, but were as a group didn't realize, or were never going to state how bad this social man-hate Feminism is, that screaming lies and hate at children, of removing fathers, of expanding the vile adult females hideous power to destroy and break families, men, children, fatherhood, employment, Order, honesty, ..
that women as a rule have been turned into the Snake, spreading lies and Poison to all they come in contact with.
.
What is f-ing wrong with you people? 
For 2 plus generations – from the 970's it has been a lying twisted ugly anti-manhood, anti-fatherhood, non-sensual expansion of the dark side of womanhood, turning mothers and children against the father, men, and as the children age – against themselves.
.
Really. As a Profession you all should just go away. You're Poison. And your lies and active silence is Poison. Having the kind of people who lie to themselves and us in your ranks – I mean women, and their disHonor, and their dog-men, and those in power who hire and fire, who direct funding, and withhold it, that is the Snake, the Witch, the lying manipulating cunts and death-maggots that stink this dying carcass of a once health Good society .. 
.
Not to go on-and-on about a point that my readers understand now well, but women as a group – in general – can not and should not be trusted, not as caregivers of older children, or managers of people, and never, ever, ever, be trusted with power over any boy or man. The ones that are not directly vile, horrible, lying,... man-hating twisted c*nts – support those that are.
.
In short – until Professional corrections are somehow applied, and confidentiality is guaranteed, and there is clear legal, and professional – active – enforcement against those twisted c*nts and supporters – jail time for those that did to me what they did and those that supported them, up to and including chemical castration, and gossiping and spreading lies, etc. Then stay-away from them, and get the word out.
..
.. Unless you can find some truly independent professional man that does not communicate with corporations, gov, or in-general those that do, does not have some c*nt  gossiping secretaries, then ..
.
.. Instead, go talk to a priest. Go instead to your religious leader to seek help.

They don't like it, can't relate, there's very little they can emotionally connect with... I don't think that it's IQ or intelligence.  I think it's the fact that most men with that, are extremely successful men... which I am not because I was born with a very unfortunate foot disability, which made it nearly impossible to attain entry level work throughout most of my 20s.

How do the universal, articulated moral laws not fall into the subjective category? It seems that our moral systems would be, keeping in mind the above considerations, just happenstances of nature with no more necessity than the shape of our noses; that is to say, they would be merely arbitrary. Perhaps they could be objective (in the sense that these moral values aren’t just pulled from thin air as constructs of those who want to shape society to their will, but are real manifestations of the causal, evolutionary chain that got us here), but they could never be anything but the fluctuations of chance and luck — and that doesn’t seem to be a system worth upholding as “good” or even moral. This evolutionary psychology stuff never really makes sense in the end. Explain why we find a harsh desert, which is totally uninhabitable, to be beautiful and how we find an area that is totally fit to survive in to be absolutely repulsive (I have in mind something like a clean room with food and water but that is peppered with modern art)?

“Illness especially, may be a blessed forerunner of the individual’s conversion. Not only does it prevent him from realizing his desires; it even reduces his capacity for sin, his opportunities for vice. In that enforced detachment from evil, which is a Mercy of God, he has time to search himself, to appraise his life, to interpret it in terms of larger reality. He considers God, and, at that moment, there is a sense of duality, a confronting of personality with Divinity, a comparison of the facts of his life with the ideal from which he fell. The soul is forced to look inside itself, to inquire whether there is more peace in this suffering than in sinning. Once a sick man, in his passivity, begins to ask, “What is the purpose of my life? Why am I here?” the crisis has already begun. Conversion becomes possible the very moment a man ceases to blame God or life and begins to blame himself; by doing so, he becomes able to distinguish between his sinful barnacles and the ship of his soul. A crack has appeared in the armor of his egotism; now the sunlight of God’s grace can pour in. But until that happens, catastrophes can teach us nothing but despair.”

Also the parallels between tiamat, kingu, chaos, hedonism, femininity and the radical left are just unbelievably salient. Further, the parallels between abzu, masculinity, order, stoicism, responsibility and the historical or 'classical' western culture and evolution are just as outrageous.

Although i do not believe neitzsche when he said 'god is dead' granted there are still countless thinkers and believers currently revivifying him. Thinking of it in the sense of the Enuma Elich, through our lack of vigilance with marxism and the conditional precursors to power philosophies, we have naively ""killed"" our ""faith"" in abzu with our subtle acceptance of relativism and the upending of this structure in our education institutions.

In this way, i feel we can explain exactly why the fight against the SJW's has been so fierce and has lead to both your own lecture series and transformative material. As well as the overall revival of religion and the respect and dignity of classical western society. Although the battle is not over, it is clear that more people are awake now than ever before just as more are deceived in chaos than ever before.

I want to justify that far left thing for a bit, especially with the femininity. Women like to use social group bullying as their form of aggression, and this is clear with the lefts continual strategy in attacking outsiders. They do it to insiders as well but what we get is ""racist, bigot"" ect to drive society against the individual.

Further, the common leadership of leftist groups is either extremely femminized men or lesbians. By femminized men i mean men whose recorded testosterone is at the bottom 5% of all men such as Buzzfeed when they did a testosterone exam.

They cause chaos because the philosophies undo the axioms upon which most of the current order is built, or they disrupt the epistemic order by pushing politics ahead of the truth. This brings chaos as politics is truly relative and mostly zero sum and for politics, truth is secondary to power (to the degree that people do not pay attention ofcourse).

They encourage hedonism in their abandonment of responsibility in its association to rights. They take advantage of rights say to have a legal abortion and use this to justify a wantonly unrestrained sexuality or philosophically to convert sex to a type of transactional interaction.

The result of this is a kind of tyranny due to its fragility in the face of the truth or in the face of those who are attentive and will NOT hold back their speech. Much like the old god that killed tiamat, we have to have eyes and speak to conquer the left's currently insane chaos. We have to revivify this 'patriarchy' and love it for all the good it is so evidently and overwhelmingly responsible for.

And much like the term christian was derogatory before it became our self professed title of pride. We must restore to order the concept of the heirarchy and the concept of power (and so to the basic structures which god defined for us), whose distortions are the source of the chaos in our philosophical landscape and the negative 'associations' to the overwhelmingly good western 'patriarchy'. 

Very fascinating stuff. This explains why for the more mythologically inclined of us, The fight against the SJW's takes a borderline religious if not outright religious significance.

I mean, its no wonder after kingu lost he went to the underworld which is the metaphor for the place of chaos upon betrayal or collapse. 

And how fascinating:  SJW's want revenge so badly against western civilization and it is also Tiamat of chaos who sent kingu 'the brute' to get revenge for the death of abzu. Even in the bitterness of their resentment there is such a clear comparison. 

I could never find the right words for it, but this really does provide an excellent platform for exploration, insight and analysis. I feel like the words i couldnt have said are now spoken without pause. 

For most of my life, my biggest worry regarding the church was that the genius of the bible would remain unexposed and people would continue to get worse in their dismissals or ""intellectual hubris"" over its archetypic tales. That while its brilliance at the lower intellectual spectrum would continue to be revived, at the higher level, it will be further ignored.

But i feel as though my worries whilst real are not terribly likely granted that you exist and are speaking the truth which is so evidently reaching many. 

Thank you so much for this professor.

I do not think this leftist chaos is all bad if we can use this moment to grow in total. But its too early, feeling good is only right after a resounding victory. 

There is meaning however even in this terrible chaos and if my hunch is correct.
it is so that we precisely wake up and thank god for god.

This is one of the only chances we will get to restore the father to his rightful place in our hearts.

Geez man its no wonder single parenthood is so high. Economics is one thing but with the death of the father as a cultural concept, its no wonder single parenthood is so widespread.

While listening to your lectures, I can't help but smile from pure joy! I have never felt so motivated to exist! All of a sudden everything makes sense!

I wonder, did we forget all that, or is he our Moses?

Campbell might have this idea from Jung, I dont know. Do I Unterstand correctly, Peterson says the dragon represents chaos or the edge ?

I'm curious as to how his views and these philosophies interact. It's always been my understanding that the eastern philosophies ultimately send the message that to be liberated from suffering one must silence and eradicate the mind, and in doing so give up all will and control to - and merge with - brahman (essentially god; infinite, timeless, spaceless, existence; the set that includes all possible subsets) and in doing so become the best person they can be. Surrendering to and accepting the grace God would be a more Christian way of putting it.
This seems incompatible with the idea of taking charge and accepting responsibility and humanhood, bearing the cross, and being the master of your destiny and all that. At least they seem to be opposite tactics pointing at the same goal."
UgweiJDeQzBOcz9_eD94AaABAg,James Gillot,1511233299896,"@4:45 re Day and night.
Day = Illumination, the enlightened consciousness and positive incarnations of existence. Joy, love, etc. 
Night = 'distance from god' - ie. evil.  Revelations of the negative consequences inherently manifest in the process of creation. 

I think you are right (in refering to your previous talk) that there is a courageous element in god 'seeing it was good' . After each step of creation, the evening comes and is endured; look to the figures on the right of god in The Creation of Sun, The Moon and The Planets, the woeful figure almost completely hidden behind god. He represents the agony of the what is seen when we face away from the sun, a process that is as inevitable as the procession of our days and nights. 

To endure the night in revelation at the horrors implicit in creation, is hell. To see what is a necessary sacrifice for existence to be is torture. To see that it is good (to exist, rather than to not), in the face of that, is an act of faith and courage.

Which begs the question; if God had not 'seen it was good' could/would we exist at all? To see good, to have faith in 'humanity' underpins the ethos of morality codified in the bible, right from the very beginning. 

Kudos to you Dr Peterson. Your analysis is insightful, honest and courageous."

Anyway, I respect that state of the awareness - but not at that position in education. Do you aware of a tremendous influence you have on a younger population?

UgyinqLQlCtFwhTrjhx4AaABAg,Amos Wright,1508554904387,"""We don't know what a female politics looks like."" Indeed, we do. As an example, but not exclusively, Jews – especially non-Orthodox Jews – tend to live in matriarchal households and families. They also typically favor applying Marxist principles to other people and societies at large even when they do not practice those principles at home. Don't get angry. Simply look at the heritage of the Communist intellectuals from Marx to the present time (stop for a while at the Frankfurt School). The reason why the Left wishes to destroy families, and has been good at it, is that doing so becomes a rout. The more single mothers you get of any race, the more Statism you'll have. The more Statism you have, the more single mothers you'll get.

So, we know what it looks like. It looks like a boot stamping on a human face forever. Women HAD political power for the vast majority of our history — in the family, the band, the tribe, and even the hamlet, where female sentiments about sharing are entirely appropriate – and where the most relevant parts of our lives ensued. They did not have it politically on a larger scale because those sentiments are disastrous outside of the small groups in which most humans evolved, and most relationships are still had."

Like most places on earth India has been constantly at war.  War reduced the quantity of men relative to woman.  Indian wars tended to be wars for territory in order to have a larger tax base in order to live in greater opulence.   Because the wars typically did not  result in killing of woman and children there were always more women than men and so men did not have to compete for wives.  Rulers and fat cats had more than one wife, yet still there were enough women for all the men.   It was also the custom that the brother of a slain warrior would take his wife as one of his own.  And then, regardless of whether  a man could afford to raise a large brood of children he had a large brood anyway.  And those wars usually did not involve all the men of a kingdom but just the warrior caste.  Marriages in India were very much arranged and women usually had no or only little say in the matter, and none could marry out of caste.  Also, male dominence efforts could not cross caste lines.   India is a very different place."

To say that what distinguishes Campbell and Jung is that Jung emphasized acknowledging the shadow and Campbell ""talked about following your bliss"" really misrepresents the basic framework of Campbell's ideas. It's clearly laid out in Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces that the hero's journey involves many trying periods of grappling in depths of hell with the lowest and worst forms of human nature. Campbell does not say that ""just following your bliss will make everything ok"" (which is what Peterson implies very heavily around 1:45:00) He does say that following your bliss and passions will open up doors to you where you had at first only seen walls.

Is the distinction between Anti-hero and Villain if there should be one.  Is antagonist too loose to tie to either entirely? To me a Villain has always meant the classic antagonist, Like Hercules Vs Hades (yes disney)  where anti-hero to me was for starters the one I enjoy most thus is what I always call characters who accomplish heroic outcomes through nefarious means or if a side character do things like help the hero's plot apathetically or for selfish reasons> Along side the Tail end of the coin the antagonist who either has good intention, is playfully deviant opposed to actively malicious, even just villainous due to very relatable situations worthy of some pity and common human shortcomings that we know not everyone has the right combination of being & experience to overcome."

I have a problem with that, many things, that had been true for millions on years have recently become false !

First example I have is virginity in girls. It used to be, if a girls wasn't a virgin, you couldn't know if the kid would be years, you couldn't know if you were a cuckold. 

That's a serious issue evolutionary because you get that wrong and you end up not reproducing !

But today that is largely false, you can easily tell if your kid are really from you, you can tell if a non-virgin girl is pregnant from another man.

The important we place on virginity is no longer real. And that's true for tons of other things. 

They have become vestigial and they are no longer real. 

So that's a serious flaw in the the belief that because we've been shaped by it over evolutionary time that means it is real.

Same with any ideas from the bible or from culture. Really, all ideas are suspect and need to be considered on their own merit.


Just ""it's old therefore it is true"" is plain conservatism

Most college age people don't really care about what's happening in the Middle East, they only care about the Middle East as it relates to their own culture and their place in their own culture. They are still basically children!

By and large, first world feminists don't genuinely care about Islamic women. They don't even care about conservative women in their own country! They have an intellectual concern for women in other cultural contexts, but it's not a genuine emotional concern because they are still ""other"".

If women in the Middle East are stoned to death for adultery, it's intellectually horrible, but it doesn't scare them because it doesn't feel like it's something that exists in a community of ""people like me"" or ""my people"". 

It's not their hearth and home to worry about.

That's why they fixate on video games and the portrayal of women in media and things like that. It's stuff that they can relate to and it's stuff that might theoretically affect them personally, because it's ""people like me"""

UgzgucdEtqNnKSAST494AaABAg,Chris Hatton,1503284511038,"In this lecture Peterson kind of puts the concept of revelation into an evolutionary schema, though I am not sure he's aware that he's done so, and in doing so he removed from the idea of revelation any supernaturalness. Essentially, ""revelation"" in an evolutionary construct would be humans self consciously realizing what they need to do (ethics) in order to live well in community. So Moses spends all this time judging all of Israel's problems, and finally he goes up onto the mountain and he receives a revelation of the Law (i.e. an organized, hierarchically prioritized way of living in community). In Peterson view, the codification of the Law is not supernatural, rather Moses has just spent so much time judging Israel's problems that the internal organization and hierarchical prioritization of Israel's way of life finally ""dawns"" on him in a self-evident way, and so he codifies it. The Israelites in turn affirm it because the Law does indeed codify in an organized way the moral code under which they are  living, though until then they were living in this way unconsciously. Revelation, then, is the bringing to collective consciousness the internal order of the group. It's certainly a creative framework in which to think about revelation. The question I would ask Peterson would be, assuming this understanding of revelation is true, why Israel and why Jesus, and why the Bible. Even within these evolutionary presuppositions, one must still ask about the obvious staying power and superiority of the Biblical narrative in comparison to all the others, to speak about the order in which humans are to live, an order that transcends Israel to include every tongue, tribe and natiion, and one must ask why this order has had such a profound influence on the world. Why did Israel get it right, and Jesus perfect it, assuming that they did and he has? Even within an evolutionary framework does it not speak in favor of an internal active work of Being on humanity?"

I think this is occurring in western society because the rational and logic of an average person has far surpassed our capacity for wisdom. Most educated people have focused on improving intellectually for economic success but have done little to explore their own motivations and capacities. Since this needs to be remedied, how would we go about it? With religion like the dream that comes before articulation, what would a large scale articulation of religious truths look like? In other words, how would a philosophical revolution that introduces articulate wisdom from religions be implemented into greater society?"

However, this concept of the 'potential from which it emerges' troubles me.  We have to have an initial framework which underpins God, which cannot be, if we start from God creating everything in existance and who was there from the beginning of time.  So it would appear that we have to focus on time if we want to first try to understand God as a creator of everything.  Also, with regards power (I've yet to listen to this lecture, so these are my questions before I begin).  I feel preprogrammed to be attracted to men who have ""God like"" attributes of knowledge and from that, power.  It provides the explanation - from a female perspective of the popularity of 50 shades. It's giving up the power, control and choices we, as women, supposedly want.  Talking of God and on a lighter note, do you think that someone - probably with a narcassistic leaning - could identify as God and prove in a court of law that as such, they don't need to ascribe to the use of certain gender pronouns :)  I've adopted you as my online tutor - just completed psychology as a mature student with the OU and am now leaning towards philosophy post-grad, thanks, in part, to listening to you.

One example is the sentence he showed around 39:30 ""The Father employed the Son to generate habitable order out of chaos."" And he proceeded to explain that ""the older people use the younger people to generate creative ideas and renew the world"". However, this explanation fails because in Christian theology the Father and the Son are both eternally existing; one is not older than the other. So, if you take the terms Father and Son out of the Christian theological context and into the normal, everyday usage then I could see the conclusion but that means that Dr. Peterson is equivocating on the meanings of Father and Son."

This assumes that the unknown is playable as a game/games (and thus that the overarching virtues/rules for game playing still apply in the unknown). Put another way (since games are rule governed/structured), it assumes that the unknown/chaos actually can become ordered as you begin to engage with it (i.e. it can be understood). This would make sense as to why many myths tell you to confront the dragon. Even if it is dangerous, there is hope that you could actually succeed (i.e. makes sense out of/defeat the chaos). It appears to me that this is in keeping with the fundamental metaphysical affirmation that I see in the West (although, not exclusive to the west) from Plato to Christianity: reality is good (or at least can be), reality can be made sense of, you are better off with the truth than without it, and ultimately life is worth living."

A female who makes a wrong choice is removed from the gene pool,  those making the right choices remain. Therefore, these sexual choices are neither conscious nor arbitrary. As for there being twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors means that every successful reproducing male had two females to mate. Possible scenarios: A man with two wives, a man with a wife and mistress, or a man who divorces his wife when she's older and gets a second younger wife. None of those are female-preferred scenarios. In fact female-choice driven societies mean that LESS women breed than men -- Generation-X, where women had freedom to marry or not, to pursue careers instead of raise children or raise children later, to use birth control, to use abortion. Less of them had children than men of the same generation."

So when man's consciousness ""names,"" it is actually bringing into articulated awareness the various systems/a priori structures that human experience ""rides"" on so as to identify and measure animal-being against itself, thereby transcending animal-being, and/or recognizing itself as something essentially transcending animal-being. Thus, man is given ""dominion"" over the animals and recognizes himself as the imago dei creature toward which the evolutionary process has been working.

It may be that “God the Father” is an archetype of the innumerable winners of the untold scrambles to the top of an unknown number of competence pyramids through the uncounted generations. It may also be that a Designer put together human beings, not only with the ability to cope with life in a world that is real, like all living things, but also with the ability to comprehend Him.

I would say that anyone who thinks that the latter isn’t as lively a scientific possibility as the former is paying more attention to academic orthodoxy than to the current state of the science. (See Raymond Bergner, Illinois State University, Psychology, Faculty Member, “Intelligent Design: Maybe True, Maybe False, But Not Absurd.”)

In Jordan Peterson, I believe I see a man on a mission to help the western male, and specifically the civilization’s young men. A clinical psychologist who has seen their devastation first hand, who knows why, and who wants to do something about it (for which, count me a fan). But also a man who may be tailoring his message, perhaps unconsciously, more to Canadian young men than, say, the Texan young men who have yet to be convinced by the academy that theology is necessarily untrue.

At the same time we shouldn't let suffering consume us and turn us in something even worse than that. maybe there's no ""should"" or "" shouldn't"".

Could it be that by proving themselves highly competent in each game by playing fairly and not hiding any inadequacies behind underhand tactics, they prove themselves to be the most competent person to face the dragon. So the games are a test, and only by playing fairly do you (and everyone who is watching you) know how good you really are.

A massive symbolical meta-idea of everything wise, good and just, risen from the bottom up. Just as the idea of Satan is the distilled architypal idea of everything evil and unjust across history. 

and as Peterson says, it took humans forever to figure out those ideas, to abstract the architypes good and evil, and those ideas should not be just thrown away as stupid superstition.

edit: Or else we have to start all over again, start from scratch, dive into chaos and wonder at every individual conflict and ask ""which is good and evil?"". Our ancestors are screaming from beyond the grave, they sacrificed their lifes trying to abstract the ideas of good and evil for us, and they were not stupid, they were not naive.

I just had a quick question on a relationship of guilt to the ideas of the moral/ethical hierarchy that Professor Peterson kinda finishes around 38min: if this long, long evolutionary track has been able to drawn out either these archetypal truths or ethical rules to get along through realizations and emerging patterns in authority, does guilt simply mean that it is an innate response to failure to progress towards to top of the social structure that has been ingrained in you? 

This question is influenced partly by both Plato's ideas about Forms and C.S. Lewis's arguments of the Law of Human Nature, and I'm trying to see where Prof. Peterson is standing in relation to them and the arguments of them about each other."

Uggco3N_HEmXxHgCoAEC,Kendall Burks,1503284530136,"Here's an attempt at explaining the connection between the master of the meta-game and the hero who voluntarily confronts the chaotic unknown:  Any game or value hierarchy is built upon a PARTICULAR set of rules and limitations.  Because it is not open to the possibility of being anything other than what it is, it is a manifestation of ORDER.  Willingness to play the meta game requires faith that the CHAOS of other POSSIBLE games/hierarchies will manifest itself in a beneficial manner.  

In other words, the willingness to subjugate one's success in any particular game for one's success in the meta-game is the same thing as putting faith in the beneficial aspect of the unknown.  You are implicitly declaring that the order that defines your current game or value hierarchy is not the ultimate ground of being, despite the fact that such a declaration requires you to put faith in a reality that is beyond your control.  

I can cling to the game I am currently playing, assuming that it is the ultimate reality.  Or, I can put FAITH in all the games I could possibly play, assuming that the TRANSCENDENT elements which make up such games (divine spark of individual, benevolent will of God)  is the ultimate reality.

Ugi5HgJ0JS41k3gCoAEC,novusvoss,1503284530155,"In the very unlikely event that you'll read this, Dr. Peterson, I'd love to know your thoughts about the following:
I have a question or maybe an issue with the accuracy of the idea of sexual selection in humans as you present it.

Because in all your talks I never hear you mention the fact that men are selective towards women as well as vice versa, even tho that's only been true in more recent times. But as it gets financially more and more affordable to get around the world and through the perception of the internet, the modern man is aware of the seemingly endless choices he has in finding a mate during a lifetime.
In more ancient times a man was going to settle with almost any woman if only she was willing to lay with him because are you really going to be choosy in a village with 11 women around your age while there are 25 other men that share your ambitions? But nowadays that's just not the case anymore. The bar of expectations towards women has strongly risen and being hot alone just doesn't do the trick anymore. Maybe for sex adventures but when it comes to finding someone for long-term relationships I would make the case that men can be just as selective as women.

I'm aware that being higher up in the social hierarchy still increases the chances of passing down the DNA, that certainly hasn't changed, but maybe women nowadays have a less easy time finding the right someone as they used to. Maybe that would even shift the 2:1 ratio to 1:1 in the coming centuries?"

With recovery, the hippocampus might grow back, but the amygdala does not shrink back to its former size, so you end up (hopefully) with a person who is a lot more cautious about what actions he/she takes?

So JBP always mentions people high in neuroticism in a context that they are anxious or depressed most of the time, or react to certain situations inadequately. Soooo, does it mean that ppl that are high in trait neuroticism were just unlucky to be born high in this trait and doomed to suffer more than those who score low on this specific trait?! Can people high in neuroticism shift this trait closer to the balance or being even low on neuroticism? What these people can do about it throughout the life not to be depressed, live a life and not fall into the chaos?

UginKq6tIA6CNngCoAEC,SophiaCycles,1503284542187,"This is a wonderful talk but I must correct Dr. Peterson on Joseph Campbell. He has mentioned before that Campbell took most of his ideas from Jung. This statement is not correct. Campbell was influenced much more by the work of Adolf Bastian and his theory of the Elementargedanke (Bastian was a great influence on Jung as well).  Other important influences on Campbell's work include Heinrich Zimmer and Oswald Spengler. Aside from these thinkers, there are the usual suspects --- Schopenhauer, Nietzsche etc. Campbell was a phenomenal thinker and to this day there is no one, in my view, who has understood the work of James Joyce better (his ""Skeleton Key to Finnegan's Wake"" is an indispensable guide to that work, for example.)  Campbell's work is vast and difficult and cannot be reduced to the ""Follow your Bliss"" line that is often quoted out of context. Like Peterson's talks, Campbell's work must be read in its entirety to be understood.  He did share many of the conclusions that Jung came to (they were reading and considering the same thinkers after all) but it is not correct to say that he ""mostly distilled Jung.""  What Campbell did was to popularize some of the very ideas that Peterson is taking on today. Both are very valuable and younger people who may not have encountered Campbell and appreciate Peterson, would mostly likely find  Campbell's work of interest as well."

I'm less sure on this but I was also thinking that maybe the reason for that is because being able to vanquish problems and take advantage of opportunity at the same time is a mutually beneficial strategy. It's like if you quell the chaos generally speaking everybody wins, except maybe whoever happens to be on the side of chaos in the particular instance you're considering.

This figure (Christ) is literally the door to the next level of consciousness. Its why its termed a gift because we as humans cannot do that ,only God could bring that about. All he (God/reality) is asking is that you repent of your wickedness (lower consciousness) and accept the gift (higher consciousness)

Perhaps the innate yearning that they feel at a deep level that the barbarians are real men, is a part of it.  But at a simpler level, their ideology precludes discussion, as does the ideology of ISIS and other forms of radical Islam.  The only two options at that point are what ISIS demands, capitulation or war.  For the SJW's our society must capitulate or they will use violence.  It is the same stark mode of thinking, so there is a natural affinity.  

And, to the extent that SJW's have enough mental capacity to formulate an end-game on their own, the outcome is the destruction of western society, especially personal freedom.  (I don't think they have thought that one through from their own personal perspective)  The goal of radical Islam is the world wide Caliphate by force, the defacto destruction of the western civilization and personal freedom.

I think that once darwinian theories of evolution took hold, the public dream sort of started to die a little bit which is why so quickly after darwinian theory was introduced Marxism took hold. What happens when you don't dream? You start to go a little insane. The world takes on a nightmarish quality because you literally begin to dream while you are awake. I think that by taking away much religion much Christianity and taking away the public dream you have put Society into a certain state that happens when you are withheld from REM sleep.

Richard Carrier does a great job of taking that apart a bit in his talk ""Christianity without Jesus.""
If you look at it from the perspective that some things in the Bible can be simple human banter and not all are condensed myths stuffed with wisdom accumulated over our whole evolutionary timespan then you don't have to break your head about decyphering meaning from statemens such as these.

UgiWdbmEk5eplHgCoAEC,myszone,1503284582740,"At 22:00 , I think you say something wrong. If an average woman that reproduces had one child, then the size of population would be halved in each generation. You probably meant to say that average woman has two children. In a stable population an average man would also have two children, but an average man who reproduces would have more than two children. An average woman that reproduces would also have more than two children, but less then average man that reproduces.

I find it interesting to think about how to present this idea in a way that would make intuitive sense to most people. I'd try something like that:

Imagine a population. It has the same number of men and women, and there are some children in this population. The men and women have the same average number of children, since in both cases it's the number of children divided by the number of men or women. Now, remove from this population all the people who have no children. You're going to remove a relatively small of women, but a much higher number of men. Now, the average number of children of a men that has at least one child, is the number of children divided by men remaining, and similarly for women. But there are more women remaining than men! So the average number of offspring of women who have at least one child is lower than the average number of offspring of men who have at least one child! If you compound this effect over generations, you can end up in a situation in which everyone in the population has on average twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors."

Put yourself on that damn edge and make yourself into something!

You can retreat into comfort in the modern world, and that is a problem.  One of the pathologies or problems of being relatively wealthy, if you’re a parent, is that you cannot provide your children with necessity.  And that’s a big problem because they need necessity to call them into being.  If you don’t have a lot of material resources and your children ask you for something, you can say ‘No’ because no is the answer.  But if you can say ‘Yes’ then it’s really hard to say no because you’re just being arbitrary.  It’s like Kierkegaard said ‘There will come a time when we have so much security and comfort that what we will want more than anything else is deprivation and challenge’.”

UgjKFAFF28irXHgCoAEC,EthnoCentrist,1503284582827,"Yah, except God didn't create the universe and doesn't exist. We can talk about hypothetical authority and its esoteric meaning all day; doesn't make it real.

As Christopher Hitchens put it: If there was a deity that was responsible for not just the creation of the universe, but whom was busily engineering the very laborious production of life on Earth, it still wouldn't prove that he cared about us. Did God created the animals too? Well 99.999% of ALL life to ever have lived has gone extinct. And we nearly joined them on the African Savannah. Its believed the number of humans dwindled from civilisation size to the size of a few thousand people. And thats our exodus story; and we don't how we lived because there is no superstitious story, there is no religious narrative around it, but somehow they made it off the Savannah too cooler latitude. Thats how close it got! And you have to believe that all of this, mass extinction and randomness and suffering is the will of a being. You are absolutely free to believe that if you wish.And that all of this should happen, so that we could be today to be good Christians. Its extraordinarily arrogant claim.

No doubt Christianity affected our values as Peterson points out many times in this series and maps of meaning. But its nothing compared to the struggle undertaken by men to push back against theological nutcases whom wanted to impose their version of scripture on us. Christianity has been an impediment to western morality. Be womens rights or the rights of black men, the church has opposed progress EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Confucius said, thousands of years before Jesus even is believed to have existed that we should treat others how we would like to be treated ourselves. 

Morality is innate in humans - and some animals. There are countless videos of Gorillas looking after lion cubs - they weren't taught to do this, they just do. Life likes to help life. Christians want to claim that as a Christian virtue - which it isn't. A fundamentalist Christian would step over a suffering non believer like me and be on his way. If you have to distance yourself from the fundamentalists of your religion(The WBC, creationists etc) than there is probably something wrong with the fundamentals of your religion. 

No doubt, the Peterson fanboys will hate on me for missing the alleged profundity of the bible and Christian teaching. But hey, my own free mind has an opinion that differs and although I am willing to change it, nuanced Christians like Peterson don't do much for me. In fact, had Christians been as nuanced as Peterson from day dot, I'd probably have nothing against the church. But they killed to many free thinkers for simply not believing as they did. To many gays. To long women's right were held back by religions hatred for the womens birth canal - I don't share that hatred. 

Its very hard to read the texts and not recognise the yearning it has(in all monotheism's) for this world to come to an end. It can't wait, it cannot wait for this life to be over. Religion makes nice people, say and do stupid things. Handed a small child, is it your first thought to think ""beautiful, almost perfect, now hand me the sharp stone, so that I may cut the genitalia and do the work of the lord""... NO. Its nor moral to cut penis'. Its not moral to lie to children. To terrify them with images of hell."

I'm not sure how literal Dr. Peterson is trying to be here but technically I don't think this is correct. What the above means is that if you follow your line back and I follow my line back until we hit a shared ancestor, that ancestor will probably be male. But both of us will have an equal number of males and females in our respective lines (it always takes one male and one female to produce a child).

UgjavpSVUR7u8HgCoAEC,Daedalus 29z,1503284582948,"I realized that most of us watching this (and certainly the vast majority of the audience of the talk) have heard these exact ideas from Dr. Peterson before.  And yet, we keep coming back.  I've thought about that a bit and I think there's a few reasons for it:  
A.) These are complex ideas that attract critical thinkers, and its almost an addiction to continue to critically think about them- to continue striving toward the highest ideal of truth.  
B.) These are complex ideas that require analysis from multiple viewpoints in order to be effectively understood.  It's the nature of critical thinking to bombard an idea with different criticisms, the strongest criticisms one can muster, to see if the idea stands. And Peterson is doing this whenever he attacks a problem from multiple perspectives: biblical, psychological, evolutionary, even political when relevant.  It teaches one how to think most effectively, picking out the strongest elements of an idea until it stands as powerfully as it can.  You don't really understand something until you can explain it or write it in simple terms.  And it takes multiple iterations of a complex idea to reach that point.  
C.) I also think, and this is the one I haven't quite figured out, there is a religious element, you could call it religious ideation, to hearing the same ideas multiple times from multiple perspectives. There are so many parallels for this in religious history. For example, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John telling the nearly identical story from multiple perspectives.  Or the tradition of going to church every Sunday and hearing the same scriptures repeated, and then sermonized (explained) in practical terms week after week after week.  Or more generally, the cyclical nature of church tradition, in that the same messages are conveyed at certain parts of the year, or when two people are married, or when a person dies.  Doing the same thing slightly differently is the 'order' part of us.  It's the tradition.  It's the culture.  Its what reinforces what we already know, and gives us ground to stand on when we go out to confront the unknown.  We might not know what we're confronting, but we have built our house upon the rock.  And when we venture forth out into the world, we venture forth from a position of strength.  

So, for many of us, myself included, who are seeking greater meaning and have struggled with the ""new atheist"" view of Christianity until recently, Dr. Peterson gives us better and better iterative designs to build that ultimate house in our minds from which to venture forth into the world.  It is as he says, that we can longer afford not to be consciously aware of these ideas and their importance, for the future of our very being."

UghRAxEqWL2j33gCoAEC,Borna Vranković,1503284592096,"I have an idea about why SJWism is more prevalent among women. 

I think it has to do with testosterone, and maybe some other hormones as well, but sticking with testosterone is fine for the purposes of this comment. I think Peterson is right when he says that people more or less vote their temperament. And for that reason women are more likely to want everyone to have equal amount of resources, for resources provide security that is necessary for fulfillment of their reproductive role. As with most political philosophies/ideologies, they start with individual inclinations and proclivities and then get generalized as a political ideology develops further, so from personal preference -> political ideology that is essentially personal preference generalized to all people and then imposed through politics.

Now we come to the question of SJW men, and leftist men more broadly. There is some research that testosterone levels correlate with political inclinations, that is, men with higher levels of testosterone tend to vote right, while men with lesser levels of testosterone tend to vote left. Higher levels of testosterone make a man more aggressive, confident, brave, etc., which makes him more confident in his ability to acquire resources and rise in the dominance hierarchy which would make him more attractive to women and increase his chances of leaving an offspring -> so it is in his best interest (as far as reproduction goes) to favor a more meritocratic system in which he can rise above other men in the social landscape. He also tends to favor socially conservative opinions (monogamy, marriage, etc.) because they guarantee him at least one woman as long as he isn’t a complete loser.

Men with lesser levels of testosterone on the other hand, who aren’t so confident in their ability to fight for resources would favor a system that makes all men equal so that other men can’t rise above them in the social hierarchy, for that would lower their chances of leaving an offspring and that manifests itself through the SJW desire to take down the alpha male perfectly.  So those men align with women because they both need resources they can’t acquire themselves to increase their chances of leaving an offspring. I also read that married women tend to vote conservative which would fall perfectly in line with this, for they get nothing from sharing the resources they already possess. There is also anecdotal evidence (and maybe some research too, I don’t know) that more attractive women tend to fall more on the conservative side of the political spectrum, for men value physical appearance in women, and hot women have better chances of securing a partner that is going to provide resources for them relative to unattractive women. You just have to take a look at a typical feminist to see what I’m talking about here. Or just look at prominent YouTube feminists in comparison to prominent YouTube anti feminists and girls that fall more to the right side of the political spectrum.

It would also explain libertarians who are fiscally conservative and socially liberal and Haidt said they typically have the most masculine characteristics and even jokingly referenced Baron Cohen’s research into the relationship between autism and testosterone. And it would make sense, because libertarians favor highly meritocratic systems with socially liberal policies and that allows them to have all their wealth to themselves with harems of women flocking to them because of it. Think along the lines of Genghis Khan and people like that. They don’t give a shit about marriage and monogamy because they “know” masses of women will fall in line to mate with them and therefore their best strategy is to impregnate them all and take care of as much of them as they can, like silverback gorillas. Which is funny because women also like a little bit of grey hair on their man too.

The only thing that doesn’t quite make sense is why would liberal men be inclined to socially liberal views and open sexuality, but it might just be the case that a sexually open social structure without a male hierarchy would give them a better chance of propagating their genes than even a socially conservative structure where all men are equal because men with more testosterone would certainly have more luck with winning over a long term mate than some weaker and more timid male. Think about it, a loser has a higher chance of sticking it in an orgy than impressing a girl over a longer period where she doesn’t put out easily, and libertarian men have a great chance no matter the setting.

I think I more or less figured it out, now I just need to wait for some more research to see if it holds up and what adjustments need to be made to this theory."

They also determined that the universe was created suddenly out of something very, very small (singularity). They calculated the universe to be 15.35 Billion years old. That was hundreds of years before the advent of modern science. Even Einstein thought that the universe is eternal and static.

UggOYMtEzXCJvngCoAEC,De Mondige The Vocal One,1503284592166,"This is a great lecture. It nicely condenses everything I've seen of Jordan Peterson into one, which makes it a lot easier to learn from instead of watching all videos again.

The whole idea of ""dominance"" hierarchies and the Piagetian games really do let you reflect on it. I do not know how familiar Dr. Peterson is with evolutionary game theory, but I think it is the missing piece of the puzzle that would make it even more perfect, solid. 

The basis of evolutionary game theory is firstly, that the game has two agents who can make a choice and a priori the agents are ignorant about the other agent's choice. Secondly, there are two options: one can choose to Cooperate (C), or one can choose to Defect (D) (equivalent with deceit in the psychological sense). Thirdly, the results of the game (of the first actor's point of view) are the combinations of those options: C-C which is called the Reward (R), C-D which is called the Sucker's Payoff (S), D-C which is called the Temptation (T) and D-D which is called the Punishment (P). Fourthly, the end result of the game is the ESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) or the Nash equilibrium, meaning that the ESS is the strategy that yields the highest possible fitness and thus, an invader who has a different strategy is not capable to achieve a higher fitness.

When T > R > P > S, then you have something called the Prisoner's Dilemma and the ESS is to always defect even though it would be more optimal to all cooperate (but from the definition we know that a invader who defects would achieve a higher fitness because T > R and takes over the whole population). The Prisoner's Dilemma was something that really kept bugging scientists (because often it is the case the T > R and P > S), it is more a paradox than a dilemma. Because in reality we see a lot of cooperation rather than defection.

The issue is that defection is only an ESS if it is one game and if the other agent doesn't remember your previous choice. Once it is iterative, it is not. The ESS would be a ""Pavlov"" strategy: one starts nice (cooperative), but changes strategy when duped (retaliation), then copies the other's strategy, realize it gives a lower pay-off, forgive the other and resume cooperation (also called Win-Stay-Lose-Shift):
Pavlov agent 1: C, C, C, D, D, C, C, C,...
Pavlov agent 2: C, C, C, C, D, C, C, C,...

This is EXACTLY what Piaget is saying: one should play the game to be victorious once but to be victorious over an infinite number of games. [Infinite because an invader that knows how many games you will play, will defect in the very last game and have a higher fitness. This invader can be replaced by the next invader who will defect in the second-last game and so on until the ESS is defect.] This is the basis of reciprocal altruism.

The literature is more vast than that (what if you could punish defectors, what if you build conditionality to access the game, etc.). The point is that evolutionary game theory corroborates the insights of Piaget and of Dr. Peterson in terms of ""dominance"" hierarchies."

Peterson keeps asserting ideas about God that have no basis in the text he's allegedly analyzing, and which fit quite well into the simple materialist and deterministic world view. Morality is based solely and completely on biology. (Which is convenient if you want to ignore it and you can get away with it). The idea of God is just an phantom dreamt up by primates to articulate a deeper meaning to millennia of organisms fighting to duplicate their DNA.
It works quite nicely; as long as you don't actually LOOK at the text, or look at what people in the Abrahamic religions actually believe about God. There is no basis in the text whatsoever that God is anything but a transcendent figure. But that is a bit inconvenient to the theory that God is just the cleverest monkey that got to the top of the pyramid - so we won't talk about it.

It must take much courage to do all that publically.  So with great humility I beg to differ on one important point...

He seems to hold the view that humanity or the Israelites collectively thought up the Old Testament law and moral code, rather than a living God giving it to them (1:30:00). That they were already acting out the rules before they wrote them down. But Jordan…

Many of the 10 commandments (edit: law of Moses) were revolutionary in the cultural context they were given, such as the idea of treating slaves and beasts of burden well, like giving them a day off a week, or the hope of redemption from slavery.

There Israelites were given strict instructions to leave the practices of the Egyptians behind, and not to intermingle with the people of the land they were moving into, so they (the Israelites) would not be contaminated with their way of life. The Israelites were to be separate for God. They were not looking to incorporate the best the foreigners had to offer.

The Israelites rebelled against the law continuously. It was God's impossible standard given to them in order to expose their sin. It was not a standard they could ever hope to meet, or would want to impose on themselves. They were not already living these laws out before they were written down in stone.

(God is not just the evolution of an idea. God is separate to creation, sustains creation, and chooses to intervene in ways we can perceive)"

1.Subjective Value is nihilistic, makes man God and denies the authority of the Bible.

2. Libertarianism promotes a laissez-faire policy of the state toward the market. The principle of opportunity cost precludes the idea of neutrality. There is no neutrality in this world. You are either with or against. Mat. 12: 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

3. Hierarchy and Authority is grounded in the family. Every argument Libertarians make against Statism and Slavery can all equally apply to the human family. Moreover, there is a Government among the unfallen angels in Scripture. Government is not a result of sin.

4. Both Biology(Haplogroups) and Scripture(Rom. 9:1-3, Rom. 11[Jews, Gentiles]) denotes
collective identities not merely individuals.

5. Capitalism is Darwinism pace Darwin’s emphasis on Competition which he alludes to in Origen of Species in discussion of Herbert Spencer.

6. Ayn Rand was an Inspiration to the Church of Satan:
http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php

7. The Libertarian distinction between Ethics and Economics is meaningless.

8. Private Property just means Individual Sovereignty/Satanism; Judges 17:5 every man did what was right in his own eyes.

9. The Bible’s prohibition against Usury is a prima facie denial of the entire system of Capitalism and the modern Banking industry. John Calvin’s distinction between Business loans and charity is refuted by Neh. 5.

10. Since the Bible forbids usury it ipso facto forbids the Gold Standard

11. The rich are generally demonized as immoral people in the Bible. Mark 10:25 “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

12. Free Trade is a method used by the Satanic rich to make money for themselves at the expense of their countrymen’s poverty and misery.

13. The Economic consequences of letting people do what they want are disastrous in the light of comparative advantage and opportunity cost. The financial and physical strength of our people is wasted on their atheist and nihilistic pursuits such as sports, abortions, STDs, degenerate entertainment etc.

14. Libertarian Christians say sins are not crimes necessarily. They will say the sin is a crime only if the OT law demands a penalty, but then they turn around and say the penalties are ceremonial: i.e. Jubilee-remittance of debt, is ceremonial. They use sophistry to make the law powerless and meaningless. Disgusting!

15. The US Constitution is betrayal to the Protestant Solemn League and Covenant, and is Satanic and Counter Reformation. Article 6 clause 3 of the US Constitution:

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.”

""Who is the son of perdition?""
http://www.gotquestions.org/son-of-perdition.html

quote

Answer: The title “son of perdition” is used twice in the New Testament, first in John 17:12 and again in 2 Thessalonians 2:3. The phrase simply means “man doomed to destruction” and is not reserved for any one individual. In fact, there are two people to which the title “son of perdition” is applied. In context, John 17:12 is referring to Judas Iscariot, while 2 Thessalonians 2:3 is referring to the “man of lawlessness”—the Antichrist—who will appear in the end times before Christ’s return.

The word perdition means “eternal damnation” or “utter destruction.” It can also be used as a synonym for hell. When a person is called “son of perdition,” the connotation is that of a person in an unredeemable state, someone who is already damned while he is still alive. Jesus mentions the “son of perdition” in His high priestly prayer in John 17. While praying to the Father for His disciples, Jesus mentions that He “protected them and kept them safe” and that none of them were lost except the “son of perdition,” that is, the one who was already in a damned state. The fact that the phrase is used again to describe the Antichrist shows us that forgiveness was not planned for Judas. God could have saved Judas—moved his heart to repentance—but He chose not to. He was indeed “doomed to destruction.”

A good picture of a person who is a “son of perdition” appears in Hebrews 6:4–8, which describes a person who, like Judas, has experienced a certain closeness to God and has a good understanding of salvation, but then denies it. Instead of bearing good fruit, he bears “thorns and thistles.” This is a person who sees the path to salvation, which is trusting in God’s grace to cover sin (Ephesians 2:8–9), and instead either flatly denies the existence of God or denies God’s gift of salvation, preferring to pay his own debt. Judas chose the second path, punishing himself by suicide instead of accepting grace.

""The bloody postmodernists will tell you that fishing is a linguistic power game played by those in the privileged identity group to justify their oppressive system. Think again BUCKO! It's really a socially negotiated game you play with the underworld to get it spit back out your dead father. Here, let me give you an example. I went fishing one day with my son when he was very young. We woke up early, roughly speaking, and made our way over to the local incomprehensible hand gesture pond. We went out on a raft into the middle of the pond and set up our fishing poles, roughly speaking. I was reading some fascinating Piaget when my son, the little goblin, shoved a, a spastic, almost seizure-esque hand gesture MARIONETTE into my face. I turned to him and I was like ""What the hell is a bloody marionette doing on my damn boat?"" and I chucked it into the depths of the underworld, roughly speaking, where it collapsed into the chaotic potential from which it emerged. Well, Julian was pretty upset about all this and complained to his mum, who robbed him of his burden by comforting him. It's not obvious which of us loved him more in that instance.
Anyways, we were sitting in the boat when a fisherman passes by and, and violent, aggressive cursing in ASL turns to me and asks ""Is that boat safe?"" I looked at him and I just couldn't believe it! It was Karl Bloody Marx! I threw my copy of Piaget at the little gremlin and grabbed him by his hair. ""IF I WANTED TO BE SAFE I'D STAY HOME WITH MY MUM!"" I shouted, popping him in the bloody nose. ""But, what about the oppression of the bourgeoisie?"" He shrieked, in the shrill whine of the broken-nosed. ""Read something about the bloody Pareto Distribution!"" I shouted at him, as I slew him with the sword I keep at my side at all times for just such a purpose. And, would you know it, gold poured out of his bloody bloody corpse, roughly speaking! I couldn't believe it! But what could I spend it on? I've got so much damn privilege I don't know what to do about it! Plus, Canada's socialized medicine means I'll live for bloody ever! I decided to toss it into the pond, roughly speaking dislocates wrist and a bloody WHALE popped out of the depths and spat a bald man onto my boat, next to Julian. Well, I was bloody floored. We took the man home, and cleaned him up. It turned out to be JOE BLOODY ROGAN! And that's NO JOKE! Anyways, that's how Joe and I met and decided to do our first podcast.

UgjPK5M2KFbvcXgCoAEC,Kon Berner,1503284646417,"Still bugs me this idea that there are traits that can make a human good at climbing every possible dominance hierarchy. Are general intelligence and conscientiousness selected for in human evolution? I think this must be the case, but in game theory in respect to evolution, there are mixed strategies e.g. ""cheating"" that can pay off, and cheating may be antithetical to certain kinds of cognitive ability, but very much compatible with other kinds. I also think that, even on the ""positive side"" there can be tension between traits that can make them somewhat antithetical, and this includes general intelligence. If so, then there is no ""one type of hero"", but there may be various types.

What useful trait could be incompatible with general intelligence? For example, logic can lead to dualistic thinking, which can be good for some tasks but bad for spiritual insight and happiness. Consider this from the Tao Te Ching:

The supreme good is like water,
which nourishes all things without trying to.
It is content with the low places that people disdain.
Thus it is like the Tao.

In dwelling, live close to the ground.
In thinking, keep to the simple.
In conflict, be fair and generous.
In governing, don't try to control.
In work, do what you enjoy.
In family life, be completely present.

When you are content to be simply yourself
and don't compare or compete,
everybody will respect you.


We can see the idea that attempting to climb the hierarchy can itself be in conflict with peace and happiness. Perhaps women are drawn to this trait in some cases also, and some kinds of high intelligence can be in conflict with it. I have noticed that high intelligence but arrogant people can be very unattractive to women, so this is a very, very complex issue. Bottom line is that there may be a level of consciousness that starts to realize the the entire idea of climbing dominance hierarchies is not the most harmonious state. This doesn't mean that there are not spiritual hierarchies, which are no way about dominance, could not still be present. Just as humans will eventually overcome war, the overcoming of struggling for dominance may also become evolved beyond.

One can reply, ""well, that is real intelligence then"". OK, fair enough but, again, someone who is intelligent in the sense of being good at spreading his seed like Genghis Khan did, may never be able to be the same person who is good at spreading it through being a deeply spiritual being. Maybe better to say that the types of heroes that are possible depend on the overall level of evolution of consciousness."

Such a view of the Godhead, is considered by the only God (who's name is Jesus) of the Old and New Covenant, an anathema, abomination, what God would expect from the masters of the mystery religions of their fellowship with the Devil himself and thus I kindly ask Mr. Peterson, please consider the following verses below, for God/Jesus despises philosophy for it's considered by Jesus to be a paragon example of supreme vain foolishness while men with scales on their eyes call it 'wisdom'. It's the enemy of the Scriptures and to filter the Scriptures through a philosophical sieve is why He never gave authority to the non born again believer to explain the spiritual comprehension of the Holy Bible for simply, until they are born again, they do not have the spiritual keys to unlock what Jesus actually was teaching; 

Col 2:8 BEWARE lest ANY MAN (or WOMAN EVEN) SPOIL YOU through PHILOSOPHY and VAIN DECEIT (what the Devil taught mankind for he fell because of vanity), after the TRADITION OF MEN (who followed the Devi's false wisdom), after the rudiments of the world, and not after the Christ. 
Col 2:9 For in HIM (aka JESUS aka GOD) dwelleth ALL the FULNESS of the Godhead BODILY.* 

Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; (that He indeed does exist) 
Rom 1:19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 
Rom 1:20 For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
Rom 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 
Rom 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
Rom 1:23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. (a.k.a. the philosophical religion of ""Evolution"", quite old) 
Rom 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 
Rom 1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 
Rom 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
Rom 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 
Rom 1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 
Rom 1:29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
Rom 1:30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
Rom 1:31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 
Rom 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. 

Thus in first level summary, as men grew more conceited over their self-styled knowledge motivated by willfully ignoring the knowledge of God to choose the false wisdom of God's nemesis instead, they plunged deeper into willful ignorance and cretin nonsense. These two things always characterize those who reject the knowledge of God—they become blind to to their own insufferable conceit and abysmal ignorance at the same time as a result of willfully losing the capacity to see while convincing themselves they can see crystal clearly and guide others correctly which the Creator Himself has not given the Scriptural keys to comprehend in the first place."

So, he is making zombies of sleep. Making uses and thieves. Murders and deviants. Is there even a way to apparently behave as in such a manner?

I just like how these quotes and weirdos often develop these notions not fro outside or inside, but on massive murders and experienements and ignore any contrary evidence, because they ignore the life in which the house dies, but its them that kill the house, this is so much of the world.. Who would want to be part of your teachings. They are absurd, I don't understand why you are mixing and teaching this nonsense. Destruction reason and rational, and sciences by the command of money, and psychological sorcerers.

However, his basic theology seems to be like the Episcopal Church and other Mainline Denominations.  To take a more metaphorical and symbolic emphasis on scripture instead of a literal focus. 

And while I'm a big supporter in some ways of a more liberal theology to a point (so long as it doesn't contradict or deny the Nicene Creed) I'm not so sure the majority of Peterson's fanbase would be. I could be off base here, but I do generally get the sense that a good chunk of Jordan's fans are not only anti-SJW, but want to also keep the traditional ethics of Christianity while trying to ditch some of the more supernatural elements. Don't think you can have either without the other to prop it up. 

Again though for anyone who likes this approach to Christian theology I highly recommend  Keith Ward as well as progressive Christianity in general. Peterson's approach is honestly similar to me with a albeit psychoanalyze flare to it."

Why do you believe in God? Most of your videos show that you are scientifically minded and accept evolution as the basis of how humans arose from earlier species (although evolution doesn't explain how or why life started). But what I don't understand is why or how you bring God into the equation. Is it for any of the reasons below?

1) How you were brought up as a child and can't and won't get rid of the belief in God
2) Some sort of personal experience that led you to him
3) The idea of pre-big bang or the very first life bothers you so much that you need a prime mover to account for it
4) You believe in heaven and hell and do not want to go to hell
5) You lose someone important to you and you can't fathom the idea that they may just not exist outside their physical body anymore

A note on Serotonin/5HT: While it relates to dominance, it may be better characterized as a general marker of environmental opportunity. This is perhaps best evinced by its role in sponges, which lack a proper nervous system but use this chemical a the primary signal that determines the contraction of pores. (When the surrounding water is rich in nutrients, the pores contract, trapping caught ""food"" and limiting new intake.) 

The most concerning aspect of the presented notion of 5HT is that it is the target of third-wave antidepressants. This is not so obvious from the research, despite the pamphlets from pharmaceutical companies. There is substantial evidence that the SSRI function is only active at the highest clinical doses (>50mg/qd). Other forwarded hypotheses reveal the possibility of upregulating endogenous neuroprotective steroids (e.g., allopregnanolone). This mechanism is present at the common clinical doses and is shared by a broad variety of traditional antidepressants as well as less canonical drugs (e.g., St John's Wort)."

Thank you for setting that record straight!--from an orthodox Catholic.

Not that I'm 100% certain in every case where in Holy Scripture literal history begins and visionary revelations end, and vice versa, but it's pretty clear that Genesis 1-3 and the Apocalypse are explanatory visions; but I have no doubt that the main narrative of the OT, the Gospels, and Acts are literal events. That's not for a moment to say that this sacred history isn't itself symbolic, revealing the economy of God's plan of salvation. 
The Church interprets Scripture in these main four senses (all simultaneously when possible): 

1.) Literal/Historical

And Mystical: 
2.) Allegorical (how it prefigures/reveals/relates to Christ)
3.) Moral (for our instruction of how we should live), and 
4.) Anagogical (how it relates to Heaven/eternal life)"

UgiGrpQB1nzzxXgCoAEC,Luis F.R.,1503284682604,"At 25:00. I have a good amount of questions about that. How would the selection for IQ and Conscientiousness account for the somewhat universal meme of women falling for the 'bad boy', why are not so much known for their intelligence nor conscientiousness. The film Idiocracy comes to mind immediately, but more than that the general scheme of what we have in THE RED PILL today for example. The latter raises the issue that women only ever settle down with the sort of BETA-male provider who is reliable while at the same time going after the 'bad boy' to have children with, or sexual liaisons with. Aren't they contradictory in some ways?"

UggCRbas3-Q6gHgCoAEC,Matt Broadhurst,1503284682816,"there's part of me that's slightly frustrated, since these earliest stories are retreading things Peterson has explained in his Maps of Meaning lectures multiple times (primarily the mythic age stories from Genesis to Tower of Babel). I'm much more interested in the later stories specifically because they've been the least discussed and because they're arguably the most relevant or ""evolved"" (given that Christianity is iteratively built upon the Mesopetamian, Egyptian, and Jewish faiths) and we may not even possibly get to them. But I'm still very eager to see this through since it's a comprehensive look at the Bible specifically from start to finish."
