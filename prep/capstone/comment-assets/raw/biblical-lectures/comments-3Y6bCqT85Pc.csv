Ugwxv-3wl0x_7dkP8jp4AaABAg,Bobbly Wobbly,1534215860244,"If Christianity is not what it is accepted to be which many reports about rejection and destruction or exclusion of female gospels and the poor approach of Christianity towards women, I don't think it's right to conflate the diminution of Christianity and therefore the attack on masculine values with the post-modernist etc.. ideas. They may have occurred at the same time but I can't see how given the limitations placed upon women by the exclusion in the pantheon that the two are directly connected. Perhaps the war on the male mentality is a natural but obviously less than ideal symptom but I am not sure it's right to state that religion's diminution is directly responsible and as such that religion is the answer. Ultimately it's a conception of the universe which predicates a belief in not just the unproven but also the illogical and irrational. It may have value in itself as a lifestyle/psychological text but God is still lingering and in that sense it can't be given too much power, but I agree that unchecked opposite swing might not be good either and the attack on the all things male is not culturally beneficial. As he says ""I don't know"" It's problematic I suppose because then if one is dealing with a good and evil diametric then the last thing we need is to identify those opposites as male female oppositions. I am sure I am looking at this simplistically and that ultimately the good is reason buttressed by whatever (faith, emotion?) and the bad is intolerance or despotism. Both sides and have been capable of both which makes it a bit more complicated. Perhaps it's just about intelligence vs stupidity. Maturity vs irresponsibility. The old Biblical go to values. I suppose they are culturally timeless and repeated throughout the ages which is why the whole Christian God thing irks me a bit, it demonstrates a lack of perspective and historical awareness. Functionally beneficial though I don't doubt."

2) What he means by belief or God, etc. are almost definitely completely different to everybody elses.

Ugw-dDeWVSp2hBFYGNV4AaABAg,Brain Phelps,1529550267124,"i kinda think Jordan is shoehorning in this sacrificing of the son to represent giving up something u love in order to grow.  A son does not represent a thing that must be given up for growth.  A son is sacrifice, pain, it is a thing you must work very hard to nurture.  If this is meant to represent delaying gratification, Abraham would have been asked to give up a lover or a house, or something or other, but definitely not a son."

But I would contend that  neither the creation story, Noah, Moses, or Abraham, nor the prophecies of Christ, the life of Christ or his sacrificial death establish the true wonder and power of the God Story. Resurrection is the essential hook, as a physical event,  upon which everything hangs.  To relegate resurrection as metaphor is to pull the plug on the entire redemptive epic. I loved watching him wrestle with that question and I look forward to how he will continue to try and resolve resurrection in his mind and heart."

"" It is simple, it can not be attacked from any point of logic and it is a behavior that strongly reflects the decision you made when you got married.

Ugzw0N3Y3zaPKaTgOAZ4AaABAg,Anime Manga,1526871870539,Holy crap at the end when there taking about the sacrifice of the son. I thought what if it means the sacrifice of the embodiment of what you could be. With Abraham as a parent you always see people trying to make there children better then themselves or into what they wanted to be and With Jesus it would be even the sacrifice of the embodiment of the best you could possibly be to god for god and humanity to have that connection of that there's always something to be subservant to. I was thinking about this because I was thinking about how people sabotage themselves for fear of success or fear of failure and then I was thinking about monks who just give of everything as a sacrifice and I thought the sacrifice of the self I thought wasnt noble enough lol sure they serve as a logo to be inspirational to people like a priest but how can you really help other people without having enough to help them with and then I thought about how dr. Peterson is always saying aim for the highest good or truth or goal and work towards that. And then I thought if you actually could reach that goal then you would have more power to help more people and make a bigger difference through sacrifice like the idea of having alot of money or being rich but not living that way and using you resources to better humanity. The embodiment of the sacrifice of the best you could possibly be. Its just an idea though lol so dont hate me. Or it could just be another test thing. With Abraham sacrificing his son would be sacrificing the very thing god had given him to test him as his descendents would have the nations. And for jesus it would be god showing you the way and then taking that way away so that now it's up to us to pick up the responsibility of making the world a better place with the light already having been shined on the general ideas and directions taught and left in the bible through the morals and lessons another test I guess. P.s. I havnt read the bible so what the hell do I know. Lol.

He was always teaching. We know the resurrected Christ explained the Scriptures concerning Himself to the Apostles. And also that in pre-Cross months He had already started making open references to prophecies regarding the need of the sacrifice. It just makes sense that He would mention the psalm that actually describes the scene that was going on.
In making this prayer his own, Jesus was not expressing a sentiment unique to himself. He was, rather, identifying himself with every human being who has ever felt himself to be at a great distance from God. Perhaps this prayer best expresses what we mean when we speak of “the days of his flesh” (Hebrews 5:7). It was in this deep sense of dereliction that we perceive that “the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst us” (John 1:14)…"

I often say sharp instead of acute, and flat instead of grave; just a habit that formed, for ... some reason  probably related to music, for I learned and played a piano style accordion for several years and there're flat and sharp sounding keys, plus ""buttons"")  Anyway, pronouncing his name as if it ends with acute 'e', é, makes it verbally clear that the name ends with an 'e' rather than no vowel at all; as well as the fact that the name ends with a vowel and that it's pronounced clearly enough that the ending vowel can't be confused or confounded with any other vowel.

UgzTavLHACvBeXXGkkl4AaABAg,in777sight,1524279877538,"Incest is not blessed by God blood even nature shuns it because it causes birth defects and low IQ, Abraham married his sister, Lot had sex with his daughters. Incest formed religious nations that wil fall because they believe the lie that incest is blessed by God blood. Seraphim are 6 winged fighter jets like a F-35, burners, reapers of men that fly with twain, DAS, in 2's in the exact positions described in the Bible. They have coals of fire beneath their wings.
How did Abraham want to be a God? Research Hebrew history and find that Abraham's father was an idol maker .  Abraham had an epiphany. He knew that the stone and wood  were not Gods no matter what form they were made into to be worshipped. What had the power of a God was the Belief they were Gods. They were not Gods but people had Faith they were. So Abraham destroyed his fathers idol making workshop and told everyone there is only one God, Lord God and Lord God blessed Abraham to be the connection with that God. What exists is the Belief, Faith, that Abrahams' God exists. Abrahams' God is no more real that Zeus or Ra but like those King Gods of Egypt, Abraham was able, by deception, to rule as the Hebrew God blessing himself and his sons as Gods and killing everyone that disagreed. 
  The Idol of Abraham is Gold and Silver because what Abraham loves more than truth is wealth and power over people. Abraham does not care if people die in his attempt to steal from them, what is important to Abraham is his lie of his God status remains intact abd believed as truth. All war is unholy war and Abaham rules with fear and wrath and lies and deception.. 
  God exists but God said creation was finished for a reason and that is to make you aware that the lies of the Devils' creation story are about to be told starting Genesis chapter 2 verse 4.. God wants everyone to view how horrible that blood thirsty religion that Abraham invented is, so people would see the reason Jesus was sent to stop belief in it. There is no justice served in killing innocent children.
   Abraham rules earth today because of the vast number of people that have been deceived by his lies and are willing to kill to prove it. Adam as a real man never existed. God did not name the first man or woman. Adam was named by Abraham as a tool used to link himself to a God that Abraham invented out of his imagination so he could rule as a God granting himself the power to kill people and say God commanded it. Adam ate the fruit which did what? Allowed him to BE a God. There are unforgivable sins and telling people what you want is what God wants is unforgivable. 
  No man is a God but Abraham had it written that his sons ARE Gods and they ruled with the power of life and death over the lives of people they would slaughter if anyone disgreed with them. Abraham is Adam, the talking snake and Lord God combined because all 3 are out of the imagination of an evil man that wanted power over people and to get as much money away from others into his own pocket as possible. If that required killing them then Abraham, the king killer, would have them killed because he would lie saying God commanded it. There were generations of people alive in the day Abraham invented his pagan religion and his pagan Lord God, just like some Greek invented Zeus. 
  The Bible is true and it shows the conflict between evil and good. God is the Father of Jesus, the true creator of the universe. Jesus is the Son of God that saves life and teaches truth. Abraham is the Devil that kills people by creating unholy war for power and wealth and Paul is a son of the Devil, killing the Son of God and lying to gain wealth and power."

What it likely is is a reference to Psalm 22, as it begins with those exact words. He also did not give into the temptation of despair at Gethsemane, but was in fact crying for the sins of the world.  Just as He told the women  of Jerusalem not to weep for Him, as He carried the cross, but for the sins of their children.

My understanding is that this psalm was written hundreds of years before Jesus was crucified! So, one way to understand this utterance of Jesus is that the Jews who heard these words would have recognized them as the first line of this psalm, and would have been drawn to remember or consult the rest of the psalm. So, it's possible Jesus said these words as a way to indicate this piece of scripture was being fulfilled. And I don't mean to suggest Jesus may not have genuinely felt abandoned by God at this moment: I think part of this scripture being fulfilled would mean that he genuinely felt that way at that moment."

He kind of defined science this way in some video lecture on bite size philosophy. I think it was called something like fundamentalists versus atheistic scientists.
1. He was named 'earthly representative of the gods', he looked at the slaves and wondered why they were healthier and happier than him. After all, if he was the blessed one then he should have been the healthiest. He realized he wasn't right with God and he changed his name and told his slaves they didn't have to worship him as a god, just honor him as a king favored by God.
2. He stopped trying to live forever by naming his first born with the same name as himself, as was common for the lower class Mesopotamians (and all of the rich ones too) who moved to Egypt to rule as kings did. And so he let his first born have his own life, which was pleasing to True God.
3. He realized that pants+underwear are plenty, so the protective coat could be removed, allowing the sensitive part full access to his woman. Of course it has a lot of nerve endings, on most of your body your hair will let you know if you have a bug on you, and you definitely need to know the second something lands on it if you just let it swing free. But it's not the fun sensitive part, you should pull it down before you put it in.
4. He gave to his son Isaac what developed into a religion of sacrifice (because you aren't currently correct, and sacrifice can help you to figure out how you are wrong). Bull was for the strength of God originally, but basically came to represent human government because kings kept taking it as their symbol. Goat, sheep, ram was for spiritual religion. Dove and pigeon are for the small truths, some holy and from God, some earthly and grey and often annoying. But don't break the truths when you offer them to God (operate in the world like you believe what you believe). But for government and religion, chop them up into manageable pieces and burn them (test them). Only offer them if unblemished of course, don't look to things you know to be wrong and keep doing them.
5. Genesis 25. Abraham sent the sons of his concubines to the east with some wealth, to get away from his son Isaac. I would speculate that they made it to India just in time to be the source of the stories, hopefully they didn't claim godhood, but understandably that is how the story changed. He told them to not sacrifice their bull because he tried to give them a government that could last going on 4000 years now. And the spiritual revolution they brought with them seemed to, in part at least, make it to the Americas, check the timelines, there's evidence of an new advanced people that scientists can't explain where they came from at a time that makes sense for this. I would put forth that Abraham, and not anyone of his sons, is indeed the genetic ancestor to all humans alive today, and the closest common ancestor too. Not much evidence for the sons of his second wife, I would hope they made it to the Celtic people, there is a story that an Egyptian king sent a daughter to the Celts, women represent religion as well, and the Celtic tribe basically became big in the France and Germany region at the same time Joshua conquered the promised land. And if I'm right, the religion was to live in peace with nature and sacrifice bulls. Hopefully evidence of human sacrifice is either Roman dog's lies or was metaphorical with a wicker(straw)man, or perhaps could have been someone else's terrible idea 😣
And there's my hypothesis for the three Abrahamic religions..."

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 

If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master; 
If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:.
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; 

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! '

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And- which is more -you'll be a Man, my son!"

I think I have an answer to the question of both WHY Abraham had to sacrifice his son. and WHY Jesus said ""Father why have you forsaken me"" and WHY he said ""FORGIVE them father for they know not what they do""
WOW 
WOW 
WOW
wow I just understood the meaning of Jesus saying ""God why have you forsaken me."" Someone said its because ""under such conditions even God would have doubts"" and that couldn't be closer to the truth. it means that God in that Moment understood Humans!!! He was able to FORGIVE humans of their sins because he finally understood what having conscious meant. he understood that humans were unable to keep from sinning because the weight of being self aware of gaining that knowledge was too powerful to ever be bestowed upon us. it was such a devastating moment for God to be on that cross, seeing the treachery of the world, to see so deeply the world from OUR perspective the fear the anguish utter anguish we have received not knowing the future. he realized what that faith meant that day. he understood that by giving us a choice of consciousness, WE suffered as his sacrifice, we are forever in that mental agony Jesus suffered, every day of our lives. and so the sacrifice of Jesus was not to save our selves, but instead it was God's way of understanding WHY WE should be saved. he understood the anguish and that led him to have unforsaking love for us. all he asked was that we love him. that to be saved we choose to Do our best to work towards a better good. we are both in this together, him and Us. we can push the world forward or we can hold it back into darkness. but the only way to make it a better place, is to want it to be better.
on that cross God not only saw our perspective, but he saw the fear. the fear of the unknown and he was able to manifest what it would be like to not be an omnipotent being, with the severe weight of consciousness.
And maybe that's what Jesus meant by forgive them father for they know not what they do  because he realized that they actually DONT know. they literally have the weight of all their sacrifice hoping for a better tomorrow. BUT they don't know the future. We can't see it! and thus we are simultaneously left with the whole weight of humanity, while choosing to suffer every day for the sake of tomorrow. and yet tomorrow will never come becsuse we literally will always be in TODAY. it is always today. not tomorrow. and God saw how much that weight beared on us, and for the ""first"" time, he realized what Conciousness truly means.

it means bearing all the responsibility of forever. on yourself today, without being able to KNOW Tomorrow.
so that you can improve tomorrow. Its The ultimate sacrifice. 

And to add to that, He had to sacrifice Jesus because for the first time he felt disguist with himself. That's what makes us humans. Disguist for our creator.
And he felt thst too 
He felt disgusted with hinself. That's why Abraham had to sacrifice his son. If he sacrificed himself he would be virtuous. But he would never feel disgusted as he would by giving up his son for the sake of the world. For God himself.

And so God felt disguist. And with that he for a moment was actually human. 
He hated himself for all of creation and he understood what it means to be human.
Disguist.
And yet, we are still able to choose love, even if we saw  the abomination of creation.
WE still have a choice and for some reason we choose love or malicion. we choose love over ""cocaine""."

His examples of learning to play the piano and learning to read as being ""not really fun"" are completely untrue. From personal experience learning to play the piano, even as I was ""really bad"" was great fun, and learning to read was awesome. I see it in my Nephew right now, even though I've forgotten the experience myself. He LOVES seeing the letters on signs and getting the first one right and asking what the rest of the word is. 

Rhetoric is where the mighty stumble. Dawkins did it in his God Delusion, and Peterson will impale himself if he's not careful about rhetorical devices.

I feel I can add some insight into the vision that Abraham had. I'm curios as to how many people message you describing religious experience, and how many of those you might write off as insane, though you don't strike me as a person who writes people off casually. 
So, I feel it pertinent to share one of my experiences. 
I was driving home after a 14 day hitch of 12 hour shifts on an oil rig in North Dakota. I was about 3 hours into the drive headed West outside Miles City Montana at around 10 pm Listening to the new testament. I came to the point where Jesus is talking about adultery (around Matthew 5:23). The gravity of my sins suddenly came into stark contrast. I know sins are forgiven, but so frequently Christ says go forth and sin no more. I had questions- was it one sin to marry a divorcee, or was I living in sin, and refusing to turn away from it? What was the proper course from there? A moral dilemma. After a few phone calls on the side of the interstate, I was no closer to the answer. I began to pray on the subject. 

I'll say now I never understood the idea of the ""fear of God"" before that moment. 
I was struck with overwhelming terror. I could feel God, the presence, the anger and the disappointment. The knowledge that I had failed in my test, was crippling. In that moment I asked to die. I asked to be forgiven and to die before I could make it home and continue my error. I asked not to be asked to leave, I'm not strong enough, instead I asked for oblivion rather than damnation. I wept. 
The next moment it was gone. The fear, anger and disappointment was replaced by a specific urge. I got out of my car. Not daring to resist, and crossed both sides of I94 in the dark until I came to a barbed wire fence. I climbed it. I counted paces then, it was dark, so dark I couldn't see my feet. 300 paces I walked, the number stuck in my head-  tripping over sage, until i reached 300. I knelt then, I was surprised at how soft the ground was. The grass I had come to, in a rocky area plagued with sage brush and thistles, I had come to soft grass. I knelt, I prayed, and I heard a voice. The elation and overwhelming calm that paired with that voice is indescribable.

In the dark, in a damn cow pasture on soft grass in the spring, East of miles city Montana I heard the voice of God. I was 25,
I was sober. No psychadelics required. I have only dabbled in psychadelics once and I wasn't told until afterwards what I had taken. They said it was mescaline, it was not at all simular, and it was 9 years prior to the event. In that light I wouldn't be as quick to believe that Abraham was intoxicated prior to his vision. 

You said in one of your previous bible lectures that if God was in the habit of making appearances there likely wouldn't be any problem with belief. The problem lies solely on one question.
 What if I'm just insane?"

A critical element of the idea of sacrifice is suffering, ie, in the present for the future. If christ does not suffer the physical, emotional and most importantly existential suffering (why have thee forsaken me) that a human would in that circumstance, then there is no equivalence. As Peterson talks about throughout this series, what really breaks people is when they are betrayed . Assume God can and does understand suffering in every possible way, the greatest sacrifice, act of courage, and faith would be to willingly put your son through that same trial. Why? To affirm existence, life and humanity. As Christ is one also one with god (in the trinity), it is not only christ that suffers in this act, but also god. To assert for life in the face of suffering is faith."

I hope I can express the idea correctly being non native english speaker, its essentially destroying the only thing that will prevail for 'perpetuity' once you're gone.

UgynPtooIRNXZCn7Ux14AaABAg,lauq1,1511233506116,"The sacrifice of Isaac and Jesus are both an ultimate test of faith. You say around 2:24:18 ""You have nothing greater to give than the best of yourself"", and how it seems logical in your view that sacrificing yourself is the greatest you can sacrifice. However, I would argue that for Abraham, who's wife was barren, and who so desperately wants a descendant, and considering the theme/prophecy of the generations that will later reign in the land, his son is actually the greatest sacrifice. You could also see it this way; if you'd be an old father and you would have to choose between sacrificing yourself or your son, then the choice is obvious to me that you sacrifice yourself for your son('s future) - and that's why it seems logical to me that instead of Abraham is asked to do the most heartwrenching; the ultimate test of faith, since if it's true, his son would be resurrected.

EDIT: More symbolically speaking, maybe you could argue that during the first part of your life, you make sacrifices for your future potential, and as you grow older (and hopefully some of the potential has been realized) the future potential declines; however, your descendant is in some way your continuing future potential; just like with Abram! He makes great sacrifices, and only after 4 generations his kin would reign. Future potential; the higher good, the transcendent, is something you aim at for your life, as well as for your descendants."

UgzsM2FdDgGeNzYVx3l4AaABAg,Dr Timothy,1511233506173,"Although I am myself a believer in god, I do not think that just because some bad things are stated in the bible is enough to dismiss the wish-fulfillment or death-anxiety or the control the masses interpretations of the bible. For instance: The devil and his realm to which the wicked are sent serves many functions to these theories: Its wish fulfillment to think those you hate will be punished, it alleviate death anxiety by motivating people to avoid dying when they're bad, and encouraging them to embrace death when they are righteous. If its to control the masses: then if you want to control the masses, make it so that they fear disobedience. Otherwise, disobey all you want you still go to heaven when the state kills you. 
As far as the ""realistic dealings"" and ""not everything going right when you obey"" If you believed in a god who only did good benevolent things and nothing ever went wrong when you followed him, then the slightest injustice or evil in the world would turn people away, I mean look at the amount of people who think there's too much suffering in the world for there to be a god in the bible's current state.
The commandments are enough to dispel the idea of wish fulfillment (some of them anyway), the death anxiety could be dispelled by the idea that the commandments are tough enough that you might never get into God's kingdom, the mass controller theory can be dispelled with the parts ware god denounced faith in princes and when he denies giving the Israelis kings, and when Christ continuously finds himself in trouble with the priests. Why would any self-respecting mass controlling state allow those kinds of verses in?

Remember how wet and cold the men were and they'd have to crawl into their wet cold beds at night? Ugh! One man kind of broke down after all this and Shackleton  had some difficulty with that. Given our snowflakes-in-safety-land-lives, such books can help strengthen us and develop gratitude. 

Another great book is Sufferings in Africa, a book that greatly affected Abraham Lincoln. Captain James Riley and his crew get shipwrecked in early 1800s and are kidnapped by Islamic slave traders. But a couple Muslims end up saving the remaining crew in the end. In this retelling, you see humanity in all its good and evil. 

Btw, our American founders, by encoding a ""pursuit of happiness"" into our Declaration of God-given liberty, weren't thinking like narcissists in pursuit of perpetual entertainment. Tragedy and suffering are definitely part of the human condition, but they are not supposed to be our daily gruel. Joy and gratitude might have been more apt word choices for today's surface skimmers, but a pursuit of one's talents and gifts for the benefit of humankind definitely alleviates suffering....and what a happy turnabout that is for the thoughtful and free."

I completely understand the significance of the underlying archetypal stories that are fully embedded in the bible and I do believe them to be ""true"" in the petersonian sense.

Having said that, I am truly against any strict doctrine and entity that is established to promote that doctrine. i.e. the church. It's another form of the tower in my opinion. 

Another issue I have is that, while these archetypes are probably most fully developed in the bible, just by fact of iteration over eons, does not really mean the actual stories are significant. Only the underlying extractable wisdom. But alot of people arent smart enough to pull it out themselves (including me. I would never have cracked the surface without Prof. Petersons lectures)
So why not pull out the abstract wisdom and make it physical in a way that can't get more direct, and then dispense with the unneeded portions. 

Jordan has said saying these stories are make believe is throwing the baby out with the bath water. So my question is why is not possible to simply throw out the dirty water without the baby?"

By Rudyard Kipling


If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!"

Abraham is not the father of unidentified nations, no, those nations consists of the 12-tribes of Israel (non-Jewish), Abraham was an Adamite, his son Isaac was an Adamite, and Isaac's son Jacob was an Adamite meaning white nation. Jacobs 12-sons were all Adamites (which has the meaning of white person) thus those 12-Nations of which Abraham is the father of, are all Jacobs'  12-sons, later called the children of Jacob (Israel) or the children of Israel after their fathers new name as God changed the name of Jacob to Israel (Gen 35:10-26). That Biblical Israel is the name of a man, it has nothing to do with that fraudulent state of Israel which can be found today next to the red sea...those Jews hijacked the name Israel in 1948 to mislead the real sons of Jacob which are scattered across the face of the globe and Scripture tells us that they will be scattered and stay scattered until the second coming of Messiah. So, clearly those Jews are nothing but sly thieves who faked the so-called ""return of Israel to the promised land"" for their own benefit and to mislead the real children of God.What is the whole purpose of the Jews and their father the Devil on earth? It is to deceive and mislead God children in all manner of ways so that they will not be able to enter God's Kingdom the New Jerusalem on the New Earth.

“The spiritual differs from the religious 
in being able to endure isolation. 
The rank of a spiritual person is proportionate 
to his strength for enduring isolation, 
whereas we religious people are constantly 
in need of ‘the others,’ the herd.
We religious folks die, or despair, 
if we are not reassured by being in the assembly, 
of the same opinion as the congregation, and so on. 
But the Christianity of the New Testament is 
precisely related to the isolation of the spiritual man.”

I'm someone who went from constantly wishing he'd die in his sleep so he didn't have to face this cruel world any longer, who constantly berrated himself for being too spineless to kill himself for well over a decade, to someone happy and well adjusted, most of the time. The secret is to build a strong relationship with yourself. To do this, 'you' need to rescue your damaged inner child from the past, the you who was so battered by your siblings, parents, peers and teachers that has not left scars but open wounds, wounds that cause regressions back to those hurtful times that you've long forgotten everytime someone stops you from doing or getting what you want. Children and partners cause these regressions mostly because we're so emotionally attached to them and will continue too until you go back and give yourself what you needed that you're constantly looking for others to give you but never will. I highly recommend a book called Homecoming by Dr John Bradshaw, he showed me all the ways my wounded inner child effected my adult life and how to go back and heal those open wounds. Then I was able to stand by myself and support myself rather than constantly tearing myself down everytime the littlest thing would go wrong. I was then able to cure my co-dependence on women to allow me to live happily alone stress free. Finding yourself, healing yourself, supporting yourself is the key to happiness.

Or were they written for our times, and thus in a sense prophetically? He is amazed to see how these texts have been studied for ages. Yes, indeed. Biblical scholarship goes back to the Hebrew scribes, let’s say about the time of the second temple. Since then we have layer upon layer of interpretation.

Since the basic action he is enacting is that of sacrifice, and a complete one at that,  what if that is the moment when the Christ God sacrifices his last and most important  possession, faith itself. Doubt and Despair  seem to be two very defining human experiences and if humanity is to be redeemed then the redemptive act needs to contain these within it's substance. The sacrifice done with unwavering faith is not the same as that done through a loss and then recovery of said faith. There seems to be a qualitative difference there because one, to use Peterson's idea, sort of incorporates the shadow.

But I have a complaint and criticism, and I would be direct.

The way you have , here and at an other place, tried to evade the question about the resurrection of the 'historical Jesus'so to speak, disheartened me. I know that you might've had your reasons to do that. Sometimes, the faith and belief in the irrational forms the basic substructure of all of our rational arguments and personalities. Maybe ""Jesus as the literal son of the god, or the transcendent"" is that substructure for you or maybe you really want to hold on to the faint possibilities of having life after death, out of body experiences, literal heavens and hell or things like that.. who knows... ?

Ugz95VWqEaG4HAGlAkR4AaABAg,ThompsonDB,1503284747332,"Regarding the last question, it seems apparent to me that most parents would consider their children more valuable than them. So Peterson suggesting that the highest sacrifice is yourself is true, unless you have children. It's something like a clear demonstration that you'd be willing to sacrifice what you most care for as a sort of contract with God that ensures the favour returned. Maybe also that unless you are God you cannot be expected to actually sacrifice your child for the good, that it's a truly divine act that doesn't work for mere mortals. Children represent the future, so if a human in linear time sacrifices the future it doesn't work out because that's game over, but God being outside of linear time allows for sacrifice outside of our parameters, our willingness to game over ourselves is an intimation of our link and divine heritage."

Okay, so what does the ideal produce? If you achieved your ideal, you reached perfection. Jesus is regarded as ""perfect"" by Christians, so the idea fits. But this brings us back to the walled garden that we emerged from in the earliest stories. So is the sacrifice of Christ, from a JBP perspective, symbolic of humankind's absolute rejection of the of complacency, or rejecting the idea of dwelling in paradise? Institutionally, we had achieved Rome, the greatest civilization, and the Jews couldn't stop themselves from breaking themselves against it. I think that as a symbol, given the time period in which it occurs, this suggestion works pretty well. We'll see what the Master Mind says in future installments."

UgwYA1OZ8xYUjRiDHL14AaABAg,Steven Jones,1503284747418,"I Think I know the answer to the last question. Abraham did NOT sacrifice Isaac. God provided the Ram. Which was a new thing in Abraham's time and area.  At the time the main religion was Babylonian where each person had their own personal god. Abraham just turned out to be talking to the only real God among all the gods of the babylonian's. We know this because he does provide a ram instead of a human body part or life. At that time. If there was something wrong you sacrificed your kids arm to cure epilepsy or cut off their fingers in hopes your personal god would fix the issues or at the least give a reward to you later for now having a kid with no arm or no kid at all if they died. 

When Abraham takes Isaac up and God stops him from killing his son? This is a new thing to the men of the area. No God has ever provided the sacrifice before.  They had been living with personal gods for centuries. Now Abraham's God has provided the ram.  No longer any need to kill or hurt your kids to please the gods. If you read the story many houses (babylonian tribes) claim relationship to Abraham and they all move away right after this event. Why..?

Now we move to the cross. Jesus as God is once again providing the sacrifice for mankind.  However, if you listen Jesus calls out to not just God the Father but also to God The Holy Spirit. This is why he says My God My God.  He addressing both of them who have been a part of him for infinity. (Think Body, Soul, Spirit here) and who have for the last three years guided him to this very point of death.  Remember Jesus set this all up to be taken and killed.  He dies right after this event with these final words... ""it is finished"".  What was Finished? THE SACRIFICE FOR MANKIND'S SIN! God the Father can not be where sin is. Jesus was taking all the sin of mankind unto himself at this point and God the Father and God The Holy Spirit Can not be near Jesus. (Think Out of Body Experience here like you have died and do not know where you are. Now only in reverse you have lived forever and now do not feel life) Jesus the now human bodied man was now having this same type of experience we all have had but only for the 1st time...SEPARATION FROM GOD  because of our sin. Jesus calls out to the two of them as they turn unable to look upon his sin riddle body and then Jesus dies. 

This was God making a new Covenant with mankind.  God will provide the ULTIMATE of sacrifice. His only Son. So that...
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

God ended his Life here on earth so that you could just simply believe in The Son of God to have A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD AND WALK IN THE LIGHT OF GOD FREE FROM SIN FOREVER!  No more Ram killings and Blood and Alter stuff.  ANYONE and EVERYONE can now have a personal relationship with God. Would not a real God make salvation as simple as just believing in the infinite Logos? The Son of God Jesus. (And the Logos Became Flesh and Walked Amongst Us. John 1:14)   How much easier can God make it for People?

I've noticed over the years that Google would proudly post a Privacy Statement, but as soon as their Privacy Statement got in the way of something they wanted to do they would adjust the Privacy Statement; it doesn't bind Google in any way. It is just there to lull users into a feeling of trust.  4. I refuse to use Chrome because it will just help Google scrape even more information."

UgwXjQtQmrMAoSAk9J94AaABAg,brrrayday,1503284753289,"Why was Abraham asleep during the big sacrifice with God?

In Ancient Jewish tradition, when two people made a powerful covenant (contract) they would cut the sacrifice in two, and both would take a torch and circle the pieces.  This implied that they were both making a sacrifice to establish the covenant.  When God put Abraham asleep, and circled the sacrifice by Himself, God was enacting in physical form a covenant that was essentially one-sided.  That basically, there was nothing that Abraham or his progeny could do that would invalidate the covenant, that God Himself would establish it through His sacrifice alone.

This is core to understanding the geographical nation of Israel, as well as their position as priests to the Living God; that, no matter their sin, God would not forsake his covenant with Abraham, His promise will be fulfilled regardless how wrongly the Jews may act.

Hope this helps the curious!"

The Jews who heard it would have understood that Jesus the Redeemer they had been waiting for.

UgyJXoiqEGzYKCJXB8V4AaABAg,King-Emperor Botolf Zane Isembard of Pleiades,1503284753367,"On what Peterson says about bad trips and not getting passed the issue within your life, etc.  

I once took shrooms, I was I'd say 22 maybe.  Maybe 21.   
And I was home alone, living with my mom.  And at the time was trying to have something profound happen.  I wanted to be shaken up, I wanted something to ""happen"".  I felt like I was waiting, which I often feel. 

And during this trip.  I had everything ready, the day prior I took shrooms and had a really solid experience, and so the next day I took the rest, and laid on the couch in my room.  By the window, set and organized everything.  
Had the air blowing to a nice temp, water ready, took ginger for my stomach, and so fourth.  

It felt it wasn't kicking in, I'd say 30 or so minutes in.  I wasn't feeling anything, where as the day prior it was hitting within what felt like 15 minutes.  

So I decided to smoke some weed, given it wasn't doing anything.  Or so I thought.  
After smoking a small amount, I was thinking I was just gonna go to sleep.  Given I was semi tired and usually smoking makes me tired.  
Well, I decided to put this play list on, it's my ""dmt"" playlist.  And put the song ""small grey creatures"" by shulman.  
At this point I'm running into maybe an hour, after taking the shrooms.  
At this point it all really hit, all at once.  I all of a sudden got a sensation of being watched.  I felt as though the room got really cold.  
The song felt like it went on for a really long time. 
Still laying down, I look in the direction on where I felt I was being watched.  And the space in the room behind me was black, really dark, even though the windows were open with moon light coming into the room.  

Being I assumed it was just going to be mild hallucinations, I left the music on, and got up, and kinda walked into the misty black emptiness.  And it looked as though a void vapor was moving off the floor, against the wall and onto my mantel.  
I approached the mist being I wanted to test my hallucinations, and it went then from the mantel into the upper corner of my room.  
I was thinking ""damn this is some pretty wicked shit"" 

I decide to do some random things here and there as the overall experience begins to become heavier, I decide to go downstairs, (which the house has no lights on) and got more water, and then i started to what I call ""spotting"" I start to bob in and out of immediate consciousness.  I was in the kitchen, standing with the water, then in the living room, then sitting in a chair, then in the hallway upstairs, I start to become nervous and have some anxiety because I start to lose immediate control of what I'm doing.  
It then didn't really help that I left the really intense music on looking back.  

I decided to just lay down, and kept telling myself it's just a bad trip.  
When I get back in my room, I notice the black mist thing was still there.  And again felt like I was being watched.  

After laying down, I close my eyes, try and relax.  Once I open them to sit up because again it's becoming more and more heavy as the time goes by.  
And at this point I realize the black thing was then covering the entire floor.  I was brought back to the sensation of when you're a kid and your bed is your safe space.  
This is the point where I'm Really tripping.  I say out loud ""I really don't like this, this is too much"" over and over.  Trying to just breath and hoping it would pass.  Which it didn't.  
The music at this point all starts to sound like static.  
No matter the song, it's just all fuzzy static with weird noises morphing in my head.  
I turned it off, and the separation between reality and the trip seems to slip away.  I start having this almost conversation within myself. 
I think I fully detached from the idea of it was just a trip, I just kinda left.  
The black misty thing was then making what looked like waves within the room and it looked like a fully void space around me.  
I then started hearing things, and seeing black apportion type figures all around the room.  
I then again felt like I was being watched, and looked up and saw this egg shaped black thing above me.  I asked out loud ""what do you want"" And that's when it felt like it plunged at me and I fell into an eternal black emptiness.  I feel I had an out of body experience.  
I was full on out of my mind tripping during this period ( I had an 8th of shrooms) 
And I in this full hallucination, stood up, looked around and it was black empty cold space.  
I then realized I was in hell, and got really frightened.  I thought I died.  
And the black void thing was there, and started chasing me like the chasing you when you're a kid running up the stairs feeling like something is behind you.  
And didn't know what to do, I thought I was dead, and so I shouted out the only thing I could ""GOD GOD, IM SORRY, PLEASE HELP ME, PLEASE"" so on.  
And this flicker of light similar to a star flickers up in the distance, I'm reaching my hand out fully running while in this full panic and this overpowering light comes toward me and seemed to fill the black space and I then felt like I rubber banded back into my body waking up, with everything gone.  All the sensation, gone.  I felt really normal.  Still tripping but not feeling this negative energy anymore.  

At the time I wasn't really religious, idk if I'd call myself religious even now but it was a really spiritual, and religious experience.  

I at that point got up and turned all the lights on and kinda looked around and felt like I had just had some profound happen.   I start doing all sorts of random things, and felt great.  
After laying down an hour or so later, I got this feeling of authority, or fatherliness above me.  I have a good relationship with my dad, however.  He's not absent in my life.  
And had a message felt in my head of something a grandpa or dad would tell you when you're fucking up,   I felt a spiritual pinning down asking me something similar to ""what are you doing with yourself.  You're loaded wasting your life, you need to do something with yourself"" etc
I felt like a deer in headlights or dog being pinned down by its owner.  
I've always felt I've had a guiding spirit with me, and it felt that spirit was there.  Telling me this.  

I then had a flash of knowing what I needed to do.  I always Knew what I was supposed to do.  But I just wasn't doing it.  
I at that moment got up, and started packing things.  Determined of what I was going to do.  I was 21 or 22, and knew I needed to become my own person, so to speak.  I needed to move out and start being self sufficient.  
So after getting literally everything organized, I wrote down a plan.  And within 6 months was out.  I had a very active few years after that.  I would say that whole experience really impacted my life.  

I've never taken shrooms again.  But I've taken lsd once.  
I don't drink or smoke pot anymore.  And that was I'd say 3-4 years ago.  And it was a big turning point.

I would however, totally drop lsd, take shrooms, or smoke dmt again.  It feels like a hard reset of your brain."

""But that is impossible, my dear child... The hole cannot contain all that water"" said the man.

UgxDup8H-PXHOWNlptd4AaABAg,deathbybassofficial,1503284757624,"So the last question had to do with the statement of Christ on the cross, asking "" Why hast thou forsaken me "". The interpretation to me has always been something like this. I never enjoyed The Passion of the Christ because it seems to convey that the cross was merely a physiological suffering, whereas Christ's crucifixion was perhaps more forgiving than most, traditionally speaking. 

The burden of the cross for Christ was more along the lines of him having to become and embody the sins of the world, and that when he did that he would be separated from the divine, and the separation would be too much to bear. This is reflected in the garden of Gethsemane, where Christ asks that "" This cup be taken from him "", indicating that he does not want to be cast out of the realm of the sacred.

And so when the father turns his face away from Christ, he's doing it because in that moment, Christ is sin embodied and as such is forsaken by God."

Western Europe,and now Canada have been feminized to such an extent they are on the verge of extinquishing themselves. Well, perhaps Canada can be saved from the worst Arab Alpha Male pit vipers on the planet. Not so with Europe.

Have any of you women read ""Fifty Shades of Grey""? I am asking because I have heard it is less then flattering to women. Specifically, a sort of ""Male Domination"" fantasy? In any case, clearly Europe has imported the worst Arab Alpha male pit vipers on the planet for nursing back to health and the women seem really really good with it.

And I mean pathologically good with it. Swedish and German women very publicly refuse to blame the pit vipers for molestation. They tell us very publicaly the poor dears do not know any better! WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM! 

This story is as old as time itself. Women are genetically programed to seek out alpha males and alpha males they will have. Western men have, essentially, been under leftist and feminist assault for generations. The most advanced result is Sweden. 

Sweden has about 150 Islamic places so dangerous they do not have national postal service. Those places do have Islamic sharia gangs, of course. Everything else will become history in three generations.

And lefters want to bring all this right here to North America. Canada is so feminized they are seeking out Arab Pit Vipers for themselves at this very moment! For instance, they have Human Rights Tribunals with no due process but plenty of feminine righteous indignation to protect Islam from insult!

The crazy monkey that invented this term ""God"" was the Shakespeare of Monkeys (the same monkey on the typewriter who accidentally started to write Hamlet).  So this monkey idea of God has come down to us and as empty as the concept is -- there is no God! -- it still influences humankind for millenniums, in strange and wondrous ways, so that Peterson can still devote hours to this absolutely empty subject.  The emptiest of subjects can produce an infinite plethora of thought and wisdom... ""words, words, words.""  So God is just like Hamlet -- both fiction -- and that it still continues to intrigue and befuddle mankind.  Out of nothing (the fiction of God, God as an abstraction) something comes...

UgxdpQKiZhf6T23D3zJ4AaABAg,Milk Man,1503284763472,"Who discovered men are free?
 No one knows who first made the 
discovery that men are free. The fragmentary records begin with one 
person. There is no historical proof that he really existed, but the 
story holds its own self-evident truth; and for countless generations, 
it was handed down from father to son.
 They said that when Ur was
 the great empire. (about 4,000 years ago)That was back in the days when
 people believed that everything was controlled by the whims and fancies
 of pagan gods. Water-gods, when they felt so disposed, made water flow;
 sea-gods moved the waves and tides;
 air-gods controlled the winds;  gods whispered in trees, roared in thunder, and brought rain to the fields. Fertility-gods caused seeds to sprout and women to bear 
children.Gods controlled men just as they controlled all other things. As
 water ran and winds blew, so men thought and felt and acted as the gods
 might will. 

But Abraham denied the existence of all these pagan gods. 
He insisted that there is only one God-the God of all things, the God 
who creates and judges. He taught his increasing family that God is 
Rightness, Reality, and Truth; that man is free and self-controlling and
 responsible for his own acts; that each person is free to do good or 
evil, as he may choose, but that any wrong act will result in punishment
 to the evildoer. Much later another mighty work is performned to extract the hebrews from bondage,and LIVE for
 FORTY YEARS in the desert."
Ugwh9d-fD9aKLk5RFaR4AaABAg,btdtpro,1503284763482,"Jesus saying ""my God, my God, why have you forsaken me"", was Jesus quoting Psalm 22:1, a passage that foreshadowed what was happening to him at that very moment.

During Jesus day, they didn't have numbered verse in the scripture,  so to reference a section of scripture people were just say the first words of the section.

This is Psalm 22 and I'll bold some of the parts the referenced what Jesus was going though right then.
You can also see, that through this part of scripture starts, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"", the message of the it is, how God has never forsaken him and how God does fulfilling the promises made, Jesus being the final fulfillment of the promises God had made. After referencing Psalm 22, his next and final words are “It is finished.” This is because he dies right after, but also because the work to fulfill the promise is finished, thus the promise is fulfilled 

1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
    Why are you so far from saving me,
    so far from my cries of anguish?
2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
    by night, but I find no rest.
3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
    you are the one Israel praises.
4 In you our ancestors put their trust;
    they trusted and you delivered them.
5 To you they cried out and were saved;
    in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
6 *But I am a worm and not a man,
    scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
7 All who see me mock me;
    they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say,
    “let the Lord rescue him.
Let him deliver him,
    since he delights in him.”
9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;
    you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
10 From birth I was cast on you;
    from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
11 Do not be far from me,
    for trouble is near
    and there is no one to help.
12 Many bulls surround me;
    strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
13 Roaring lions that tear their prey
    open their mouths wide against me.
14 I am poured out like water,
    and all my bones are out of joint.
My heart has turned to wax;
    it has melted within me.
15 My mouth is dried up like a potsherd,
    *and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth*;
    you lay me in the dust of death.
16 Dogs surround me,
    a pack of villains encircles me;
    they pierce my hands and my feet.
17 All my bones are on display;
    people stare and gloat over me.
18 They divide my clothes among them
    and cast lots for my garment.
19 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
    You are my strength; come quickly to help me.
20 Deliver me from the sword,
    my precious life from the power of the dogs.
21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
    save me from the horns of the wild oxen.
22 I will declare your name to my people;
    in the assembly I will praise you.
23 You who fear the Lord, praise him!
    All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
    Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!
24 For he has not despised or scorned
    the suffering of the afflicted one;
he has not hidden his face from him
    but has listened to his cry for help.
25 From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
    before those who fear you I will fulfill my vows.
26 The poor will eat and be satisfied;
    those who seek the Lord will praise him—
    may your hearts live forever!
27 All the ends of the earth
    will remember and turn to the Lord,
and all the families of the nations
    will bow down before him,
28 for dominion belongs to the Lord
    and he rules over the nations.
29 All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
    all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
    those who cannot keep themselves alive.
30 Posterity will serve him;
    future generations will be told about the Lord.
31 They will proclaim his righteousness,
    declaring to a people yet unborn:
    He has done it!"

He seems to be using the biblical text as a springboard for re-treading his core beliefs, as he has previously done with Pinnochio and The Lion King. 
As with most people, I agree with some of his ideas, and not with others, and although I'm an atheist, I certainly agree that the bible is an important work of literature, from which truth and wisdom can be derived. I also agree that the hard anti-theist position that it is a lot of superstitious nonsense only fit to be thrown in the bin is erroneous ( yes, AronRa I'm talking to you).

UgzoAyfb65hDtsQPrWh4AaABAg,HadesXY,1503284765562,"1:34:00 I worked part time as mortician when I studied. On weekends and night shift, when the weird things happen or are found. Everyone of my friends and my family asked how I was able to do it. Going into apartments of dead strangers, sometimes they were left for weeks until someone noticed the smell and we were called (top was 1 year, he was mummified; died in winter with an open window, dried out before the insects got him, very interesting)

Beside those I had 
suicides (jumping from building, gun to the head, standing in front of a train), 
accidents (road worker hit by a car; or someone who hit his bowling partner who was on foot and he came by car one crossroad before the bowling hall), 
unforeseen heart attacks (in a fast food restaurant; on the only toilet in a 6 person household)
and heartbreaking things like a little girl that hold her grand dads hand and didn't wanted to let it go

Why was I able to shake it of when I came home? It was hard but you started to think about life, not death. Nobody expects the mortician. You find their home in a state of chaos. when they are expecting no visitors. You come back to your place. look at it and ask yourself ""Do I want to be found in this"" and also ""Do I want to be found in 3 months or by the end of the week, because there are still people who care""

And what made it much easier as people would expect. In the end we were strangers. I didn't knew them, never will hear from their families again. No connection that broke, in hard cases like the suicide by train I also simply switched my brain off and didn't even recognized I was collecting parts of a body. It was simply flesh at that moment."

I think that it is a question that everyone has to answer for themselves and not by trusting in the wisdom of some higher authority. 
The way that you answer this question is also a sacrifice. You are risking being considered gullible and naive, and weighing it against being able to call yourself a Christian in earnest, rather than just being someone who appreciates the wisdom to be found in the Biblical stories."
UgyVr9N99GRPsXUQZoN4AaABAg,Нова,1503284773775,"This interpretive schema seems really useful, at least in restricted sections of the Bible:

Holy Spirit = Idea Conscience (dove, or golden sun around head, indicating Aiming Towards the Good)
Jesus = Ideal Individual (Action in the world)
God the Father = Ideal Society (Society over the past and the future and present, structure as opposed to nature. Ideal might not be the perfect word. It's the abstraction of Societies' patterns over eternity probably trending towards idealism)

""Jesus sacrificed himself for the good of humanity"" = The ideal Individual sacrifices themself for the good of humanity
""If you kill, God will smite you and send you to hell."" = If you kill, the Society will (penalize) you and send you to (prison)
""God created man in his image."" = People give birth to people.

Q: ""Why did God create disease and war if he loves us?"" A: ""I don't know; why did we?""

""Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen."" - perhaps because they are micro manifestations of God
""No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us."" - the Ideal society hasn't come yet?

""For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus."" - the individual is the mediator towards ideal society

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. - society is speech

“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

""Holy Spirit, Jesus, and God are not each other but are all the same thing"" = An Ideal Conscience creates an Ideal Individual, which makes up the ideal Society. An Ideal Society creates Ideal Individuals with Ideal Consciences. 

I think those paintings of Christ on the cross are not just a crucifixion scene, they are a depiction of the Holy Trinity, with a golden sun or dove behind Christ, Christ, and society gathered around him."

Ugy1kKTxSLQl7oOuVXd4AaABAg,Lahbreca,1503284780923,"Peterson mentioned in his last lecture on Abraham the fact that Abraham's character is very flawed, considering that he is a ""man of God"". I've always thought, like Peterson seems to, that this picture has it's merits. 

If the ""men of God"" are flawed, but still able to embody the optimal way of being in some way, and walk with God despite their flaws, that gives each of us a chance at it as well - because we are also most certainly flawed.

Islam shares a lot of the same prophets with Christianity and Judaism - they also have stories of Abraham and Noah and Moses. But they uphold the notion that these men were sinless and flawless. Many muslims see the flawed nature of the prophets and the men of God in Christianity and judaism as an off-putting flaw.

But just like Peterson seems to see it, it gives a life-likeness to the story, as well as gives a proper chance for each of us - God is already a perfect example of the ideal - maybe the idea of a prophet of God should be of a fallible man, that despite his faults still is able to converse and walk with the divine - whatever that means.

*

There seems to be a very similar motif in Tolkien's writings - which should not be surprising, as he was Catholic. His characters are also very dualistic in nature - even the purest of the Fellowship are tempted by the ring. The Fellowship, even as it tries to aim at the highest good - the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron - is still beset constantly by human (or hobbitlike) failings of character, missteps, and even a few downright evil deeds like Boromir's betrayal.

The journey of the Fellowship is indeed very much beset on all sides by danger and strife and hardship - but it manages to still progress, align itself again and again with the highest good, and proceed towards the worthy ending to a fantastic story.

In that sense, the journey of the Fellowship and the nature of the characters seems to reflect the Biblical stories somewhat.

*

I find Tolkien's works quite engaging in this sort of mythical/symbolic/religious manner. Even one of the most poignant descriptions of Christ I've encountered in my life comes form the Lord of the Rings. There is a scene where Frodo is faced with the duplicitous nature of Gollum, and has mercy on him, while still fully articulating that he knows how wretched he really is.

There is a constant to-and-fro between Frodo and Sam concerning Gollum, and how they should treat him - Sam sees Frodo as naive, overly trusting, and too soft-hearted, while Frodo sees Sam as overly judgemental and harsh - and he seems to be that to some degree..

There is one scene where Frodo seems to arrive at a sort of divine middle between mercy and judgement - realizing the wretched nature of Gollum fully, and still having mercy on him.

I'm not sure if that was a conscious parallel on Tolkien's part, but nevertheless I think essentially that's what the scene is about.

Mercy at it's highest form, I claim, is not naive, but fully aware of exactly how wretched the other person is, and still has mercy on him. Of course we all fall inevitably sort of the ideal - that's kind of the definition of divine ideal.

*

There are a lot of other very deep insights like this in Tolkien's works. Even if his works were fantasies, and even if he wrote about hobbits and dwarves and elves, his writing is thoroughly imbued with contemplation about human nature - there is a lot of mythical and religious substructure there."
UgxWTJNb5vWADmDdRY54AaABAg,SK,1503284780933,"I have a question for anyone who cares to share his or her views (assuming that anybody even sees this comment among all the memes and fun-poking).  Jordan Peterson says (min 53 to 55) that the goal of discipline is to become disciplined so that you can emerge from that free. Without questioning the empirical validity of that progression from discipline to freedom, I am still wondering whether the thus found freedom is basically a radical acceptance of (or habituation to) the limitations of the discipline. As a simplified example, if one just starts going to the gym, that would feel like submitting to a discipline or (initially unpleasant) regiment. But later, if that person becomes fit, he or she will indeed become free in some sense, e.g. becoming more confident, but he or she is not likely to stop going to the gym. So, this freedom is not getting rid of the discipline - it's more like radically accepting it. Any ideas, anyone?"

Abraham is called to give his son, whom he really doesn't want to loose, away into the hands of God. This could mean that for being to go into a proper direction, the father has to let go of what he thinks is right for his son and give him away out of his own hands into the hands of being at large. Abraham has to let his son be guided by God, which would take place outside of his own experience. And then by doing this, he doesn't actually loose his son.

I think this is an interesting idea, but it kinda seems too shallow to me... it's too specific to the father as a subset of human beings instead of talking about the human experience in general"

Mate, I love your videos and am proud of how you've stood up for anti political correctness. Buddy were doing the same, we don't hate women, we hate the same system that indoctrinates the same people that challenge you and the alt society. 
I'm still a fan, were on the same page. The entitled females and emasculated males that are ripping you apart are the ones we are walking away from... Also the policies that are creating this. Hope you understand, we're on the same team."

It's nothing special, a moderator. But it leaves a trail to who done it. So some SJW in that position worked up the balls to do it to a high profile person for his own reasons. Perhaps delusional enough to think it would stick. A reasonable higher-up found out, and the ban was lifted. There's no system, it's just action, reaction."

I did happen to be on LSD at the time but I feel that enabled it to happen, not caused it. I became quite literally physically possessed and a quest was set before me. The whole thing had a Christian theme. The force spoke to me through the bible. So to me here and now these stories have a literal concrete base in this reality. not purely mythological.

The whole thing relates to these stories in such a real way.

Also,  I have no history of mental illness or schizophrenia."
