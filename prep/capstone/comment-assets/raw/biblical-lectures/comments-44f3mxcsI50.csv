I feel as though Dr. Peterson's explanation of this is not complete, missing another whole element of God that I understand. What about forgiveness? Isn't God trying to teach brutal mankind to forgive? Isn't God considered to be the embodiment of mercy and forgiveness?

As Dr. Peterson says, tit-for-tat isn't a good solution to the problem, and this does sound like an objective explanation of the concept of forgiveness, but I don't think it gets to the heart of the matter.

UgwlnIOWdagr4xSHzsZ4AaABAg,P N,1532142132794,"CAIN VS. ABEL - GOD DOESN'T FAVOR AGRICULTURE REPLACING NOMADIC SHEPHERDING
(FYI: We think we're so much smarter than men of the past.  Not so.  For centuries it has been considered that Scripture has four levels of interpretation:  the literal, the allegorical, the moral, and the anagogical. What follows is an intepretation, not claiming to be exhaustive - but I don't see that JBP covers it as a possibility - his ideas are GREAT and super important - but so is looking at the trajectory of human development - we're only been agriculturalists for 11,000 years and it hasn't led to a good place IMHO - we can at least be self-aware of its effect on human character)

AGRICULTURE (CITIES) BEGAN TO REPLACE THE WAYS OF THE HUNTER-GATHERER - GOD'S PREFERENCE FOR ABEL

CAIN VS. ABEL - GOD DOESN'T FAVOR AGRICULTURE REPLACING NOMADIC SHEPHERDING (God did not prefer it to say the least - angering Cain.  God even warned Cain of Cain's character propensities (""possession,"" really), and to be SUPER wary of it.  Cain is essentially the precursor of city dwellers.  Antifa comes from the cities.  (heh heh Just placing this in OUR time - also, from city dwellers came the industry-created modes of agriculture including monocropping, superweeds, (re medicine, MRSA; re Defense, nuclear bombs)...just to get started.  I'm a conservative Republican in case you're wondering, Catholic by choice, but wish the Demmies would get their act together and be able to LEAD on some fronts.

INTERPRETING CAIN IN RELATION TO HIS CITY DWELLING - ""SETTLED FARMERS"" - WITHOUT AGRICULTURE THERE WOULD NOT BE ""CITIES"" or in the past, Nation States like Athens and Rome.

From wiki:

""In all versions, Cain is a crop farmer and his younger brother Abel is a shepherd.  Cain is portrayed as sinful, committing the first murder by killing his brother, after God has rejected his offerings of produce but accepted the animal sacrifices brought by Abel. 

""The oldest known copy of the Biblical narration is from the 1st century Dead Sea Scrolls. Cain and Abel also appear in a number of other texts, and the story is the subject of various interpretations.

""A few scholars suggest it may have been based on a Sumerian story representing the conflict between nomadic shepherds and settled farmers.  Others think that it may refer to the days in which agriculture began to replace the ways of the hunter-gatherer.""

I think we can agree that Scripture contains (at the very least) powerful depictions and analyses of the human condition - it gets to the root of very many things.  You don't have to believe it to be literal or (dare I say) even divinely inspired, to reap a very great deal from it.

ASIDE:  I love Leo Strauss's ""An Intepretation of Genesis.""  (it's online)  He nails why there are two creation stories in Genesis (something I actually had never noticed), for instance.  Was he a believer?  ""He lived as if it were true"" to quote JBP re similar individuals - AND Strauss does the Bible the great honor of viewing it as word perfect."

You can argue the brain is like a super computer that postulates the best outcome but it falls short.

And more.importantly it is true in the way in which the archetypes have been historically manifest and more importantly in the fact it will reimmerge in it's typical form. Opposed to the already manifest antitypical manifestation.
        As laid out in the teachings of Jesus which He has revealed in many of His sayings, recorded in the NT. This truth is seen in the form of cyclical Hebraic prophecy. 
    I.e  We are the individual blocks that make the new temple which contains the spirit of God. We are now called the body of Christ.  Etc. 
 
     The type/antitype structure can be seen in the patterns by whole, individual books, individual stories or chapters, single Psalms and verses. And even in individual sentences and phrases. I the very structures used in the quotes of prophets speaking for God.  Some of these patterns  are most famously noted in the relationship of mentioned details, from day to day(Yom), in the creation narrative. But also in what scholars have called (Hebrew) poetry, parallelism, and chaiasmus.  Compare each day and what God created AND made. Then see the major events in the whole Bible which could be defined by that mentioned each day. One day = 1,000 years. 
""Be not ignorant of this ONE THING. a day to the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years a day."".  A chaistic structure and important tool of understanding.  Be not ignorant suggests a very important piece of information, let's say, crucial Bucko.

I also have no clue what these thoughts mean or where they come from. That raised another question, if people meditate, they try to get thought free, sort of speak. What does it mean to be free of thoughts? And wich connection to what are people trying to establish or break when they try to meditate? But meditation is also a personal thing, to return to thy self, is it not? Meditation also has proven health benefits so then that must be something good i think. I only have no clue what the sacrafise exactly is there...time? for inner peace? have rest to be more productive theme? DOES THIS MEAN ANYTHING?????"

I am well-educated, sure, but I ultimately decided to have some great kids and stay home with them.  My husband and I are lucky to have been to afford that due to his hard work.  When the youngest started school we started our own business.  It is a service business and the work, on the surface, is manual labor.  That is the least of it, though.  It is work that is fulfilling because it helps others every single day.  And it is mentally challenging because every day brings a new problem to solve, plus the running of a small business and all the elements that are incorporated into that process.  It is nothing I am educated to do and I am shocked by how much I enjoy it (particularly the customers.

I've spent the last 6 years since then in an emotional and spiritual rut, with an indescribable tension in my chest that only went away in dreams. About 2 weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night with a voice in my head (literally, and this hasn't happened before or since- I'm not crazy) that spoke truths I hadn't realized before.

UgzO1tU9XPjxsNf77414AaABAg,Dualist,1526871747513,"In one lecture that I believe was part of his Maps of Meaning series he mentioned the psychology of dictators or people with otherwise over-inflated views of themselves. The lesson went a little something like: if you're in a position where you're spouting a bunch of ideas and one person tells you that it's really game-changing and important, a realtively healthy person would accept the comment graciously, if ten people start saying that, you're going to, quite understandably, start to think you're really on to something. If 100 or 1000 or 100,000 or more start saying that to you, chances are you're going to accept the role of savior that the larger social organism has thrust you into. It's the process that brought revolutionary figures who would later become the oppressors (Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.) into power.

Now, what Peterson has done by weaving together so many lines of thinking, distilling them down into very well constructed lectures, and sharing them for free with the world is to be honored and commended. Much of what he's said has helped me in so many ways. However, there are times I disagree with a small number of conclusions he makes, but those are minor points and not the point of what I'm trying to say here. I just feel it's an important disclaimer to add as to avoid a barrage of senseless noise consisting of replies claiming I'm just some anti-Peterson idealogue.

The letter he reads to open this lecture is to both equally beautiful and potentially dangerous (i.e. a snake). It was profound in the sense that the message given is clearly quite significant on what some would call a transcendental level. At it's source was an Ayahuasca (DMT) trip, and there are many people out there who I'm sure are skeptical or dismissive of anything that emerges from the minds of those under the spell of such substances. I'm not here to convince you of the case, personal experience has shown me it's the case, so I believe it, but I'm not about to open that can of worms in the form of a ""hard evidence"" display. For those of you who find yourselves on more or less the same page, you likely see the significance of such a vision. I myself was quite moved.

But there's a fly in the ointment here. I brought up the idea in the first paragraph up there because I want to remind others, myself included, to be skeptical of mass movements surrounding one person, even a wise one. I'm just fearful that Peterson chose to read said letter to an audience of some hundreds of thousands (judging from video view count and number of people in the audience chamber combined), as it could indicate this same complex within the Dr himself. I just hope if this is or becomes the case, he knows how to check himself, else it will be up to his followers to maintain enough agency to do that for him. To be clear, I'm not at all saying Peterson would become some dictator (his strict argument that these sorts of people/systems being absolutely deplorable and counterproductive to human flourishing being the obvious evidence for that), but he like anyone is perfectly susceptible to having quite an ego build up if he or we begin to believe he's anything more than a really smart bloke who through his curiosity found out some really cool and useful things and put them together into a very nice series of lectures (i.e. a good teacher), and then also stood up for his ideals when it mattered most (which is the act that gained him so much popularity online). 

Heard a really great quote once though I can't remember the guys name who said it, that ""Once you feel you need the teacher, you must leave the teacher."" Peterson has helped many of us in many profound ways and we should be grateful to him. But for those of you who might need this reminder, as I so often do, don't fall too deeply into adoration for one single source of information, it has negative consequences for both parties. Understand your individuated path and keep an yourself focused on it, but along the way stop to tune in to the things that can be manifested as useful tools as you go forward."

Maybe it's the world that's messed/screwed up, anti-social, hence sociopathic, etc.  Maybe you've already performed the prescribed examination and have critically found that your values are truly social, of beneficial sort, while what you're against, even if and when it's by a majority of the population, is far better for a healthy, sane, caring society, rather than an anti-social, ... one.  Consider politics and political elections, in the USA, Canada, and surely other countries.  Majorities, not necessarily majority in terms of the total populations but certainly in terms of people who do vote (I usually don't, for arguably good reasons), well, those of us who don't vote, for one reason or another, outnumber those who do vote and so-called win, and we,usually still and unfortunately end up with voter-chosen candidates who're so-called elected with rather extreme bias (to say the least) due to all of the corruption in the electoral process(es).  A guess is that some people eligible to vote and don't make this choice for ..., well, various reasons, somtimes differing from mine, f.e, for I just don't accept to blindly support a candidate who hasn't been well or seriously vettted, something that possibly, if not probably, isn't easy to do but which really should be, needs to be done; well, something real needs to be done to correct this system, to at least try to do that.  Just because a mass of people are a bunch of dumb, witless, blind, ... sheep, it doesn't mean that we all need to be or should be that way, for we'll hopefully never come to such a dismal sociaty.

UgzAR9NlQUoPGY_zfhl4AaABAg,Christopher Rivera,1521601360568,"Alex Kierkegaard: 
830. It is in fact equality that would have been unfair, since it would render the accumulated effort of generations ‚Äî both in the biological and cultural spheres ‚Äî utterly worthless and superfluous. And that's why equality is impossible in the universe, because as we'll be seeing shortly, the words ""fairness"", ""justice"" and the like are synonyms of ""universe"". ""What is justice?"", the super-children of the future will ask. And their robotic tutors will reply with one voice: ""The universe is justice"", i.e. what actually exists and occurs, and not the delirious vindictive fantasies of the defeated, conquered and enslaved. 246. The ""genetic lottery"". As if any luck at all had been involved in all the sacrifices that a superior line has made. The aristocrats thought the opposite way, and luck was furthest from their minds when cold-bloodedly calculating the decisions that would shape the fortunes of their families. For them, it was all about breeding. ""If you come from a good family you will be good, and seen clearly all good people come from good families"" ‚Äî this is what every last one of them believed in. Those who beg to differ and love pointing out exceptions (as if they disproved the rule) look only at an individual and his parents, myopically, as subhumans generally do. But take stock of the history of thirty generations, and it's all there. No room for ""luck"" there ‚Äî it is not due to luck that humans run the planet today instead of porcupines, and if a porcupine says to itself ""it was only due to bad luck that I wasn't born human"", the humans can do no more than shake their heads and laugh at the porcupines' hilarious understanding of evolutionary biology. 708. ... But see, you've already committed two huge errors so far, by making two unforgivable assumptions about the facts which, if they remain uncorrected, will prejudice the results. Because, for one thing, you have assumed that the two individuals were equal in all respects ‚Äî two ""people"", you called them, forgetting that there is no such thing as ""people"" but only an order of rank of lifeforms, and that the term ""person"" (or ""human"", or ""homo sapiens"" or whatever) is merely a shorthand that we use when we want to refer to any of a rough grouping of lifeforms that possess a relatively similar ‚Äî but far from identical ‚Äî DNA without having to list his DNA in full, or the complete DNA of every single one of them, if we are referring to the entire group. This is the first error that you committed, and the second error, which follows directly on the first, is that you have assumed that it is preferable to be the living guy in this scenario no matter what ‚Äî the ""lucky guy"", as you say ‚Äî which assumption, if the two individuals were indeed equal, would of course be true, but since they obviously aren't (since nothing ever is), is not ‚Äî not by a very long shot. For if the dead guy is me and the live guy any other lifeform in the known universe ‚Äî in the entire universe, even, known or unknown ‚Äî you can bet your ass I wouldn't by any means want to switch places with and spend the rest of my existence as him (as well as replace my entire past with his, of course, since that's what it would mean for me to be him), no matter how many tons of space or mountain rock I'd have been buried under. So you might suppose, along with good old Ecclesiastes, that everyone would foreswear himself and his entire destiny ‚Äî future and past ‚Äî in order to crawl like a worm a few more inches under the sun, but that's only because you are subhuman and bound to think like that. ""Judge no one blessed before his death"", said Solon. ""Judge no one blessed or cursed due to the manner of his death"", I retort, and there is no amount of calamities that could be visited on me which could persuade me to regard myself as unlucky, or anyone else as luckier than me. Health, strength and good fortune are created in this world through constant sacrifices, and I judge people's ""good luck"" or ""bad luck"" ‚Äî I judge their worth, that is to say ‚Äî according to how many of those they've made and how painful they have been, not to how many stupid events like the one under discussion they've managed to scrape through. I mean what's next, winning the lottery? Getting or beating cancer? Falling down the stairs and walking away unscathed? Even if someone went through all these scenarios and came on top in every single one he still wouldn't get anywhere nearer the biography of a great man than all the countless others who perished by them (and you can perish by winning the lottery, if you are worthless enough, just as well as by any other thing). And in the last resort a space rock falling on your head has no more to do with luck than your genes have ‚Äî it has to do with ""celestial mechanics"", i.e. the dynamics of our solar system ‚Äî and if you want to find a way to protect yourself from it you'd be best served by ceasing to ascribe everything to this ""luck"" and reading up on them instead. But that would require sacrifice, of course, of energy that you don't have to give (which, incidentally, is also due to genetic, evolutionary factors), so ""luck"", or ""fate"", or ""God"", or any other mindless word that requires none, will have to do instead, and always interpreted, of course, in such a way as to make you feel better about yourself. 
 Meanwhile, it says a lot to the rest of us about you that you see all these ""lucky people"" everywhere you turn, and that you regard the genetic process as a ""lottery"" in which you lost. As for me, I categorically reject ""luck"", and regard every single detail of my life as supremely meaningful, because it is precisely all these details ‚Äî bar none ‚Äî that have allowed me to be, and to become, exactly what I am. 
 In short, ""luck"" is an intrinsically reactive concept, because ""No winner believes in luck"" (Nietzsche). ""Heredity is a false concept; one's forebears have paid for what one is."""

However when I hear about psychological and evolutional background of relationships and human usefulness to others (and how some ideas and behaviours add to this usefulness) I'm starting to feel like it's just an utilitarianism and darwinism with no intristic values at all (nihilism that stops when it hurt your physical wellbeing and spare usefull ideas for the sake of human prosperity). It sounds rational, but not compelling. I don't feel encouraged when I hear ""hey you've got to stay strong so you can climb to the top of the social hierarchy and mate with the most attractive ones"". Also these hidden agenda behind myths, that makes them a mirror of first human's fears and adult's mental development does not make it better. Like I see cognitive determinants that make human thinking similar to robots (that were previously too sophisticated to comprehend, but then when solved, not really enchanting). And finally when you take all your life - hopes, feelings, up and downs and put them in that perspective it looks like only a chain of deterministic (or chaotic) events, that made us care too much.

Ugz5Pyy1sicfNC9kSvl4AaABAg,Toni Duval,1519182162566,"I think JBP got it wrong (at around 42 minutes) when he says the greatest sacrifice you can make is sacrificing your children. 

Your children's lives don't belong to you - their lives are not yours to end, and they are not yours to keep. You can only truly sacrifice something if it is yours and belongs to you alone. Therefore you are not ""sacrificing"" your kids lives when you let them die for your own benefit. If they are willingly (and knowingly) giving up their lives for your benefit, they are sacrificing themselves.

If you're going to be a parent who's ""worth their salt"", you bring a kid into this world knowing you're going to have to sacrifice YOURSELF (your time, your energy, your resources, your previous way of life, etc.) in order to ensure your kid lives, and hopefully you're mature/disciplined enough to self-sacrifice in such a way that'll also ensure that your kid lives a good life.

Your life is the most precious, priceless thing you have to give because it is only through living that you can come to possess anything of value at all. If you give up your priceless resource (human life) to preserve other human lives, you are validating human life as a priceless resource. However, if you are walking into situations where others (such as your children) have to lay down their lives in order to help you out, I believe that makes you a murderer at worst and an ignorant tyrant at best. The ones who are dying are making the sacrifice, not you.

UgwM4vx8cjkkg-SZuM14AaABAg,ThankGodÿßŸÑŸÑŸá UmmerFarooq,1519182165639,"2:18:00 - Jordan Peterson tells us why he won't say words because cannot imagine under what circumstance he would say it. That the hell of not saying the words is less than the hell of saying the words. 

Which makes me wonder, because you cannot stay in or go into the city of Mecca unless you say specific words. 

It is as if cities are a place where it is a must to be agreeable. While the wilds are a place where you don't find agreeableness. As far as full scale socialism, in how people must act and dress and speak, the City of Mecca is one place on the planet where you find an entire city of people become fixated on point. 

Not only that but the rule of hajj when it happens the men must wear certain clothes and shave their heads at the end. The women also must wear certain clothes but are allowed to wear one more or so cloth and they do not have to cut away as much hair. 

There's also work done and lots of walking between two points. And sacrifice. And climbing a mount. Begging. And circling a house. And throwing stones at a devils"
Ugxjg-C17RgZc_GlenR4AaABAg,ThankGodÿßŸÑŸÑŸá UmmerFarooq,1519182165647,"1:08:00 - I stopped watching the second San Harris interview of Jordan B. Peterson because Harris was so vile.

But in this video, my boss is teaching me great things about Sacrifice. That sacrificing a lamb is easy, you cut it. But sacrificing wheat is about seeing someone eat it. Until it is cooked, it is not sacrificed. Once you sacrifice a sheep the time on it to degrade starts. And it will stink very quickly. But the wheat will remain wheat for 7 or more years. 

So this leads us to realise that the sacrifices are of three types, health, wealth and time. The sheep's health went. Wheat is money. And the time between these two is what is unique. In the case of the return of Jesus, he is gone and his health at least is saved. I don't know if he took any wealth with him. But we will know when he comes back. What he has sacrificed is time. All that time gone. 

It is possible that when Cain heard sacrifice, he probably didn't hear it directly. Or he only saw Abel and left the wheat there on the altar. 
Over time, language changes. The greatest sacrifice of time is the loss of information or change in the state of words. If I held a wealth in my hand, it would last longer than my body. Over time, I would be first a baby, boy, adolescent, young man, man, middle aged man, old man, fossil. But the wealth would remain the same. The direction of time would remain the same. But over time words would change. And older son, and a younger son. The older loses more faster than the younger. But wheat stored for 7 years is what made Egypt rich. 

I could go on about Cain missing out on the reasoning. And Abel not being able to see from Cain's perspective and it ended with a herpderp Abel dying. Herpderp living is dangerous. It can get you killed. In health and safety, herpderpidness is bad."

The 'weeping and gnashing of teeth' as it relates to certain choices and judgments relative to our fellow man and to god and salvation. And the kinds of dilemmas encountered therein.

Its almost as if there is just a smooth development of a kind of absolute philosophy which can not be furthered by archetype or extension of imagination within its constraints. But the results, which then are extracted to their absolute limits form a new reality with new questions.

And so on, becoming smaller and smaller in context till it arrives in the seat of our volitional and moral consciousness and spirit. 

Since the constraints are as absolute as possible and no limit is given to reality, there are some seriously odd coincidences and contradictions and just as many paradoxes. But there are no true violations, as though each and every truth is self evident on observation of reality.

Its really amazing how we can see even as early as this story with cain and abel, the emergence of a kind of pre-scientific notion of the arbitrariness of reality and the pathway to success through truth.

I am not sure if many know but the most common definition of truth according to every philosopher that has studied or written on it is ""that idea which accords with reality"".

Remembering that in the old testament, god is the master of the natural and supernatural world and all of reality becomes that much more profound. And makes the statement 'god is the truth' a tautology."

It is fairy tales and myths, with great insights and stories about human nature, and nothing more. You've limited your sight to such an extreme by embracing such a limited and unknowing foundation as this.

No doubt these stories are profoundly deep, but I see nothing in here but culturally inspired wisdom and certainly nothing that provokes intimations of the divine (I only say this because I believe that belief in God is self-evident, but that it may not be the case that He has revealed Himself in any written text). It could just be the case, however, that this is how God did it -- something like: through the complex interaction between the natural world and biological matter there was produced a species that could manifest what's being preached to them, at the most foundational part of their being ( and perhaps Being itself), in the creation of a written text. In this case, we are God, and yet God is not us. We wrote the Bible, yet it is still ""God breathed"". But this might also be said of any number of religious texts. 

I can't really remember what Saint Tomas Aquinas' reason was for identifying the Ground of Being in the Christian God... Perhaps it was because of the profound name of God given by Moses to the Israelites in Exodus; that is, ""I Am who I Am"". And this can also be phrased like this: God is. And the Bible has its roots in Greek philosophy as it does in Eastern culture. The Upanishads, for example, are said to predate the Jewish Bible by thousands of years (although some still argue about this point), but Greek philosophy definitely predated Christianity, so there's no doubt that it influenced the writings of the apostles (given how popular it was. And we can see it, peppered within the story of Jesus from time to time). Still not convinced that God revealed Himself through the Bible though. But, then again, I'm really not sure what could convince me, so there's another problem.

Before having him, children were the things I avoided most; but interestingly was not avoided by them, mostly. Nowadays, whenever I talk about him, whether is a happy or sad thing, my eyes get wet and that giant knot in my throat leaves me speechless for quite a bit. @1:12:28, when I watched him talking about his son going through whatever he went through, the feeling that I saw printed on his faces translates (at least for me) as the same feeling that I have about my son. 

Never, in my entire life, I've done anything so right and so correct like having my son. 

I went from daily bitterness and lack of hope to a full joyful impression of life and its features. although I surelly have many more fears now than I had then - different fears: all of them regarding my son's future and none about myself. This is a crazy thing that I never thought I'd feel or be able to feel.

UgwYsAq02twg2tzWJvR4AaABAg,Justin Byrge,1513825384515,"I wanted to add why I think these lessons of life and psychology you explain are embedded into all these stories....namely why I think ancient people chose that type of vehicle to transmit the lessons. It comes down to writing and memory. Back then very few people knew reading and writing. Plus before writing even existed we needed a way to teach in the way writing does. And this was done by telling stories and the reason is because it's actually easier to remember things that have a story behind it. And the more outlandish the story the better you retain the information and you do this by simply recalling the stories. This is a strategy that memory champions use today to remember obscured amounts of names, numbers, sequences, etc. In ancient times everyone were memory ""experts"" and these biblical stories everyone tries to ""interpret"" are simply mnemonic devices. Thanks for reading all the way through if you did."
Ugzvz1EZonkY7gwURBx4AaABAg,Justin Byrge,1513825384519,"Great lectures and trains of thought. Here's one: It's emphasized heavily in the Bible and by Catholics that you don't question God. I think that what is actually meant is to not question the ""thought"" of God. We often wonder about where we came from and why, basically, who made us and all this reality possible and for what purpose. However, the truth is that no one can ever know the answer to those types of questions with any degree of certainty. But people across cultures and times INSIST on an answer, so the answer the ""wise"" people of the ancient past is essentially that God did it and that he did it because of his own will and who can know the mind of God etc. Offering the people this solution, albeit a questionable one, gives people enough so that the wise can teach what is truly of value, and those are all of the things you talk about in your lectures, namely relationships, dangers, etc. This is essentially a Buddhist idea as far as I can tell but evidently is much older considering that I am proposing that this is one of the lessons of the creation opening story in Genesis 1.

It occurs to me while Peterson's going through the Cain and Abel story, after listening to the introduction of this lecture, that Cain is an example of the perversion of sacrifice, and that seems to be the main theme of the story.

He, presumably, fails at his earlier sacrifices, and his resentment leads him to commit an act which very closely resembles ultimate self-sacrifice by killing his own ideal, both symbolically in Abel and by committing an act that he is likely to never recover from thereby killing his actual self potential. However, it is perverted in intention and method."

Interestingly, portrayals of Jesus in and approaching the 20th century are very similar to those of Odin, white horse, Sleipnir, etc. It ties in with Jung's idea of Gods as part of the collective unconscious, and the crowd existing in a symbiotic relationship with Hitler, telling him what they want to hear.

It seems to me, that precisely due to his power, he uses the Bible as merely the starting point for his own intellectual inquiry and his own associations, ending up with something far more profound than the Bible itself. He sees in the Bible the depth which may just not be there. Just because something was advanced 2,000 years ago, does not mean it is still the best source of wisdom now. The Bible may have some original or even revolutionary thoughts - for its time - but for just about every great issue discussed in the Bible I can think of quite a few better modern pieces of literature or philosophy. And just because the Bible may be the first one to bring those issues into focus (which I doubt because I know that every significant biblical story is rehash of some older mythology), it does not mean a thing.

The idea of psychoanalyzing biblical characters, I'm not sure whether it is original, but for me it is. However recently I came across John Steinbeck's story 'East of Eden' via its compressed version in the film starring James Dean. Steinbeck takes the biblical text in all its openness to elaboration and the brothers Cal and Aron are obviously allegorical figures based on the biblical Cain and Abel. Dean, well, you wouldn't expect him to play Abel but in Steinbeck's interpretation, Aron's goodness (Abel's goodness) is paralleled by hypocrisy. His persona of respectability with its simple 'moral' outlook is underscored by its own self serving delusions and insincerity. The story is complex but having been made aware of what JP calls the story's multi-layering, I really got into the whole immensity of Steinbeck's take on human character which expands on the simpler interpretation that JP presents. JP's version seems predicated on the North American success paradigm which does not deal with the parallel problems of acquisitiveness and greed which is the other side of the coin of jealousy. His marshmallow experiment also demonstrates the power of calculating self interest making the sacrificial sense much more complex. Jesus says it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever, my language limits me in this comment box but I do recommend anyone who finds these talks fascinating to go and have a spirit expanding experience via Elia Kazan's 'East of Eden'. It is also a way of appreciating what a fine dramatic actor James Dean was in his extremely delicate portrayal of Cal - the guy based on Cain."

The reason I wouldn't want to bring a child in to this world, is not because life is hard, not because they would suffer. That is life. 

The reason I wouldn't want to bring a child in to this world, living in the UK, is because the child does not belong to you, it belongs to the state. And the police will enforce this. The government could dictate that your son has to wear lipstick. If you say 'no he won't' the police will come, break down your door, and lock you up for 'child abuse'. I've used an extreme example here, but the idea is the  same.

Life is hard enough already. Parents aren't perfect and neither are kids. But the meddling of the state, the police, social workers, would make me want to kill, and I don't want to go to prison. 

When I see someone bringing a child in to this world today, I see someone that has ceded responsibility to the state. It's ok if you have a lot of money and high status. The police will leave you alone, the social workers won't interfere - for the most part you'll be ok. For a poor, low-class person, your child is at the whims of the power-mongers. I really feel for single Mums who got banged up and decided to see it through. Vulnerable, without backup, they soldier on. Probably not too many of them reading this. 

I'd wife up a single mum, and rear another man's child as my own, but I'm funny like that. I know the downsides, but I'm strong enough to overcome the personal and social drawbacks. It will never happen though. Society will dictate that.

There is enough kids in this world. They won't get nurturing. They won't get helped. But in the UK if you have a child now, just sign it over to the government and blue-haired cat ladies.

I'm all for helping those that are born in to this shit. But I won't take part in bringing them in to this shit. Not until I get massive wealth and power. Poor people get their kids stolen.

I see JBP having a distinct lack of 'theory of mind' on many subjects. It's ok. But on this point, it would behoove him not to be so sanctimonious."

With that content in mind, applying that to history, the aggressive people survived while the vanquished (read peaceable or perhaps weak) have been eliminated under the feet of the aggressive.  We are descendants of conquerors.  If a person experiences a time of reflection on our darker nature and we wonder why there is a monster within ourselves this is why.  Aggression is a predictor of survival throughout history and we are the descendants of millennia of survivors.  It would do people well to consider that each of us could respond like Cain killing our brother in jealousy.

The good Doctor knows these arguments are directed against those who see the Bible as literal and who in his words ""miss the point"". 

It really frustrates me when these arguments are misrepresented. It happens all the time. Someone makes an argument against X, someone who doesn't believe X says that the argument is foolish because they don't even believe X. Well the argument wasn't meant for you then! It would be more gracious to simply agree that X is clearly incorrect and that you agree on this point.

UgwYpvpDIS2GuprGs9J4AaABAg,Kevin Long,1503284609373,"Dr. Peterson, Brilliant. I love these lectures.  May I add a bit of interpretation of the Bible account of Cain and Abel.
Abel's sacrifice was pleasing to the Lord, because he followed the way shown to his parents. When Adam and Eve tried to cover themselves with aprons fashioned of fig leaves, (human effort) God gave them garments fashioned from the  skins of lambs.
This required the shedding of blood  to get the skins. (Fast forward to the words of John the Baptist ""Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world"". There is a verse in Old Testament ""Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins""  This part you may find interesting,  it has been preached that Cain saw how his parents atoned for their sins by sacrificing a lamb.  I was preached Cain imitated this act on his brother and slit his throat."
UgydjAkRQTgIZCXGH4x4AaABAg,Mimi Sardinia,1503284609379,"I just had a thought that the reason why Abel's sacrifice is better than Cain's is a question of sustainability. To kill a lamb means that lamb will never reproduce, it's usefulness comes to and end. Produce comes from plants and plants are far more reproducible - Cain sacrifices a bushel of fruit? There's still trees that more fruit come off of. Cain sacrifices a sheaf of wheat? There's a pile more wheat to get seed for the next crop from. 

Another point is also, what would people feel more about losing? A basket of produce or a pet? Having to kill and sacrifice a pet is easy to see as more emotionally affecting."

When the man toward the end talked of utilitarianism, what hit me is what always hits me when I hear the term.  

WHO IS THE JUDGE OF THE GREATER GOOD AND WHAT IT IS?!

If I am Hitler and killing off certain peoples is for the greater good and brings me joy in that I feel I have killed the enemy of the people, does not their pain become my joy?

If I am a communist circa 1919, does not the overthrow of those greedy capitalist lite folks bring me joy and their pain becomes my joy and the furthering of the working mans equality justify the means of change?

Those are just cursory blurbs, but it gets my point across.  In both cases, the ends justifying the means due to a so called moral righteousness that serves the greater good is on based on moral relativism, not a moral code that all, on both sides agree,

I believe it is wrapped up in this one quote

If someone succeeds and I do not, it HAS to be because they cheated or I/you then have to admit that I/you are not superior to them. So much of it really just is to re-enforce the idea that I/we/you are better than others. If the example of success is faulty then it isn't REAL and then we/I/you don't have to judge ourselves in relation to it and can maintain our own sense of superiority.

Given that even our ancestors monkeys etc. are pack animals the strong preference for pride (being right, superior, victorious etc.) vs shame has been re-enforced in the structure of our minds for at least a few million years, probably 10's if not a hundred million. Historically not only does not every tribe survive, not all of the members of the tribes that do survive survive, so it is VERY important to be higher on the pecking order, to even have a hope of a shot at reproduction.

The desire to be right and superior can even be seen in this comment, to show the person reading it that I some random guy on the internet am just as smart if not more than the man in the video.

They are seen as the opposite of the natural creation of human beings through birth. (which Cain explicitly attacked.) Also intriguingly is God's prohibition on harming Cain. One interpretation I've seen of these things, by the late Dutch art historian Hans Rookmaaker, is that God allows humanity to go Cain's way to seek an evolution out of human suffering through the arts and sciences.

At 1:20.00, I have decided to put what you said as a quote on my wall. ""Went through the motions but wasn't very happy about it.""  J. B. Peterson . I can find certain aspects of my life where it is applicable and didn't realize it. The other is when you spoke of your daughter.  I lost my daughter in Dec. of last year. She was severely mentally disabled. For me she was a Hero and I felt a moment of symmetry with you because I think, and I could be wrong, that in that moment your grappling with the magnitude of one who is suffering so greatly yet able to smile,  laugh and find joy. What a Hero she is!  With that said, I want to thank you for part IV in this series. My daughter for almost 25 years was the impetus to my desire to strive for, as what you may call, a noble aim. After loosing her and being introduced to you when you were on Louder with Crowder I thought maybe you had something to say that might help me ""sort myself out"".  I don't know if I can communicate correctly what you helped me to understand but I will try. Everything I ever did in the care of my daughter was such that if the day came that I lost her I didn't want to look back and wish I had done better. I believed it would allow me to have some measure of peace if she left before me.  I remember being humbled a great deal at the notion that maybe God gave her to me because he saw something in me that  I didn't and knew I could be the person she needed me to be.  I then knew that's the person I wanted to be. Losing her is a great loss and sorrow to me. There are so many broader and deeper things that I learned from her being her mother than loosing the child that I loved so much. Partly because of this I kept thinking now what do I do with my life. Who do I want to be? I have been cautious to grab on to any one thing because I know I am vulnerable to making a rash or desperate decision that could have very bad consequences if I don't think it through and stay self aware. I kept thinking what could I do that had as much meaning to me as what I worked so hard to do for my daughter?  The IV in the series made me realize I already am who I want be. I don't need to reinvent myself.  I reached the goal of the my noble aim.  I just didn't know it because I was looking for what I had already obtained and didn't realize it. Seeking to be better tomorrow than I am today is a never ending goal  and is not something that stops because I lost her.

The school system is worse-- it has been glorified babysitting for years, and it was invented by corporations who wanted to train workers in the early part of the 20th century.

He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, 18 even though God had said to him, ""It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."" 19 Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.-NIV     COMMENT FOR 1:10:00 to 1:12 bible reference as to why Abel's sacrifice was favored because of Abel's faith:      Hebrews 11:4 By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did.

And it's quite arrogant against those who are not able to have children or those who never got a chance to, typically men in the latter group.
¬†And the argument against having children that his client had, she didn't want to put children into such a horrible world, is of course a good one if you really mean it after thinking through it alot  and it's not just something you picked up from others. It's not a valid argument Peterson has there,  because so many people say the same thing it's not good enough. Just because many people mean the same thing doesn't make it false or worthless. 
I really respect it when someone come to the  conclusion not having children because they don't want to be responsible for the possible suffering, and that can be hard and lifelong in some cases. And that there are too many people in this world is also an ok argument, not true in every country but in total it is,and why not be one of those who are willing to contribute to a population reduction? Someone has to start, take on the responsibility. Isn't that what Peterson is saying in many videos, go for personal responsibility and not only focus on rights?

Himmler pretty much built the SS within the Reich. As well as the Nazi culture (as in their mythology, symbolism and superstitions). But near the end of the war Bormann was likely the only true authority left. Hitler having long since become a puppet leader. As well as a broken and defeated shell of the man he was.

I have to disagree with this statement. The proper meeting of the material and the spiritual has ALWAYS been an integral part of Christian doctrine. That's why the Savior of humanity is God incarnated into matter. That's why the early Church developed the Sacraments (which are considered to be spiritual realities enacted through physical realities).

UgjunxP65xwFZXgCoAEC,tntruther,1503284651938,"20 mins in I just want to point out that Cain also gave a sacrifice. 
Yes, he was successful but as the story goes, there was something wrong with his sacrifice. If we look at the overall theme of the Bible we can suspect that it had something to do with his motive, not the gift itself because (according to the theme) God looks at the heart of man, not his outside performance or stature. 
The REAL difference between Cain and Abel's gifts was that Abel gave as a result of a relationship with God that was already in place and healthy. He didn't want anything in return. It was a labor of love and (therefore) an expression (or outpouring) of that love. 
Cain on the other hand tried to buy Gods approval but God can't be bought anymore than you can buy a friendship, trust or love. A true gift comes from the heart and has no strings attached. A gift with strings attached is no gift at all but rather a bargain or a trade. A form of prostitution if you will. ...A form of slavery."

Ughq6PvjfAXE3ngCoAEC,Southern Israelite,1503284668882,"13 Reasons Why You Should Not Believe the Modern Theory of Human Rights:

1. The MTHR fundamentally makes a conflation of equality, and in this context equality under the law not equality of ability or equality of outcome, of penal justice with an equality of privilege and franchise.

2. Equality of Opportunity cannot be distinguished from Equality of Outcome. Money is an opportunity, in esse and simpliciter. If one does not have money, ipso facto, he has no opportunities.

3. Making humanity, in abstracto, the basis for equality of privilege and franchise, is literally impossible in Human Civilization seeing infant children are fully human.

4. Making a base standard intelligence/knowledge accumulation, the basis for equality of privilege and franchise, contradicts the liberal idea of relativism, nihilism and subjectivism where there is no objective knowledge.

5. Making an abstract theory of human value, the basis for equality of privilege and franchise, assumes the word value has an objective monolithic meaning which it doesn‚Äôt. The word is loaded with a mountain of controversies. What theory of value? The Marxist Labor theory? The Austrian Subjective theory? The Aristotelian Utility theory? Appealing to religion at this point and the Image of God will not work either seeing the Bible denotes man, not woman, as the image of God. Gen. 1:27, 1 Cor. 11:7. Appealing to the Soul will not work either as neither Science nor Scripture has discovered any such Dark Age
notion.

6. The MTHR view of Human Property necessitates the Communist view of children and the family. The traditional view is that children are the Personal Human Property of their Parents. Thus, if one denies Human Property, the Communist idea that the children become Public Property of the State necessarily follows.

7. The MTHR cannot justify or explain what a right is. How do we know about rights? Are rights things I can see, touch, smell, hear or taste? If not how do I know about it? Empiricists cannot appeal to innate forms because they believe all knowledge begins with sensation and thus Locke‚Äôs Tabula Rasa follows necessarily.

8. The MTHR denies the idea of hereditary imputation yet the advocates of MTHR use the concept of hereditary imputation often when holding white people accountable for their ancestors actions.

9. The MTHR assumes that choices I make cannot harm another person as long as I am not Physically attacking the man. This is an ignorance of basic economics and the Principle of Opportunity Cost. To forego is the same as to disenfranchise. One is either with or against another. There is no neutrality.

10. The MTHR states that, ‚ÄúLaw is the expression of the general will.‚Äù This is Utilitarianism and has been shot full of so many holes you can drive a Mack Truck through them. On this theory of Law and Morality seeing Nazism was the general will in Germany beginning sometime in the 1930s and following, then ipso facto, being a Nazi was the right thing to do. There are many other examples but I think the intelligent reader can grasp my objection. Moreover, does the general will have to be unanimous? If so, good luck with that one. If not, where does a Government or anyone get the authority to coerce someone else? By what right does a majority coerce a minority? Is the majority decision distinct from common good? If so what is the distinction? Thus, on the MTHR it is impossible to judge another nation because that‚Äôs Fascism but then the MTHR turns around and does exactly that in its judgment on Nazi Germany, the Antebellum South, etc.

11. The MTHR view of Freedom of Speech is simply Nihilism and as I already proved, if one takes a Skeptic or Nihilistic position of Philosophy, then he cannot distinguish Rights between and adult and a Child and his entire theory of Society and Humanity comes falling down.

12. The Social contract Theory cannot justify or explain what a ‚ÄúState of Nature‚Äù means, promotes a society with the ends being mere Commerce and thus is inherently Nihilistic and Corporatist; the Social Contract states that Civil Government is a deterrent from War, when the exact opposite affirmation is the basis of Anarchism(Strange that Anarchists are usually the biggest promoters of MTHR), which states that Civil Governments are designed primarily to make the rich richer through war and the powerful more powerful; the Social Contract is contradictory in its explanation on the origin of Human Rights. Do rights derive from the Social Contract or are they alienated and surrendered to the contract? Rousseau said both. Moreover, how does one derive the concept of a Moral Person, from Empiricism?"

For instance, things like Infanticide reduction theory, hidden estrus/ovulation and even the differences in sexual jealousy between men and women all revolve around concepts that parallel what conservative men (even most men) have been loathing about modern women. These scientific concepts describe why marriage is failing as only older (less reproductively valuable) 
""career"" women look for monogamy/marriage and are ultimately not worth the genetic investment. 

Especially since they continue to bar hop ""with the girls"" even when they are ""monogamous""  discouraging men from marrying them because paternal uncertainty is a biologically ingrained concern in men and, therefore, women who are out wandering around working or socializing are likely not a worthwhile investment (genetically) because the probability that they are impregnated when they are out of your site is high. If he described why men want young, fertile, obedient, monogamous, introverted women; he could help eliminate some of the mgtow he finds so reprehensible by virtue of describing what men expect genetically from women (and hopefully the women would listen in the same way that the men have listened to him)."

Anyways, i was very scared, I called out to my mother whilst in this unusual state, when i got to her room the dream ceased and i felt empty.
This dream happened again, and the same sleepwalking state occurred, this time the dream only stopped until i had vomited onto the floor. I hadn't had any experience like that since.
This dream was so terrifying, mainly because it was so conceptually challenging for my brain, I'm not exactly sure why though. 
I am certain this happened, although this happened a long time ago, about 8 years ago, I can still vividly remember it, it had such a strong emotional impression on me.

Ugg2oVbN8vm44XgCoAEC,Benjamin Love,1503284688052,"I've been thinking about this for a couple days - and I'm starting to conclude that the concept of sacrifice is one of the fundamental flaws in our thinking, which is responsible for a lot of the suffering attributed to religion, and mystical thinking in general. I love these lectures because it's the first time I've seen these concepts presented in a way that attempts to avoid mysticism. But I don't think the concept of sacrifice works without mystical thinking. 

My first takeaway was to think of sacrifice as delaying gratification. We don't eat our seeds in January, even if we are hungry - because planting those seeds in April will provide much more value. We ""sacrifice"" by suffering a bit now, because we know we'll be rewarded with abundance in the future. But can this really be called ""sacrifice""? If your time horizon is 3 days, sure it will feel like a shit deal. But you can only make the decision to not eat the seeds by extending your time horizon months/years into the future. And in that context, the decision is not a sacrifice at all - it's very self-interested. (aka ""selfish"")

Even sacrifice based in mysticism is self-interested. If you sacrifice a ram in order to please God, you're giving up something you value (livestock) in order to gain something you value even more (God's favour, or having your neighbors like you). You have a set of assumptions that lead you to believe that this course of action will result in more value to you - which is self-interested. 

If you've reasoned yourself into a ""sacrifice"" - it's not a sacrifice, it's a rational, self-interested investment. (Your underlying assumptions might be wrong, but the conclusion has to result in a net gain, otherwise you wouldn't do it.) The concept of sacrifice only makes sense when you're trying to convince others to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. 

The concept of sacrifice is how you can convince people of the good in military conscription, genital mutilation, suicide bombings, bloated government bureaucracy, nuclear weapons, concentration camps, and social justice tribunals. And communism, obviously. I fully reject sacrifice as anything but pure evil."

UggbBOG8nhmUWHgCoAEC,Jo√£o,1503284688063,"The Cain & Abel story:

Abel is a shepherd. Cain is a farmer. Abel's flocks are growing and he has plenty of food, so he's more attractive to the opposite sex and people in general (let's suppose that they and their parents are not the only humans on the planet). 

Abel works hard and sacrifices short-term pleasure for long-term success. Cain also sacrifices himself to ensure success but reality (God) doesn't smile to him as much as it does to Abel. Cain gets resentful. Cain's consciousness (God) tells him ""Maybe you're not sacrificing enough"". 

Cain says ""No!"" to his own counsciousness. His ressentiment becomes hatred. He kills his own brother because, in a sense, he sees himself as a victim of reality and it's just not fair that his younger brother is more successful than him.

That seems familiar. I can see this line of thought and behavior in other people and myself, as well.

Don't resent someone for being more well off than you. Sacrifice yourself harder or you may be destined to hide from the face of God and become a fugitive and a vagabond, roughly speaking."

UghTjuZhbwICnngCoAEC,Bee Dee Bee,1503284692683,"So I took a day to dwell on it and got some rest. One thing that I feel you missed is that, at least in the version I was taught, there was an emphasis on the bond that Abel had with the flock, especially his prized sheep that followed him about like a pet dog. Cain suffered in the fields is another point that was emphasized in my teachings. At a young age I came to the conclusion that God favors Love over Suffering, as was confirmed in my class. It also teaches the harsh lesson that Hate is born of Love. 

And an Acid Dream: I found myself in a dark tunnel traveling at tremendous speed. It was pitch black but the equilibrium was forced back as if I was falling and the hairs on my arms bristled as the upward draft licked of the sides of the tunnel. A faint green light appeared at the end of the tunnel and as I emerged I found myself upright as if I had come running out of a long train tunnel at full speed. It was an old growth forest, filled with massive pines and as I slowed it broke into a humid mountainous land, with thick canopy and thick tangled vines. 

I do not recall ever looking at myself, or functioning to walk as a normal human would, but at the thought of my own souls departure from the material world I instinctively drew a deep breath. That was how I realized the deep heavy and humid atmosphere surrounding me. I wound into a pass and a clearing in the mountain-scape as the sun seemed to break in through the clouds. The clearing where I came to rest was of the oldest sort; deep old growth, dead and felled trees scattered among massive old moss covered goliaths. 

It was at this point that I saw the cloud. It was more like a wisp of fog that had a bluish silvery shine as it moved toward the largest of the old felled trees. I moved to intercept it, my curiosity always has gotten the better of me. I pounced over, with a spring in my step I have not exhibited since I was young and spry. I was extremely short compared to the log, and I cannot say for certain if I was in a human form. With three bounds and a hop I managed to catch the top of the old felled tree but not without pulling loose a large strip of thick moss; and at which point the cloud seemed to turn as if to address me. 

Feeling that I had desecrated a hallowed site, I quickly replaced the dangling piece of growth and stepped on it slightly ensuring the roots found the decay they had been ripped from. I turned and faced the cloud from atop the log and it seemed to speak to me; but not as a human would articulate, it was as if it willed me to know what it was saying. It asked ""What are you doing here?"", with an energy that was familiar, as if I was speaking to someone who had known me from long ago. I could not recognize the vibe, but I felt compelled to answer.. in my typical defiant manor. ""Just exploring"" I said as nonchalantly as I could muster. I thought back to my body, upside down neck bent 90* stuck in between a couch in a room full of people completely sedated from drugs and unable to help me. 

The cloud seemed displeased and I thought to myself ""it is not as if I am lying"".. I was at the age in my life where exploring philosophy and the complexities of the mind was to be encouraged, and why shouldn't I be here if it is a humans duty to explore and unearth all of the mysteries that God created for us to find? At this thought the clouds irritation subsided, but it maintained a stern and ominous tone. ""You aren't supposed to be here"" the cloud communed authoritatively. Again my insolence got the better of me, and I looked around wondering where ""here"" was exactly. The cloud responded quickly sending me images of a short travel through the forest and into a beautiful Golden City. ""You do not belong in the city."" the cloud once again asserted what I did not deny to be a positive truth. ""Thank God"", I replied with a mischievous tone and the sense of my strong distaste for crowded places

At this almost all tension seemed to disperse and the cloud 'spoke' more softly, ""It isn't Your time, you have to help your friends"". I replied thinking to myself that in theory that is everyone in the world.. ""Which friends?"" The cloud, demanded cheerily ""ALL of them"". I immediately protested, ""But that is the whole world!"" The cloud laughed in approval, and the sun seemed to get warmer ever so briefly. With that the cloud said ""It's time for you to go back"" and before I could protest I shot back through the tunnel and into consciousness, springing up with a massive crick in my neck, pulling myself up from where I had slunk between the cushions. According to my friends I was unresponsive for about fifteen minutes, but I question their state of mind. Was a very interesting dream though."

UgjgbKQ77C9D23gCoAEC,Joel Fry,1503284692748,"Let's talk about Buddhism, since he mentioned it.  Here's a section from my blog:

The Buddha taught that the cycle of death and rebirth is without beginning, but he also taught that one should not accept something as truthful unless he sees that it is truthful, never mind that this kind of apprehension can be tricked and that philosophy is more than a matter of ‚Äúseeing.‚Äù He taught that the stream of consciousness is without beginning, never mind that it is impossible to ‚Äúsee‚Äù an infinite regress and that, if there is consciousness outside the brain that still hasn‚Äôt been conclusively proven. And every stream has a source.

The Buddha says (to paraphrase)‚Äîtruth is a raft one uses to get to the other side of a river. Once one gets to the other side, he leaves his raft behind. He overextends this metaphor. Truth is, indeed, a raft one uses to get across a river. But this is where the metaphor ends. The central obsession of Buddhism is letting go of attachments. NEVER MIND THAT HAVING NO ATTACHMENTS AT ALL IS AN EXTREME, AND THE BUDDHA ADVISES AGAINST EXTREMES.  So we are told to let go of truth. But in reality we retain truths in our minds. Letting go is not always the proper response. The Buddha taught that concentration is an act of single-point focus on a thought without ‚Äúclinging‚Äù to the thought. This is called Right Concentration. But as non-Buddhists we know that concentration often involves holding onto a thought so it can be examined. But this is not the kind of concentration the Buddha taught. So he taught what fit with his ideology.  

Add to this the fact that the Buddha says one should reach the point that he no longer experiences repugnance, and you have an absolutely batty religion.  Without repugnance you can't appreciate beauty and you end up with plug-ugly Buddhist sacred art.

I admit that not caring so much is ideal, i.e. ""He was without a care in the world.""  But I actually believe in avoiding extremes."

I must premise: I am not one of these atheists, but I have noticed atheists reacting with spite in response to his religious and mystical anchors and if you are one of them, I would highly recommend you read Albert Camus' - The Rebel. He is one of the existantialist, the one Peterson rarely mentions. 

In ""The Rebel"" he identifies the same fundamental problems: The death of god, nihilism, totalitarianism, depression, apathy etc. He also references the same literature: Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and The Bible for example. Camus also, basically, comes to the same conclusion as Dr. Peterson: Reduce suffering, live for the future, fight for justice, revolt against ideologues and crush nihilism. Only without God. I must emphasise, this will probably only be of tremendous use to those who do not jive well with the Christian/Jungian aspects of Dr. Petersons philosophy. But, if you're interested in Camus or existentialist philosophy, and you have not been introduced to him before, I highly recommend him. He is without a doubt the most underrated modern philosopher.

I agree with most of the things this man says but on a few matters he is just completely out of touch. It seems to me that he has a firm world view and no matter what phenomena he encounters he tries to depict and explain that according to the principles of his viewpoint without considering sometimes the possibility that it is only his subjective gloss coating on the objective reality.

We all begin life in the garden, with no knowledge of good and evil, with no knowledge of the world as it truly is, then you eat from the tree, your eyes are opened, and God curses you, you are expelled out of the garden, and then you suffer, you age and you die. Perhaps you bear children as well. That's what I see in the story. It also reminds me of the evolution of animals into man, that at one point for reasons that are not entirely clear, they eat from the tree, they gain knowledge, their eyes are opened, and they see that they are naked, they feel shame, they cease to be animals and clothe themselves in garments. God asks them why have they done this? And they don't really know, they just did it. But they are forever changed, they are no longer animals, and they may never return.

Ugifuhh1AYg3R3gCoAEC,Yossi Staif,1503284713222,"Last two questions of the Q&A, slightly edited.

""What are your thoughts on J.R.R Tolkien and his works, not just lord of the rings but The Silmarilion? Specifically when we were talking about Cain and Abel just now, and how Cain felt betrayed by god and was working his whole life essentially to spite him and set the path for the darkness in humanity, that‚Äôs almost exactly Melkor, which spawned everything evil in middle earth.""

""Well you know, Tolkien was a student of mythology, and the story of the hobbit is a retelling of Beowulf in a large part, and that‚Äôs a dragon slaying myth. So the reason that Tolkien, and Rowling for that matter, are so popular is they have done a very good job of making the old myths new. Now look what happened with the Marvel series, it‚Äôs the same thing, and Star Wars and all that. You can't not respond to these stories. Now you're gonna find them in one form or another and sometimes, well with the biblical stories for example, the meaning of the mythological content has become invisible, and that's part of the death of god that Nietzsche was referring to, but that doesn't mean that the stories vanish, because people have an eternal hunger for them. Now the problem, let's say, for them emerging in a more literary, or less sophisticated form, let's take the Marvel movies for example, is they are not surrounded by this articulated culture the same way the biblical stories are. So for example they are not surrounded by ""Paradise Lost"" by John Milton or ""Dante's Inferno"", which are works of unlimited depth. So, you throw away something of great value and reacquire it in a different place, with less value, perhaps with more comprehensibility, it's not a great trade. That is not a critique of Tolkien, it's not a critique on anybody who's drawing on mythological stories for their narratives, you have to do that in order to be a good storyteller. It's nice to go as close to the source as you can as well. And the over lapse that you describe is to be expected as well because when you deal with the mythological themes‚Ä¶ You see, the archetypes are at the bottom of stories, and so, if the story goes down far enough, it runs into the archetypes, that was Jung's claim, and I think he got that exactly right.""

""There is a passage in ""Paradise Lost"" where the demons are building pandemonium under Mammon's guidance, and they crack open not really the earth but hell, and they take out gold, and they build pandemonium, which is the most sophisticated architectural wonder  of all time, in Milton's nightmare. And this conception of taking material and turning it into a temple to one's self was interpreted by Humphrey Jennings, who was the founder of the mass observation movement, if anyone saw the opening of the Britain 2012 games. The history of the industrial revolution, he said, was encapsulated by this passage of Milton where you have demons building a temple for themselves out of matter, and that mankind in Milton's language was taught at moments like that how to do this, that they learned it first by this example. ""Let none envy that devils have riches in hell"". I see things in this, one is the Gnostic idea, that somehow the world itself that we inhabit is hell, and one that matter is not our true place of existence, but that is it somewhere platonic, and the Faustian bargain that people made around 1666 to get a world of stuff, of things and possessions, but by losing the soul.""

""Well Milton was definitely a prophetic voice, right? I think that that's a perfectly reasonable retelling of that section; it's also very much akin to the story of the tower of Babylon. See the problem with, God this is so complicated. See, one of the things that Jung said about the transformation of the first millennium of Christianity into, let's say, the second millennium of Christianity was that Christianity had promised something like redemption, universal redemption from suffering, maybe in the afterlife, but that was kind of a copout, let's say, because it didn't solve the problem of suffering here and now, although it did many positive things, Let's not forget that. It civilized people in a way they never have been before, you could make that case. At the same time there is this denial of utility of material reality that went along with the spiritualization of mankind in that first Christian length. There was value left in material, because it had been ignored. And so Jung believed that the collective unconscious, broadly speaking, began to be attracted to what had been rejected by the hyper-spiritualization, and started to question whether additional value could be extracted from the material, maybe as an adjunct to the spiritual. Because maybe true redemption was something like a proper meeting between the spiritual and the material, which didn't seem to be part and parcel of Christian doctrine up to that point. Now, maybe what Milton was warning against was a swing too far, right? And I think that Milton's point is well taken because one of the things that is worth noting is that you can be perfectly miserable in a house of gold, right? I've know very wealthy people, very very wealthy. See the thing is money just doesn't solve that many problems that people have. People wish it would, people that want to be rich think it will, and the people that want to redistribute money think it will. I know that there's nothing to be said for abject poverty, but the problem is there are many serious problems that human beings have that material comfort alone does nothing to address, or almost nothing. You can have a perfectly miserable life and twenty million dollars. And the buffer that the twenty million dollars puts between you and misery is‚Ä¶ Sometimes it's not even a buffer, it's a magnifier. So Milton would warn against the creation even of the idea of a material utopia, even in principal. Something Dostoyevsky also recognized as an error. You cannot solve the problem in that manner. And maybe the demonic idea is propaganda that you could. Now maybe there is a balance of some sort. I don't understand, if we were to build a city of god, let's say, well a huge part of the endeavor would have to be spiritual, and to me, a huge part of that would be, that it would have to be something predicated if not on truth, then at least on the willingness of people not to lie to one another. Without that, all the material wellbeing in the world is a fa√ßade; it's like gilding a corpse. And I think that part of what Milton was warning against, I mean, Milton was doing many more things than he knew of course because he was poetic genius of incalculable genius. """

2. Issac asks his father where the sacrifice is while en-route to the mountain, Abraham says ""God will provide the sacrifice"".

3. Angel of God stops Abraham right before Issac is slain.

4. Nearby a lamb is caught in a bush/shrub.

5. Abraham uses the lamb for the sacrifice, thus setting the precedent for (later) Israel to use animal sacrifices instead of human, which was common back then.

6. Fast forward to the time of Christ.

7. John the Baptist declares Jesus Christ the ""Lamb of God"".

8. Christ is executed (sacrificed) for the sins of all mankind, which ended the need to continue the practice of offering animal sacrifices.

The story of Abraham and Issac is a foreshadowing of God sending His son to make the ultimate sacrifice."

Ugh8PrdYcwaRs3gCoAEC,T. William Knight,1503284734832,"Dr. Peterson, the keys to Cain's ""rejection"" by God is in understanding the predisposition of the man. In the Feasts the fruit of the ground and livestock were both used, grains much more so even. So contrary to what some think, it is not the material sacrificed that was rejected. If not then Cain is directly rejected. Why? It is feasible that Cain already had discontent toward Able prior to offering the sacrifice. Later in Scripture we see that God tells us that when we go to the altar if we are out of ""covenant"" with our brother that we must go make it right with our brother, THEN go make our offering. Furthermore God says that He does not ""hear"" the prayer of an unrighteous man. Sooo... Cain was rejected because he had a grudge or somesuch against Abel, and it was his attitude that blocked God's approval. God cannot and does not approve of the gifts offered to Him while the giver's heart is impure and hates his brother."

Uggs614aJ6Hb9XgCoAEC,The Frisian,1503284737566,"In germanic mythology. Thor, the strong ""doer"" sets out in a boat to fish up and slay a dragon that is his enemy. In this boat is also a Jotun called Hymir. ""Jotun"" is a word that means something like ""devourer"" and all Jotun seem to behave like the children whom choose to devour the marshmellow instead of waiting. They act on their primal needs. The first creature in existance was an enourmous Jotun called Ymir. The gods (symbols for the human mind and civilization and order) slayed this Jotun and build the human world from his carcass. Some Jotun children were also created which interact with humans. Sometimes friendly, somtimes a troubled relationship, somtimes hostile.
Anyway. Thor succeeds in fishing up the Ocean dragon and gets ready to battle it. But the Jotun who is alsop in the boat doesn't like it. He fears that it will lead to a great struggle that he just doesn't want to deal with. So just when the Dragon breaches the surfice an right before Thor can hit the Dragon with his mighty hamer, the Jotun grabs a knife and cuts the line, letting the Dragon sink back to the ocean floor. 

Eventually, in the end of the mythology, Thor battles this dragon at the ""twilight of the gods"" (ragnarokr) and he does manage to slay the Dragon but he is poisened by the venom and after 4 steps the mighty god Thor drops dead. if only the Jotun had not cut the line when Thor was sure he could beat him..... but now it was too late. The dragon, circling around the world and biting its own tail, is also a symbol of time and Thor simply left the Great dragon on the bottom of the Ocean for too long. Thor grew too old and the dragon grew too strong, and now Thor is dead."

Perhaps Abel was 'too good', a virtue signaling lying asshole with no spine, and Cain sacrificed the thing he loved best in order to free himself and others from his poison.

Much of your interpretation of certain parts of scripture is mirrored in large part in the writings of those such as Manly P. Hall.  It seems there is far more depth to scripture (of any religion) than initially meets the eye when taken at face value. Many Hall insisted that there were a number of keys to 'unlocking' the depth of wisdom contained within; the study of psychology being one of them. Further, he insisted upon disciplines of physiology, anatomy, judicial astrology, numerology, and a couple others which don't immediately come to mind. In my own experience, these fields all seem to blend together in the most elegant, mysterious ways. This lecture on Cain and Abel reflects it perfectly--this story of two brothers, somewhere ""out there"" in historical time, that may or may not have existed, but in some way which exist within us. Also that our brain, anatomically speaking, is split into two 'warring' hemispheres, and that thinking in and of itself is a rather masculine dominant trait, thus ""brothers"".  I sometimes wonder at the imagery of the burnt animal offering of Abel, that on a psychological level it is the immolation of 'animal desires', immediate gratification of our desires that could be referred to. In any case, fantastic lecture. Thank you."

It warms my heart, so to speak to see a number of atheists who are interested, resonate, or find themselves agreeing with or even waiting for Professor Peterson's Bible series lectures. Imagine what the world can be if priests and preachers spread Christianity or shared the Bible in this way, or at least is tilted in this direction, man. There will be a whole lot less whatever-phobic Christians, less division and/or discrimination, and more people would be sorted out instead of being repulsed by the creationist and archaic rhetoric, and that's huge, man. The modern man will rediscover one of the best tomes of knowledge that can lead one to living a life with a purpose (not in the dogmatic, religious sense), and that's no bloody joke, bucko!"

I don't know.  I do like to consider that Cain's sacrifice itself was of a higher ""quality""  than Abel's.  What if?  For me, one aspect of this story Might be that sacrifice is more than a magical formula or protocol for insuring things will go well.  The painting of C and A offering sacrifices together on the rock: Abel is kneeling in gratitude; Cain seems to be working hard at something.  It reminds me of Christ's admonition to using God's name even to do good things, but  ""Get out, I never knew you"".  It's a strange parable about self-giving love. Perhaps."

If you believe Cain fails due to his own personal problems, and that it is ultimately his fault, and his malevolence is a product of only individual failure, then this would tend to lead to a free market conservative worldview - be like Abel, not Cain. Invest and work, and if you do it right, you won't be miserable and resentful and impoverished. But this is also seems intensely oversimplified. What about those who strive and remain permanently poor? Those killed in war zones? I know that a person who witnesses a drone strike or a police shooting would tend to favor Cain, because God has shot down all their sacrifices and rewarded them with death. This tends to bleed over into Job as well - if Cain remained unsuccessful all his life but chose to keep soldiering on, he would basically become Job. Is Job the proper manifestation of Cain? But then, aren't all these stories ultimately advocating for obedience and are anti-rebellion, anti-social reform? Can't we conflate Yahweh with the structures of market forces and tell everyone to behave like Abel? That seems like a false idol itself. A world of only Abels would be a world of fools who only love God because God has rewarded them. Abel does not seem as interesting as Job. But isn't Job also a fool? Is the aim of Christianity to take hatred and abuse and simply smile and 'turn the other cheek'? That seems like a beautiful type of faith. But also potentially pacifying, and unjust..."

Sure, that is a kind of sacrifice, but it can never please you, others, or life.

God may dole out fate with complete justice, but it would require reincarnation being the state of affairs. At that point, I'm all in on giving my heart and my soul to God. I'm not there yet, because I'm not going to pretend I see justice merely because it is possibly there.

Ugg4d0X30e1mt3gCoAEC,Timothy Kuring,1503284759314,"That marshmallow test presumes the people running the test are honest and that the children are stupid enough to trust them.  The world doesn't run that way.  There are a million cheats of every kind, and countless predatory, cheating, lying, and stealing people running corrupt and prejudicial systems everywhere. Thirty years and more ago I said and wrote of many of the things this professor is so celebrated for, but i was relentlessly attacked and punished by professors, and hated by fellow students.  I delayed gratification and did spectacularly well in school, but I found myself unemployable.  I kept my nose to the grindstone and did very well at my minimum wage jobs, but I was punished by managers and co-workers alike.  I tried trading stocks on line.  I spent countless hours studying markets until I had a trading system that would reliably wring money out of the market.  Suddenly, my computer kept freezing, shutting me out of every trade, even though I knew and could call the highs and lows of any stock to the penny.  It was like the way they kick people out of the casino when they learn how to count cards.
      Success is very reliable punished by the cheating system.  People either never learn that there is massive cheating in the system, or they figure it out and become cheaters.  There is no room for honest people and no promises should be believed.  The smiling liars who are promising more marshmallows are running Ponzi schemes.  The experiment was a test run for suckers, and they labelled those children as more intelligent because they wanted to select the suckers for the Ponzi schemes, which are really just more elaborate marshmallow tests.  Except the marshmallow becomes the fine job you are promised after you borrow an enormous amount of money to attend college, or the retirement account which will be drained before you can collect it.
       They also won't honestly tell you the extent to which prejudice will determine your future.  Another race or another sex will get preferential treatment for any school or job.  People with wealth and connections will be preferred.  People who are attractive and personable will be preferred.  Your character, your grades, and your effort will be given the least consideration of all things.
       However, the people who run all these cheating systems have a great deal of self interest in maintaining the pretension that they are meritocratic.
      Don't buy the lie - eat that marshmallow!  When the man returns, shake him down and eat the other marshmallow.
      That is the inevitable end of a cheating and lying system.
      We won't get fooled again."
UgjVaOqiPc-dhngCoAEC,WeeedyMcMeth,1503284759322,I so look forward to this series. I love it. I would love to be in a bible study with the good doctor. Is there a schedule for them coming out?
UghptqYt-hm8AngCoAEC,Sanno Ryujin,1503284759327,"I love your lectures Mr. Peterson, but just as a side note, I think that you sometimes engage in the pseudo-historical/theological analysis that has plagued the 18th due to Gerald Massey's comparative religion thesis when those connections with the more Judeo Christian religions have been debunked. Astro-theology is more in the realms of esoteric societies like Rosicrucianism, Free Masonry. and they usually teach the Luciferian doctrine of God/Superstition as the evil and Lucifer/Heylel/Intellect as the good entity in the mystical sense, when those are basically inverted values based on Satan's offer to Eve. 

Also, you made the connection of Set with Satan. While both represent the negative archetype on different religions, they share no epistemological connections.  Horus was the sky god and also god of hunt, not sun. Ra, his supposed grandfather was the sun. Horus had many stages that would eventually merge him with the sun. 

We're bound to project our own interpretations and that's Ok, but I think we also have to stay true to those authors' intent. There is a lot of esoteric and mystery knowledge in the bible that I could go on for days about as well (mystery of the kingdom, Christ within, Ezekiel's vision, Daniel's vision, fruits being an experience and knowledge, trees symbolizing a source of knowledge or experience).

Here's Dr. Chris Forbes on comparative theology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbFbJrr1-bY

Also, it's not a copout. Christianity nor Christ EVER promised that you'd have a relief to suffering in this life. He promised you to be reconciliated with and God, and also by extension with your fellow man:

Matthew 5
‚Ä¶44But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same?‚Ä¶

He meant to give us a new (actually lost) understanding that we twisted and missed about existence:

1 Peter 4:12-19 

Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name. 

It's about overcoming the world, it's vices, vain philosophies and attempts to control the human spirit:

John 16:33 

I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.‚Äù

Luke 14:27 

Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

Philippians 1:29 

For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,"
UgjhWuuHP9jzRHgCoAEC,hogensan,1503284759334,"In view of the anti- male attitude by government, its legal system and the main stream media. It is proposed that men never talk to a women except to ask to talk or be served by a man or supervisor.  If the supervisor is female continue to ask to talk to a male. The possible mention of the negative implications of talking to a women should be very brief and not discussed at length or preferably not mentioned at all. That is, to avoid sexist legal anti-male legislation, laws and attitudes, I request to talk to a male. Because of the negative consequences, only seek interaction with males every where. This includes shopping, going through check-out and even asking for a male in all activities of normal life. Phone calls could also be dealt with in this way. Avoid entanglements and keep it simple. You can be destroyed/ jailed by women though completely innocent. All proof of male innocence can be excluded from any trial.
Men are presumed guilty while women are innocent until proven otherwise. Women are very rarely charged with perjury even though documented at very high levels. As of now men's life can be destroyed by a lying women with no reasonable recourse by men. There are little in the way of consequences for women's illegal behavior. Government and its Legal systems are female biased now with a bureaucracy that will bankrupt you and waste your time for those less then very rich. Main street media should be looked at as government agents as they seem to be similarly biased and tow the government lies.

First: how would I proceed with the payment for it (I live in Serbia and we dont even have PayPal here, and Im not quite sure about anything else if its even here...) and the second thing Id like to ask would be: does it matter that english isnt my first langauge? I dont think I could express everything as it should be I guess? I dont know really :/ To give some context to the situation if its needed, Im almost 19 and I just failed to enter a college so Im pretty sure I wont be opening a bank account any time soon..."

Now, he has recently and often mentioned that he doesn't know what to make of the current situation, where he is riding this huge wave of positive feedback... But I just hope the temptation to try to make SOMETHING out of it without good grounds won't get too enticing.

UgjvwFUN_KHP7XgCoAEC,DEUSexPOLSKA,1503284775882,"Dear Professor Jordan Peterson,

I have watched your YouTube video about Biblical Stories - II - Genesis.

I hear that you're looking for informations about first chapter of Genesis in particular of Elohim¬† ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù

and how it's happended that it's plural. There is connection between composition of days in first chapter and gods in ancient Middle East world. This thesis assumed that Elohim is transcendence of 7 Gods and mix of them. I mean, Jewish God demands attributes from the other gods and create world as them. I think that pattern will be understandable

Day in Bible - Day of the week in English - Day of the week in Spanish -¬† Attributes of specific god - Planet dedicated to god - god in ancient times

First Day - SunDay - Domingo -Light - Sun - Helios then Apollo (before Titanomachy - Teya Hiperion)

Second Day - MoonDay - Lunes - Separation of >waters< - Moon (which controls waters) - Selene

Third Day - Tuesday - Martes - Dry Ground - Mars - Mars (in german mythology Tyr, so Tuesday)

Fourth Day - Wednesday - Miercoles - Planets and Stars - Mercury (cause he patron astronomy)

Fifth Day - Thursday - Jueves - Marine animals and Birds (sky) - Jupiter - Jupiter (or Thor)

Sixth Day - Friday - Viernes - Man and Woman, Love and sex, Animals - Wenus - Wenus, Freya


I would like to stop here for the moment after we come to the second day. No case that God said in sixth day ""Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it"" God said this in sixth day because it's a day of Wenus.

Second Day - Saturday - Sabado - Rest (but God not resting so Law) - Saturn - Kronos, Saturn

After creating world God is not resting. In orginal hebrew Bible he ""stop working"". Because Saturn is the god of the Laws as was Kronos in ancient Greece and as Anu in ancient Mesopotamy God is now creating a law for his people. That's why we have story of Kain and Abel and sons of Kain."
