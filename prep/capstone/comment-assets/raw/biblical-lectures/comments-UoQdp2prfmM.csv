If the EU/Eurozone is a manifestation of a modern Tower of Babel, why are the nation state then not also too complex? By the way, I disagree that this is what the EU is. Why isn't the U.S. federal system too complex, for example? Modern nation states are amalgamations of 100s of years of conflict and war, and are not, to me at least, obvious ""optimal"" unit of analyses/stability. At least not in their current 21st century form. Also, I suppose that you could take the metaphor one step further and argue that complex systems rise and fall as part of the cooperation between humans, in which case it isn't easy to see when, what and where the next Tower of Babel is. I suppose I am struggling with the idea there is some kind of optimal equilibrium or system state here, and a level at which we go too far. Empirical evidence seems to contradict this. Anyway, thanks for speaking your heart out this and all other things Mr. Peterson; you're saving the world, one sentence at a time!"

UgwqlC4KkwQ7padePfJ4AaABAg,jamie Russell,1532142235683,"Consider the idea of Christ's blood physically spilling onto the Mercy seat of the ark of the covenant. The container of the moral law, which was the ten divine atteibutes, spoken by God on the mountain, written by His finger, unlike the rest by Moses.
 ""34My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

35Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

36His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.

37It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.""

     We are now the temple of God, the body of Christ, the footstool of God, the container of the Holy Spirit.  

The heart of the man in Da Vinci's Vetruvian man, dwelling within the square and circle, lies upon the north hemisphere at 19.5 degrees. If one looks to Hawaii and it's historical vocanic formation and it's current active volcanic state; the largest mountain in our solar system, which is on Mars, Olympics Mons; the large red spot on the swirling gas giant Jupiter; the white spot on Neptune; all of these phenomenon exist at 19.5 degrees in relation to the planets axis from the equator.

     The ark of the covenant was 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cubits. Therefore it's surface area was 19.5 cubits.  
      Consider also the theory of the holographic universe principle. Which suggests the 3rd dimension is a projection of reality. This theory also says that the maximum amount of units of information are expressed, to it's capacity, on the surface area of a three dimensional object. (See Leonard Suskin on the holographic principle)"

UgwqdBwhU0pdNpjTx-94AaABAg,CarmineFragione,1529550243693,"There is always a weave,  a pattern of  design  to all the stories in the Bible,   and they match the inferences or relevance   of the six days story of creation  in the Beginning.    So there is a day of LIght,   First Day,   and all things relevant to light rule this day,  and play out.    The second day is about water,   third is about the land,  fourth is about signs in the heavens,   fifth is about the emergence of life,   sixth is about human history in the land,   having dominance and the seventh day is about  resolving or finishing the purpose of all works to enter a time of rest.      So  as a weaver of cloth the pattern is established  that works like the Dewey Decimal System  of  accounting of where books are placed on  the library  shelves.    And this logic or  rule of thumb seals or  presses upon  all further story telling,   to have the same  system of  beginning with some light,  some element of the water,  the  ideology of the land,   the  predictive signs of the cosmos,  the  arrival of  life,   the  history of  human politics in the  land,   including the domination of men over  all else in the environment,  and then  a  conclusion where all  feats and acts are repented of ,  end and  the entire realm  comes to a day of peace and rest,  where nothing further is done,  or sustained,  it all  dissolves into entropy.   
    So with this rule of thumb  rod of measuring or determination,   all  stories begin and end with this train of thought  and  each story seems to expand into embellishment of  minutia of details  but they all end the same exact way ,  it all  folds the tent and retires into the sort of  void  which was before the Beginning.    So the idea of a fabric of human story telling and the indoctrination of  culture all seems to follow the same  ""Marks""  and Cues, which  report  not some sort of a  written  history narrative,  but  an oral style of human  mouthing of story telling,   be it the  the Torah of Moses or the Bards singing about the  poetry of Homer telling about the Fall of Troy.      The mastering of   human  memorization technique amplified by enumerative  algorithms  underline the basis of all  works of  ""The Ancient Story Teller"".    And  out of the mouth of this Wise Man,   probably  a man too old to work in the fields or  fight in the army,   now  he sits in the village square  ,  baby sitting the children while the  adults do their daily work  , farming or hunting or  building ,   and  he masters the art of the  Ancient Story Teller,    where  in the  foundations of music,  art , theater,   prose and poetry,    he  is the voice of God,   he has his own voice,  he gives voice to the people and  in a  Divine Manner ,    he is One God,   the  Ancient Story  Teller,  but  complete worlds of  complex subjects issue forth from his mouth ,   through his  Divine Talent to be all and do all,   showing a constant relevant and logical  reason ,   that   there is a belief in One God,  but the One God   is as a Father ,  and is as the Son  and is as the Holy Spirit,   to  satisfy the transmission of intelligentsia  from   the old wise man to the young impressionable children  ,   without failure for thousands and thousands of years, of  impregnation the  womb of creativity with a  consistent thread of  cultural  shaping ,    doing so ,  without failure ,  without ever yet having any craft of a written language art ,   or   ""books"".       
    It might be that the use of books has devolved the powers of the human mind and imagination to  have lost  mental  powers of a higher grasp of the  nature of the mind,  and  thus the  impetus to grasp the divine nature of God ,  has been relegated to the  mundane practice of  book learning and rote memory ,  having not the Spirit that first opened the human mind to a world within,   revealed by the  Voice of God,  or as it was called  ""THE WORD OF GOD"".        The Teacher,   he is the God,   the Being of God,   bringing the potency of the Spiritual  Mysticism  into   the carnal  being of a  organism that   brings stories to life,   and  changes worlds.       To know God,  you have to act the part of God,  and  sense for yourself  the Divine  Person.       Rationally ,  God is the   communicae of the  generations ,   through an Oral  Tradition ,   and   God was  a man called ""The Ancient Story Teller""   And the written  Bible fails to impress upon the believer the literal  pathos of   zeal  for God,  since the  reader of books may never live the part of what he or she is reading.     But a man  who becomes the Actor,   may  realize the God.     In that pattern of experience,   the Teacher is the God,    and Jesus came to be the Teacher of a New Covenant,    the  Mystical  unseen force or power of the Spirit,   Incarnate into a Human  Man  who is a House for God,  he is Risen  above the others to be the Teacher and thus the Teacher  creates the future among the  children,   and  so He is their God.     3=1"

Why would He show us a path that leads to no where?  You are using God's teachings to help a hurting world.  But that is not salvation.  You cannot  synergize God into the religion of modern man's humanism.  God is not symbolism.  God is three.  God is one.  God is all powerful.  God is light.  God is truth.  God is life. God is love.  God is reality.  God is a person. AS real as you and me.  You are doing a tight rope walk across the Grand Canyon.  Jesus told Peter to walk on water to Him.  Peter looked around himself and saw the danger and began to sink, but Peter had enough sense to cry out, ""Save me.""  And Jesus did, but asked him why he had such little faith.   Jesus will make you stumble as you walk your tight rope.  I hope you will have enough humility and sense to cry out as Peter did.  Jesus is our only salvation. 

27 Then He *said to Thomas, “Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.” 28 Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus *said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.”  God demands perfection. Only Jesus was perfect.  We must come before God covered by faith and trust in the Blood of the Lamb of God who died to take away the sins of the world.  Being good is good.  But not good enough to become a citizen of His Kingdom.  Jesus is the narrow gate."

Ugw2fbn8FZmsVE3mAoV4AaABAg,Gray Yates,1524279855869,"1:41:00 Dr. Peterson describes the most important  thing to happen in the 20th century.
The way it looks, to me, is that we embody a lot of information in our action. Our action has developed as a consequence of imitating other people—not only the people around us, but, of course, the people around us imitated the people who came before them, and those people imitated the people who came before then, and so on, so far back that it’s as far back as you can go. So you embody these patterns of behaviour that are extremely informative, that you don’t understand, that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries. Then those patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination. Those figures of imagination are the distillations of patterns of behaviour. As the distillations of patterns of behaviour, they have content. It’s not you, that content. You could even think about it as content that’s evolved. Although it’s culturally transmitted, it’s content that’s evolved. And so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you. That’s what happened with Jung, and that’s what he described in the Red Book. That was what permeated his psychology—a psychology that was based on the presupposition that the fundamental, archetypal structures of religious belief were not pathological, deceitful, or protective, in some delusional sense, against the fear of death, but quite the contrary: the very stories that enabled us to move forward as confident human beings in the face of chaos itself. I think it’s conceivable that nothing more important, conceptually, happened in the 20th century than that."

Lastly Opinions Sought.
Round about 1:30:00 in, the difference between thinking in words and pictures.
I have this curious condition whereby I have no conscious awareness of an ability to generate mental imagery (a condition recently termed aphantasia I believe).
I have often wondered just how this impacts upon my ability to think, for example I am pretty useless at even fairly simple mental arithmetic and I used to reason this was down to not 'seeing' numbers in my head, I am am slightly more able with a pencil and paper. I believe that this may also be the reason that I rarely remember having dreamt, I do occasionally remember dreams and they are visual experiences but that only occurs a handful of times a year.
I noticed with interest that the show of hands poll indicated roughly 1/3 of the audience believe they think in words alone.
I notice too that many commentors to Professor Peterson's videos are inclined to be positive in nature and I therefore fell it safe to expose my slight vulnerability in this matter. 
So dear readers of comments I would like to ask a favour; if you would be so kind could you answer two questions:
1, are you capable of generating mental images?
2, do you use visual interpretation to grasp new concepts?"

Ugxj4ppjlMQYM9Fh53B4AaABAg,Tom,1516503871390,"PETERSON IS SAYING THAT GOD IS AN EVOLVED COMPONENT OF HUMAN NEUROLOGY?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Jordan Peterson is saying that God is a natural component of human neurology, and that this is a result of natural biological evolution.  Peterson is NOT repeating the old saying that God is just a ""figment of your imagination.""  Rather, he's saying that God is much more than a thought or a imagine in the human brain.  

Peterson is saying that God is NOT something learned from culture or constructed by culture or invented by humans (that's the ""social construction"" claim of Marxists, Postmodernists, Atheists Activists).  

Rather, Peterson is saying that God is actually a natural component of human neurology.  

He's saying that God is in our DNA.  

To put this in terms of computers, Peterson is saying that God is NOT software that is added to some or many brains, but is actually built into the hardware of the brain.  

Thus, I think Peterson is saying that we humans have always told stories about God (as found in the Bible, and in other myths and legends) because the concept of God is hardwired into human brains.  

And Peterson believes that this God thing evolved in the human brain in order to enable humans to survive, prosper, reproduce, and have offspring who survive and reproduce.  

For this reason, Peterson believes and teaches that acknowledgment or appreciation of God, and obedience to the moral directives of God, are just important in the current time as they have ever been in the ancient past.  

And this is why Peterson is so opposed to people who strive to suppress God (i.e., the atheist activists).  

Just to be clear:  Peterson does NOT believe, teach or suggest that God exists as a separate thinking and acting being, with free will, who lives eternally in a supernatural, transcendent realm.  Peterson is well aware that some people still believe in this old-fashioned concept of God, and he isn't particularly interested in leading them out of that belief and into Peterson's biological, evolutionary, natural neurological God.  He believes the old-fashioned believers in the supernatural, Biblical God still get all the survival benefits from natural, neurological God.  

Have I correctly understood Dr. Peterson?"

He really did  that.  Gee, can you believe it?  Half way through I was seriously waiting for it to just be over.

Oh and by the way, he's dead wrong about ""if you want to know how a rapist thinks"".

I just wanted to say that this video was posted two weeks after I had, for the first time, met a longtime online friend who mentioned she had a pretty severe case of this problem and was attending therapy due to it and managing it as best she could on her own. Everything in this video, down to the most exact detail, fit perfectly both how she described herself and just my own observations of one of her tantrums, which she restrained with an amazingly lucid observation of how everything rational I was trying to say to help her relax, was still not helping precisely because this disorder is so irrational.

I just wanted to thank you for describing this disorder so well, right down to the exact type of therapy being mentioned at the end that she is attending and is somewhat (though it is still a struggle) helping her control it so she can at least hold down a steady job and be a very warm and gracious person most of the time, if not all of it. I honestly disagree with you on a number of subjects, while agreeing on others, but this one through personal experience I can say quite certainly - you have it exact as to how much we currently know about it."

UgxtUmQSEzlCpDDQZ3x4AaABAg,Kelly Graves,1513825476660,"I am very curious, how would the use of LSD change a person when used during puberty. I used a lot of LSD as a teen ager. From 13-17, I probably took around 150 hits of acid, with 5-6 profound experiences. Most of the use occurred when I was 13-14. I have always been curious about how this could have effected my interpretation of the world, particularly since I was at the age when a person is forming these interpretations. I agree that my mind could be more open, but I would describe it as more flexible to possible realities. For instance, if some kind of catastrophic event were to occur, something like an alien spacecraft appearing in our sky, or something so bad that it would change the physical nature of the universe, assuming that our physical bodies could survive, most everybody would be in a complete state of fear and panic, they would not be able to function, but I don't think that I would. Something to do with the ability to accept a new realty, without too much anxiety. 
Another very strange phenomena concerning my experience with LSD. I can always pick out which people have also used a fair amount of  LSD after a small amount of casual interaction, and they can spot me as well. Now that may be due to the shared culture of the type of clique's that kids who had access to LSD in the 90's (most of the stuff was coming out of Berkeley, I think like 90% could be traced back to one professed there)  but I think it's more than that. It's fairly easy to asses what kind of a kid a person was while in high-school as an adult, but to pick out something this specific I think  has more to do with something else. When I try to identify what it is that alerts me to another person who used LSD (not the people who have tripped one or twice, but the regular trippers I guess you could say) but it is difficult to articulate. A shared wisdom, an easy going intellectual lack of naivety concerning humans in some way. A competence, but with cynicism. A confidence, a wisdom of some sort."

Stories of Templar going out, people venturing out, toiling, sweating, arduously to make themselves acceptable to God when one MUST ""ONLY"" believe that JESUS dying on the cross has washed our sins, AND THEREFORE MADE US ACCEPTABLE.

In itself it is a fundamentally wrong nothing as it stops you from striving to be more. However, it has it's truth in the notion that you have to discover the truths about yourself in your current state to be able to change them, and to identify those which are unchangeable and you have to accept as to deal with as they are. Burning topics for this are homosexuality and gender dysphoria. Unchangeable but necessary to accept in order to deal with them in order to gain some notion of a bearable, even positive life and to make conscious choices on thanks to their realization. However, discovering your laziness and lack of being and accepting that as is not do anything about it, that is one damn ticket to a life of hell you will not escape from until you do something about it, and you better do it now than next year or decade."

Because they can not implement any of the help, that is a therapist's job to figure out how to do, you simply can not.

On that note, it is not the case that ""borderline men"" are drawn to JBP's lectures, to the contrary, the borderline people, and mostly females, comprise all the social justice activists, fueling the victimhood, emotional feeding frenzies and attentionwhoring; while the men drawn to JBP simply lack the knowledge of the ability to reflect, encounter, seek out and beat the dragon if you will, and implement what they learned. They lack the ability, because they were never taught, maybe were even taught to do the opposite for the most stupid and wrong reasons, but can discover and activate these abilities. Borderline personalities, as JBP correctly states, lack the possibility to access or gain or otherwise implement to ability to implement almost or completely.

To me it seems that in general both sides, the female (nature) and the male (culture) in one being (""God"").

When Campbell was alive he had the deepest understanding of jung available, which was why he was selected to edit the ""Portable Jung"" as part of the the Viking Portable series. To attribute ""follow your bliss"" to the new age movement is as much a fallacy as to attribute Nietzsche to the uprising of hitler. This has been a recurring insult in Peterson's lectures. Perhaps he is trying to distance himself from the apriori arguments that have been put against campbells work and perhaps he is trying to make a name for bringing ""original"" content to the public sphere of knowledge. He dismisses follow your bliss but immediately brings up the Arthurian romance legends, of which Campbell spent years of his life studying and writing about in France and was one of the first people to study them from a psychological perspective.

His hier(arc)hical institutions aren't what made our lives superior to most that have gone before. Instead we can thank human ingenuity, science, technology, the extraction and manipulation of fossil fuels and chemicals, doing more and more with less and less resources, and discovering an electromagnetic world beyond our senses.

Literalism is not the orthodox position in Christianity, it's a fringe minority that has influence in some parts of the US (and probably some other countries, but I couldn't tell you which), but even then they're on the decline, at least in the western world.  The actual orthodox positions, such as Catholicism and East Orthodoxy, are not biblical literalist positions (and East Orthodoxy is quite mystical).

As Peterson points out, the doctrinalists are quite necessary for maintaining a proper balance.  There's a difference from the revelatory process he talks about and people trying to subvert or supplant the system, and right now there are a lot of people from the radical left trying to do the latter, usually out of political allegiance rather than any honest interest in religion."

I tripped several times probably once per year as a teenager to young adult. Near the beginning of my trip, my mind would come to terms with what corrections of deeds I was currently undertaking and make resolution to do something about it.
I was careful about who I tripped with too, limiting to only really close and trusted friends. I made the mistake of trusting a new person who was a friend of a friend. We all took the same amount, but he started to lose it thinking that we dosed him more amounts than us (which we did not) and then he just became more and more chaotic. He had some major dragons and demons to face and to look at them right in the eyes and being unable to look away from their gaze drove him crazy. Extreme paranoia.
I had never experienced that. It was one of the last times I did mushrooms. I can tell you that if you are at peace in your soul, truly honest, then it should not be a problem, but if you are lying to yourself, paranoid, anxious, bitter, or angry in nature--do not do it until you face your demons."

Petersons reintroduction of the old mysticism through a rational lense re kindles and satisfies to a degree that age old desire for the mystical by breaking it down in a way that makes sense. It's a very strong antidote to nihilism that I think could save civilization from complete philosophical degeneration. He's doing ""God's work"" if you ask me."

When companies grow, the productivity declines rapidly. Mostly because the number of managers per producing worker goes up, until there's more managers then workers. The most productive society is one where the scale of companies is limited. It enhances competition, it decreases overhead and provides the need to work together when bigger projects need to be undertaken. So it facilitates cross pollination of ideas. It's when companies grow out of control that cronyism and fraud start to get out of hand. The whole system grinds to a halt. The Pareto distribution also states that larger populations get more extreme distributions. That's why globalism and big business create these extreme distributions of wealth we see today. To ""trick"" the Pareto distribution, we need to keep populations small. Small business, small governments, small communities. And then make the small entities work together to create meta-Pareto distributions."

The current monetary system and the massive waste of wealth that bureaucracies create, is what's keeping people into poverty.
I can understand that you want to protect the system where you yourself are profiting from, but teaching people to be passive, not to revolt and except their faith, is promoting learned helplessness. Exactly one of the tools rulers use to keep everyone down. 
This is also the biggest problem of Christianity IMO. Especially when there are other groups in society that think  because they are decedents of Sem, they have the divine right to use others as their servants.

When we share natural wealth, we end poverty. When we share natural wealth, we don't allow more putting of pollution or faster depletion of resources than what most people think is OK.

This is the only proposal that would end poverty while also shrinking the animal-exploitation industry. (Ecosystems can sustain relatively large populations of plant-eaters, but only much smaller populations of animal-eaters.) Pollution fees would cause environmental impacts of that industry, of every industry, to be reflected in prices.

So basically it was meant to be a man-made Stairway to Heaven, that replaced the need to worship God and make the requisite sacrifices demanded by God to get to Heaven, and, once finished, would allow anyone (in theory) to get to Heaven just by walking up it. God destroyed the Tower in order to prevent this scheme from coming to fruition. But perhaps he did so not merely out a motivation of jealously guarding his authority; perhaps God also rightly suspected that the Tower would not be used to simply allow everyone in Heaven; instead the keeper of the Tower would no doubt wholly take the place of God and demand sacrifices and obeisance to be made to him to allow people to walk up it. Perhaps this new ruler would be far more greedy, unjust, and tyrannical, than God ever was."

If the text is any guide, Adam knew what death was before he disobeyed God. Otherwise, God’s warning in 2.17 that, “in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,” would have been nonsensical. Furthermore, during what we Christians call the pre-Fall period, Adam knew what the creatures in the garden were all about, including the serpent. He named them after all, and 2.19 says, “whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.”

When 3.7 says, “the eyes of them both were opened,” it begs the question, opened to what? People can speculate, and everybody does, it’s a free country after all.

But in the context of the story, as Genesis relates it, what their eyes were opened to that day was that the serpent was lying to Eve when he said in 3.4, “thou shalt not surely die” – which note, was the exact opposite of what God had said. And that they were, indeed, “surely dead” just like God had warned, being cut off from their former access to the tree of life.

Of course God recedes as the text progresses, that's no banner insight. Death makes everything recede into nothingness, starting with God."

UgiFujdShyruZXgCoAEC,dgreer,1503284738595,"Thanks for making these videos Dr. Peterson, I look forward to them every week. I recall you mentioned somewhere (it might have been in this video or another one) that Marxism appeals to the feminine because mothers tend to take up the role of ensuring everybody in the family has enough food to eat. These two ideas seem to connect and resonate with some people because Marxism is also about ensuring equal distribution and making sure everybody has enough. After thinking about it, I don't think these two ideas actually connect because I don't think mothers distribute food equally to the family. I think mothers distribute food appropriately. Simply put, boys tend to eat more than girls (especially teenagers) and from what I've seen mother's provide their boys with more food to facilitate their growth. Also if there's a child that's more active than another, regardless of gender, the more active child tends to eat more. And of course fathers tend to eat more than mothers. So when you say mothers tend to make sure everybody has enough to eat, I think that ""enough"" is not the same as ""equal"" but instead is related to the individual needs of each person. If mothers distribute food equally, somebody in the family is either getting to much food or too little. So when you mention that Marxism doesn't scale up beyond the micro level of a family unit, I don't think it works on the micro level either.  Perhaps what some people find appealing about Marxism is due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of what's really going on around them. What are you thoughts?"

It was as though I mentally stepped out of myself & could objectively see my life as a stranger might.  I have to say though, it is INCREDIBLY INTENSE; my last trip I felt as though I were losing my mind for the first 20-30 minutes.  As a result I became self conscious & told myself to sit down, shut up (for fear of sounding crazy), & ride it out.  In the end I endured, it passed, & I was granted insight into my life as a reward.  It is hard to sit still on mushrooms, so I forced myself to sit still & meditate, it was very difficult, but extremely rewarding.   
       I would caution anyone who wishes to experiment with mushrooms to do so in a safe environment with good friends, as well as to wash the mushrooms before consumption (they often grow on cow patties).  
         Mushrooms are NO JOKE & should not be treated lightly, they also last quite a long time so if you have a bad experience it will seemingly last FOREVER (not really, it just seems like eternity to your mushroom addled mind).
       Often people seek drugs as a reprieve from an unpleasant reality, but reality is AWLAYS there, you can not hide your head in the sand like an ostritch, it will only make things worse.  So I urge you, if your life is unhappy & you are using substances to cope, to try sobriety.  It is miserable at first, but pays off IMMENSELY over time.

DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A DIRECT ENDORSEMENT!  IT IS NOT!  My experience was positive, YOURS MAY NOT BE. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT & AS SUCH EXPERIENCES VARY WILDLY."

Instead of having meta-consciousness, these humans were constituted by what Jaynes calls the ""bicameral mind"". For bicameral humans, when habit did not suffice to handle novel stimuli and stress rose at the moment of decision, neural activity in the ""dominant"" (left) hemisphere was modulated by auditory verbal hallucinations originating in the so-called ""silent"" (right) hemisphere (particularly the right temporal cortex), which were heard as the voice of a chieftain or god and immediately obeyed.""

And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue. And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans? And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?""

Ugg0D5RpN4-X93gCoAEC,Saurischian Designer,1503284742602,"So a couple of things I'd like to mention. When Peterson. Mentioned that when God does something even though to us it may seem wrong we must assume he's right because he's god, that's the same line that the creationists and fundamentalists use to justify their pseudoscience and violence. I know he must mean something more complex than what he said, but he's got to be careful of how easily that line of thought can be twisted. Dictators use the same line. Even Nixon said, ""it's not illegal if the president does it."" Is it therefore not immoral if God does it? Does might make right? Is that what he meant. (Not trying to be a jerk I really want to know) As far as the devil being portrayed as an intellectual. I think this is because of religious communities shunning of reason and logic. Of course they would vilify that which threatens them, because the rational thinkers have long damaged religion (for better or worse) it's not strictly highlighting a danger in rationality rather highlighting the fact that religious leaders want sheep, not people who will think for themselves. Therefore you tell your sheep that people who disagree with the religion are Satan. He metions the dangers of totalitarian Utopianism in reference to the Tower of Babel, but isnt the end goal of the Christian myth totalitarian Utopianism? Just read revelation. The lesson here is that man is to be a slave of God not a ruler of himself. And I don't think that modern people don't recognize how important religious stories were we just also recognize the dangers of religious faith."
UgggA6IJNZcy_HgCoAEC,Verbal Learning,1503284742610,"As someone who has been diagnosed with a disorder on the autistic spectrum (NLD/NVLD = Non verbal learning disorder) and who lives in a special housing complex for people with diagnosis on the autistic spectrum and thus talks to pedagogues (i think that's the right term in english for a ""caretaker"" who's educated and trained/specialized in dealing with children/adolescentes or adults with disorders) and autistic people on an almost daily basis, i have to say that i can very strongly relate to the explanation Jordan Peterson lays out in this video of the struggle of people who suffer from borderline personality disorder. The idea that you have an intellect of sorts that allows you to see problems and come up with solutions, but failing when it comes to any resemblance of implementation. When you have these disorders (perhaps also very likely to be the case even for people who don't) you can end up with a body of knowledge but no embodiment of the knowledge, which creates this very frustrating experience of feeling the contrast between what you know and what you can do, and i think that frustration is bigger than having a problem and not being able to concieve of or imagine any solutions at all.

Because when a possible solution to a problem is outside of your own imagination you can't damn yourself for lacking the ability to implement what you see in your mind, although now that i'm typing this out i guess you can damn yourself for not even being able to conceive of any solution. So perhaps one isn't so clearly worse than the other, regardless though i think in the modern age of rapid information exchange that it's easier than ever before to find yourself in the position of ""i have all these possible solutions to my problems right at my fingertips but i have no idea where to start or how to even attempt the process of implementing any of it"" which creates very fertile ground for a feeling or sense of crippling insecurity of ones own character which can very easily become incredibly damaging to a person's mental wellbeing and i'm not exactly sure how to address this problem, other than trying my hand at some of the various tips that Peterson's lectures provide and while that is certainly helpful and has started a transformation process for me and many others i'm sure, it still feels far away from a cohesive and embodied philosophy of how to approach solving the meta problem of how to solve problems."

The purpose of criticism is to separate the weed from the chaff. It’s not to burn everything to do ground. The point of criticism is not to identify everything as bad, it is to separate what’s good from what’s bad, so you can retain what’s good and move towards it.   

37:27
Humility means you are probably not as smart as you think you are, and you should be careful. How can you be careful and do good? You try not to step outside of boundaries of your competence. And you start small. And you start with things that you actually could adjust, that you actually could understand, that you actually could fix.   

40:43
It is more difficult to rule a self then to rule a city. (from New Testament)

1:07:35
One of the ways of decreasing your anxiety about death is to increase the felt meaning in your life. It's good thing to know in a general manner. If it happens to be a generalisable truth. If you are terrified of your mortality, terrified of your vulnerability, there is always a possibility that life path that you are following isn't rich enough to buffer you against the negative element of existence. It’s reasonable hypothesis. And optimistic one, although a difficult one.  

1:20:00
Jungian clinical work is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the client, to conceptualize yourself as that which can confront chaos and triumph. And that's associated with ennobling with a consciousness and establishment of proper positive relationship between male and female.

1:34:30
Exposure therapy is a hallmark of clinical psychology. One of the things you do with people as clinician is to find out what they are afraid of. And you gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them. And that is associated with a hero myth. That is exactly the same thing. It's like: there's a dragon, it's stopping you. Then you decompose them into sub-dragons and have people take them on, and as they take them on, they dispense with a dragon and they gain the power of the dragon, it's like a video game.    

1:44:10
Where do you look when you don’t know where to look? For something you need desperately but have lost? Well each of the knights goes into the forest at the point that looks darkest to him. And that’s Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell. That which you fear and avoid, that which you hold in contempt, that which disgust you and that you avoid, that's the gateway to what you need to know.”

1:46:30
Beware of wisdom you did not earn. - Jung on psychedelics

1:49:10
Jung believed that we are dreaming all the time. 

2:22:00
Modern idea is that you are supposed to accept yourself. I think that is insane idea by the way, I can't think of more nihilistic idea then that, you are already okay. It's like, no you're not! And the reason you're not is because you could be way more then you are, so what you want to be? You want to be okay as you are? Or you want to strive for what's better?"

But just thinking for a moment is this account of biblical significance effectively showing that God was only 'discovered' from the point of view of the compilers rather than the events and characters (if they ever existed) described? In other words, we say 'God' now but going back in time (OT era) no such developed or elaborated idea may have existed in the minds of those depicted. So Adam and Eve may have experienced 'God' as nature - literally as the struggle to survive. Where is the room for dialogue with the divine or even the ideas of divine w/o some level of resources? Surely 'God' was then that force of man which was part and parcel of his survival strategies?"

They teach that ""Magic exists to serve man, never to rule over him"", by which they mean both the ability of magic to dominate the mind of a man and the evil of Magocratic societies. I find it amazing how much parallels one can draw between magic and ideas. If you think about it in the ""Ideas exist to serve man, never to rule over him"", for there is a real evil when an idea possesses a man so thoroughly that the man becomes a servant, a slave if you will, to that idea.

JP is not your typical double-minded fool. Stop thinking he is. He's obviously thought a lot about really difficult subject matter, and he's helping a lot of people right now. Is he getting everything right? Probably not because it's not like he's trying to decipher which Starbucks frappé is the best flavor. He's tackling the questions of our very existence. He is moving the conversation forward which is incredibly refreshing in this day and age. Stop fearing moving forward. If you're worried about this becoming a ""cult"" begin thinking for yourself what can you do to lead the best life possible. That is actually what JP is trying to make you do!!

UghcKNn5yt6wG3gCoAEC,Richard Elliott II,1503284752137,"psychotic inflation

It's written in the Bible ( Deuteronomy, I think) that Moses and God spoke together ""face to  face"" like friends.  Also, that Mose was a most humble man.  He would have had to have been.  Talking with God ( the generalized Consciousness ,as such) as a friend.  I envision this the way I might go next door to my neighbor's, barbecuing, kids running around, periodically stokin the fires, smoke rising, kickin back and  just talking with my friend.  Well, almost like this.

For the most part Mose was a pretty loyal and reliable mediator between God and the Hebrews +.  When God was ready to punish all the people Mose would intercede for them.  As Jung would say Moses saw himself as being in the soup with the rest of the people.  A humble man.  Except for the episode at Number 20 v 1-13. At Meribah.  

I think something like what Dr. Peterson describes around 1:47:00 thru 1:50:00 describes something that happened to Mose and Aaron.  Mose forgot he was in the soup with the people and took up the attitude that he embodied the power and holiness of the ""generalized Consciousness, as such"".  He stood separate and apart from the people in this drama.  As such, Mose and Aaron forfeited their destiny to physically enter the promised land.  Pretty serious.

This, I understand is also an occupational hazard for ministers, priests, and authority figures of diverse kinds.  Even political people. :)"

UgjW3SC3RGvnD3gCoAEC,Joseph Nusse,1503284752207,"So this kind of intelligent discourse about Christian Mythology, is literally exactly what Richard Dawkins has stated numerous times SHOULD exist in the classroom. Peterson does an amazing thing. He makes non-religious arguments for his religion. He literally interprets Christian texts the same way a Literary scholar would interpret Classic Greek myths. It is unfortunate to me that most people on, let's say the Right, of the religious spectrum, fail to realize that Dr. Peterson is literally doing a much better job than Harris and Dawkins to prove that Religion is not true, but an evolutionary necessity. Where I have a problem with Dr. Peterson is where he tries to assert a kind of eternal inflexible narrative of the human condition. I think the our species is far, far, far more adaptive, and socially adaptive than Dr. Peterson tries to portray. Further, I think he has yet to make a single Christian argument since Christian theology is all mythic literal, and Dr. Peterson never does anything other than assert Truth through allegory and metaphor."

UgihnitcJqQBJHgCoAEC,Amisi Kiarie,1503284752258,"I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Dr. Peterson. But he's just unbelievably ignorant when it comes to the Abraham story, it's pretty disappointing to see.

He's trying to wrap his mind around the Bible, instead of letting his mind be enwrapped by it. His mistake is analogous to that of a man who dips his toes in a pool and concludes that it is too cold for his body. Dive in and see! The psalmist tells us to *taste*, not *think*, and see that the LORD is good. (Paraphrase of Chesterton's scientists vs poets.)

My guess is that he's read the Biblical narrative (as a whole) only once or twice, but certainly not more than three times. These confusions dissipate the more you expose yourself to the text.

For example, this BS about ""the disappearance of God."" Anyone with the smallest fragment of Old Testament knowledge will tell you clearly that Genesis to Ezra contains the history of humanity and the Earth, but focused on the establishment of God's people, the Israelites, and the story of their rebellion, exile, and return. Genesis tells us about the creation of the world then the patriarchs. Exodus to Deuteronomy gives us the escape from Egypt and the Law. Joshua is the fulfillment of the first part of the Abrahamic covenant, Judges is about the failure (i.e. refusal) of the people to obey God and hence the need for a king. Then Ruth, 1 Samuel set the stage for the good king, David. We see Israel following God under David, but through his greatest failure comes ultimately the division of the kingdom. But we also see God's promise to establish an eternal kingdom through a descendant of David, so the history of Israel becomes the history of the kings. Hence the focus of the following books, but ultimately no king is found, the nation fails, and goes into exile. Then the final books narrate the return after 70 years. The only possible excuse for believing that there is such a thing as a (sub-textual or conspicuous) disappearance of God in this narrative is lack of exposure, ignorance. Because anywhere you look, I mean seriously just read the ""Introduction to Genesis..."" and like sections of any study Bible and they will tell this information to you plainly."

UgiGWiCe5Io9o3gCoAEC,Sem Nome,1503284763089,"Does the brain really make a distinction between images and words (or sounds, smells, etc) in the ""shape"" of its biological processes? Can't they just be interpreted in an equivalent way to subsequently be converted to electrical signals? Functionally is there really a difference between a brain more used to conjure images, words or whatever (besides - the size of - the areas involved)?

It seems to me the way we output back our own rationalizations of our inner processes may obfuscate what really happens, which may be simpler than the way we divide and categorize all these methods of shaping information to describe the mechanics of the inner workings. Just like in a computer, you can have all insanely good and complex graphics and programs but it all can be simplified to multiple functions performed in conjunction, on a lower resolution, made by processors. All these basic structures can produce immense forms of imagery and complex systems, that are all constructed with the same building blocks and processes. Which makes me think that the way we shape information into thoughts may be ""re-programmable"", and that in general our present methods are either innate and evolved or acquired and causal, or a mixture."

""Christians often ask why God does not speak to them, as he is believed to have done in former days. When I hear such questions, it always makes me think of the rabbi who asked how it could be that God often showed himself to people in the olden days whereas nowadays nobody ever sees him. The rabbi replied: ""Nowadays there is no longer anybody who can bow low enough."" This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Church and his Bible between himself and his unconscious; and the rational intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche""

What it can also mean, and obviously will mean to someone having achieved a fair amount of awareness, is to accept your flaws as being flaws: accept that you have a shadow that requires cultivation and awareness. It is not possible to see one's own darkness without a willingness to accept that it is there in oneself at the moment--this requires letting up on the self-moralizing for long enough the see the truth. In this sense, ""accept yourself"" is an absolutely essential part of furthering self-awareness. There is a big difference between accepting flaws as being present reality and condoning them.

Moralizing leads only to denial. This in no way implies that morals are not important. This is a key idea that cannot be overstated."

UggumR0owYm12ngCoAEC,Bite-sized Bible,1503284782762,"Concerning Noah's nakedness, there is some indication that we are reading some sexual euphemisms here. For example Leviticus 18:3 warns the Israelites not to do what was done in Egypt and Canaan (remember that Canaan is the only son of Ham mentioned by name in the Noah's nakedness story). Lev 18:6 describes what exactly they shouldn't do: ""Do not approach any one near of kin to him to uncover nakedness...you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother..."" and Leviticus 20:11 ""The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness.""

One possible interpretation is that Ham entered the tent to see Noah unconscious and unresponsive and he perhaps thought him to be dead. Ham, not being the firstborn, decides it is now possible for him to take what is rightfully belonging to Shem, become the leader of the family (and the world) by doing what Lev 20:11 prohibits.

This explains why Noah curses not Ham, but Canaan, as Canaan in this situation is the child of Ham via his mother. This explains the nature of Noah's ""curse"" on Canaan as well because Noah takes Canaan from Ham's custody and gives him to be raised by his brother(s) in order not to be unduly influenced by the wicked Ham. This also explains why Canaan is mentioned at the very outset of the story.

But that's just one theory..."

UgiraFK9zqYflngCoAEC,Gabriel,1503284786296,"Jordan, I know you got enough on your plate already, but just to call your attention on a intellectual mistake you did on the recent Steven Crowder interview:

You must differentiate the alt-right from the alt-light. Crowder, Sargon, Milo, etc... and all the ""Kekistan"" stuff, is more alt-light related. The alt-right is a much more solid intellectual movement: Jared Taylor, Richard Spencer, Kevin MacDonald, etc.

I think you misunderstand the alt-right because you are viewing it only the surface of it. The reasons you are indentified with the alt-right are two: (1) you are actually aligned with alt-light, which is basically anti-SJW, and people confuse alt-light and alt-right easily, for bad reasons; (2) almost everything you say is very welcomed within alt-right thought - as you said it yourself, the alt-right is trying to ""rescue the father"", and they love you because they see you as a key piece in this goal.

Your objection of the alt-right is a misunderstanding of their ideas related to collectivism and individualism. Would it surprise you if I said that the core of the alt-right today are former-libertarians with extremelly high openess? And they are traditionalists at the same time? The thing is, the current thought within the alt-right finds collectivism and individualism as complementary. As you say: the goal of the society is to give rise to the divine individual. Exactly. The thing is the alt-right recognizes that the sacred individual can only arise when society has its collectives in its proper places - that includes recognizing sexual and racial differences and its consequences to the way we should act. It means recognizing that while there are individual exceptions, a society cannot give rise to the divine individual if on average these individuals are not individualists.

The ""anti-semitism"" within the alt-right is also more intellectually profound than you give credit to it. It is not anti-semitic in a crude way. Many of the most ""anti-semitic"" thinkers within the alt-right actually admire some intellectual jews like Murray Rothbard and Ludwig Von Mises. Most of the alt-right is just aware of different ingroup interests jews, and other racial groups, have within western (better called european) societies.

I wish you could study the topic a bit more before making statements about it. I really admire your content, but you're making the same mistake with the alt-right that you did with the MGTOWs, you're not very informed about it yet. 

Dig deep into it, and don't trust mainstream sources that talk about it. A good test to see if you trully understand the alt-right is to see if you can watch Murdoch Murdoch and Walt's Birsmark cartoons/parodies and see if you completly understand their humour and ideas."

In Western philosophy, phenomena has traditionally referred to things as they appear to us, as contrasted with noumena, which signifies the transcendent. The word 'divine' refers to the other worldly or transcendent and thus tracks the meaning of noumena. Thus, while the 'phenomenology of the divine' sounds neat, it's mostly nonsense."
UggMOymHA5iATXgCoAEC,Michael Aardal,1503284786379,"Psychologist Julian Jaynes, in his 1976 book, THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAK-DOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND, wrote:

""The Loss of the Visual Component""

""If only because its sources are so chronologically diverse, it is somewhat astonishing to find the Pentateuch consistently and successively describing the loss of this visual component. In the beginning, He-who-is is a visual physical presence, the duplicate of his creation. He walks in his garden at the cool of the day, talking to his recent creation, Adam. He is present and visible at the sacrifice of Cain and Abel, shuts the door of Noah's Ark with his own hand, speaks with Abraham at Sichem, Bethel, and Hebron, and scuffles all night with Jacob like a hoodlum.

But by the time of Moses, the visual component is very different. Only in a single instance does Moses speak with He-who-is ""face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend"" (Exodus 33:11). And another time, there is a group hallucination when Moses and the seventy elders all see He-who-is at a distance standing on sapphire pavement (Exodus 24:9-10). But in all the other instances, the hallucinated meetings are less intimate. Visually, He- who-is is a burning bush, or a cloud, or a huge pillar of fire. And as visually the bicameral experience recedes into the thick darkness, where thunders and lightnings and driving clouds of dense blackness crowd in on the inaccessible heights of Sinai, we are approaching the greatest teaching of the entire Old Testament, that, as this last of the elohim loses his hallucinatory properties, and is no longer an inaccessible voice in the nervous system of a few semi-bicameral men, and becomes something written upon tablets, he becomes law, something unchanging, approachable by all, something relating to all men equally, king and shepherd, universal and transcendent.

Moses himself reacts to this loss of the visual quality by hiding his face from a supposed brilliance. At other times, his bicameral voice itself rationalizes the loss of its visual hallucinatory components by saying to Moses, ""No man shall see me and live . . . I will put thee in a cleft of rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen"" (Exodus 33:20-23). 

The very conception of a cupboard called the ark, for some tablets of written word as a replacement for an hallucinogenic image of a more usual kind, like a golden calf, is illustrative of the same point. The importance of writing in the breakdown of the bicameral voices is tremendously important. What had to be spoken is now silent and carved upon a stone to be taken in visually.

After the Pentateuch, the bicameral voice retreats even further. When the writer of Deuteronomy (34:10) says that no nabi has been like Moses ""whom He-who-is knew face to face,"" he is indicating the loss of the bicameral mind. The voices are heard less frequently and less conversationally. Joshua is more spoken to by his voice than speaking with it; and, halfway between bicamerality and subjectivity, he has to draw lots to make decisions."""
UgiR6X7v2PJgnHgCoAEC,Nick J,1503284786388,"I'm wondering if Jordan Peterson has any criticisms about Modernism. 
Postmodernism goes so far beyond an already present problem of Modernism (similarly Marxism, while claiming to be anti-bourgeois, was actually post-bourgeois, a worsening of the problem it sought to fight, because it retained the obsession with money, just in a different way), that what we need to do in order to separate the wheat from the chaff would be to look at what it was about Western culture that was great before the Protestant revolt and the French Revolution and the ""Enlightenment"" and humanism and so on. 
It was putting God first in everything that made for a glorious Catholic Christendom of monarchies. Modernism shifted the focus toward man first--and postmodernism just does that in a worse way.
I think that is the key to having full gratitude for what makes the West good, while being readily willing to point out that the West is yet full of evil.
