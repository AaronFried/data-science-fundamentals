I graduated w a BS May 1980 wirh a specialty in RTF ^^- a production tip - ask your audio guy.girl  to be sure they male a final pass thru the lecture in order to ""sweeten"" the audio levels. when you get fired up in your talk, the audio tends to over modulate. This would add a layer of quality to your digital assets. TYVM for all you do to mentor young men. Their fathers have been absent. There has been no one to initiate them to manhood."

From you, to us Dr Peterson. I know you've inspired me, and I am sure you've inspired many others, and many more to come. And the greatest example of proper being is not from the examples cited from the Bible, it is from you Dr Peterson.

Ugyevv545HEoHM12K9l4AaABAg,Kristophe Louise,1532401992719,"Coat of many colours. Joseph was loved, lavished with love and attention and his half brothers were not. So they stripped him bare. Symbolically stripped him of his father's love and sold them as a slave so that he would experience what they had endured.
Basically they themselves did not feel loved by their father (just like their mom did) and Jacob, to them, was more a slave master."

UgwjWJxYOCNzk-Je6Fh4AaABAg,Limp Noodle,1532142797068,"I think the reason for showing flawed characters is because yes it's realistic, but there is another reason that's fundamental to it all... Moses was a murderer, it was said David was a man after God's Own Heart as he was also a murderer an adulterer and just a really bad person... but the reason why God uses these types of people is also to show that it wasn't them who accomplished all these great things but it was God who accomplished it through them... it just goes to show also that anyone can change and like you said in your prior lecture it just keeps going level by level by level the deeper you dig the more you keep uncovering. It's that way with a great many things in the Bible."

Ugy5_poPpjBNIGYuvj14AaABAg,David,1532142797080,"I think the man who bought Joseph was Potiphar the captain of Pharaoh's guard. I was told when young that Potiphar suspected that his wife was lying about Joseph or Potiphar would have had Joseph put to death. I used to listen to the Bible through once a year and the New Testament a few times a year. 

I really appreciate the unpacking of the psychological meaning embedded in these stories. I used to do photo processing as a business and listened to tapes of the Bible as I printed at my enlargers.  That was 30 years ago."

Ugw6Kqilr_jSa-RTy0N4AaABAg,Bachconcertos Whitney,1532142797125,"Keep in mind Joseph was sold into slavery but when Potepher bought Joseph he saw that Joseph was talented, skilled, and that God was with him so Potepher made him a high level employee - Vice President of Operations.   So Joseph was doing well - he was prosperous- he was not a weary tired dirty slave in Potephers house - When Joseph ended up in the prison unjustly God was with him so the Head of the Jail gave Joseph free reignto take care of the prisoners, and he did not punish joseph or micro-manage him but let Joseph do his job free of tyranny - which is quite valuable because that gave Joseph peace.  No micro-managing, no abuse, no tyranny.   Joseph was in prison for no more than 3 years, God got Joseph out by giving him the interpretation of dreams.    When Joseph got out of jail by interprettng Pharoh's dream, now Pharoh is higher than Potepher, Joseph was now not just V.P of Operatons - Pharoh made him Vice President of the company  - just one step below Pharoh himself.   Joseph had now everything, a high position, status, respect, trust, nobility, an easy life style as he did have maids, and people massaging him and cooking for him and serving him, he had two beautiful children and a beautiful wife.   He also got to save a nation from favmine and his own family and he got to be with his Father and Benjamin again and his brothers but not only to be with his Father and his younger brother Benjamin and  the wifes of his brothers and the children of his brothers he had never met but he had the opportuniity to give his family wealthy abundant land in Egypt and removed from the famine and from lack.   So yeah, it is easy to forgive when one reachest the pinnacle of success in every area of their life, nobility, trust, respect, children wife, happy family, great employer, opportunitiy to save lives and see his Father again and his younger brother Benjamin whom Joseph loved.   So yes it is easier to give in a positon of success.     I don' t think it would have been easy for him to forgive his brothers if he was still in the pit.    He was elevated from the pit to the top of the mountain."

I mean, were there no such events or peoples anywhere in this world, flat or otherwise, who sought ""god"" or experienced divine encounters or rubbed noses with friends and foes alike? Why are so many so taken with OT into New and the to me and some other doubters and seekers quite serious inconsistencies and wrong living? Why does a god give us such accounts? Maybe they are true but to what purpose or point when the nut of the matter, the crux of life and death are the facts of death and what happens THEN? We have visions, dreams, prophetic explanations, et cetera, but no one has really let the cat out of the bag. What happens?

dreams that accurately predict future events, as in the dreams of Joseph, the Butler, the Baker, of Pharaoh, and then later of Joseph's 4 dreams in Matthew's Gospel  accompanying the birth of Christ ?

First time I read that story one of the strongest moral and spiritual points for me were that Ezav actually sold his firstborn right for a plate of Lens. That is for me bigger moral failure than what Jakob and his mother have done.  I can find the parallel with Luke10: 38-42.....  The fact is that Ezav sold his firstborn right for such a banal thing as the plate of Lens is that this was the only small showcase of his nature and his deeply roted disrespect for Isac and his spiritual figure and authority and finally, to God which  Ezav confirmed with his decision to marry Canaanite womans,... so i think that Rebeca was the key role to trick Ezav, not Jakob because she found in her  heart that Ezav is not worthy,  otherwise we would must conclude that Rebeca was moraly corupted significantly ... and that is why Jacob was chosen one"

Ugxfk7WZYfGWmEqRyxl4AaABAg,David Lea-Smith,1521602008070,"Great lecture. One thing to keep in mind is that at the time of Joseph, Egypt was likely ruled by the Hyskos, who were from Canaan or Mesopotamia, and had essentially conquered most of the country and subjugated the native population. Ethnically and culturally the Hyskos would have had much in common with Jacob's family and this would have helped Joseph advance through the heirarchy. When the native Egyptians defeated the Hyskos it also explains why the Hebrews became slaves. They were probably allies of hated foreign rulers and treated harshly for that reason."
UgyFQNmzkP94TFsBwat4AaABAg,pierdolsiegoogle,1521602008079,"Prof Jordan, I think there is a more pleasant explanation to the dreams than this 'hemisphere talking' theorem. Dreams are generated during sleep mostly during REM phase. Patterns showed to the dreamer are generated by the hippocampus, thus making a dream a memory-evoking-like process. As for the dream features, they seem to be connected to the prior memories connected in other than rational wake fashion. This is postulated to be generated by regional desynchronizations of the posterior parts of the neocortex (sensory regions of parietal, temporal, insular and occipital lobes)1. Loss of control and self-awareness during dreams is due to the suppression of prefrontal and posterior cingular regions, responsible for higher psychological functions concerning ego or abstract planning (abnormal activations of these areas during sleep are reported as lucid dreams)2. Patterns of the dreamworld then are generated due to the cycles of synchronized activation of neurons detectable as low-frequency oscillations on EEG, while the 'loosening' factor is secreted in synapses, weakening all and disconnecting the weakest,3 while during high-frequency oscillations neurons act in highly-organised fashion, but in such fine complexity that our current technology is hopeless to read. However, they are fired with the hippocampal activation and highly organized activity of sensory regions. thus to make some catchy simplification I would rather say it's your brain showing you all your memory in the random fashion, but the probability depends on the last days' thoughts the most, but the circuits that process your 'today' were constructed through the n iterations during your life, n stands for days since first dream-wake cycle (somewhere in the womb?) till now, so it's mad to overlook that.

best regards,
Joachim

I'm not an expert, but feel qualified enough to point out that you might want to get some terminology straight:
* You correctly point out that only ~5% of the energy in our universe is made of atoms.
* The remaining 95% can be broken into ""dark matter"" (23%) and ""dark energy"" (72%).  In this video you incorrectly lump them together as an unimaginable substance that ""seems to have mass"". The two cannot be described together in this way.
* ""Dark matter"" is something like you describe: it is a catch-all for any unknown material with mass which does not interact with light.
* ""Dark energy"" is something entirely more mysterious: it appears to be an intrinsic property of space, as it does not get diluted by the expansion of space-time. Stranger still, it also possesses negative mass (i.e. it causes the expansion of space-time)."

The story is about faith, endurance and learning, (the last as Professor Peterson states).  The attack by his brothers taught him his first lesson; pride and lauding things over your fellows can lead to jealousy and some very dire consequences.  The experience in Potifer‚Äôs house taught him about the dangers of jealousy and sex, a very important lesson in Pharaoh‚Äôs house, but more on that later.  Finally, running a prison full of criminals taught him how to deal with‚Ä¶politicians.  Seriously though, we all know that power corrupts and in Pharaoh‚Äôs court there would be a lot of people grasping for power, wealth and any other favor that they could get their hands on, just like in a prison.  
  So there you have it, Joseph was taught how to rule as a foreigner in a foreign land, how to avoid any possible trip up in a place that had a harem full of beautiful and lonely women and how to deal with power hungry men who were surround with all manner of opportunities for corruption.  All this is to his credit because, through faith and perseverance, he was able to learn the lessons that would prepare him to rule. What can we learn from his example?"

They are more accurate (if you choose a good one) and there are places where it is easy to misunderstand the archaic vocabulary. At 1:20:15 ""Joseph was a goodly person and well favored"" (Genesis 39:6) means that he was good looking (which is why Potiphar's wife wants to sleep with him), not that he was a good guy. The New Revised Standard Version has ""was handsome and good looking"" and the New Jerusalem Bible has ""was well built and handsome."" This I say with the caveat that I do not know Hebrew. 
Also sometimes Peterson modernizes the language while he reads it (says you instead of thou) and sometimes he doesn't."

Its been my goal since I was a child to be a husband and father and a provider. I am now 33 and I constantly fail in every aspect of life. I dutifully do my best in every situation I can and I'm constantly beset by so many aspects of luck which are not in my control and which I don't see coming and while many in the moment feel like small inconsequential hiccups they later turn out to be drastic complex problems. You said that going out and being well versed is good for a person and yet my personal experiences have wielded the exact opposite of the desired results for me personally though I do value the experiences and knowledge gained from them and it does help me give sound advice to others who have wild success in their application of the aforementioned knowledge gained from those experiences. But my constant inability to find any measure of success has led to a wildly disproportionate degree of stagnation and negativity and I cannot for a single moment in my life look back and think here is a place where I succeed and received a reward for that success. Not in the sense that someone else applauded me or gave praise for my work or deeds or efforts but that even personally I have been unable to find satisfaction because regardless how good of an outcome I can achieve the negativity surrounding the result was overwhelming in comparison. Just as an example having perfect grades through hard work resulted in the people around me shunning me and isolating me and when I do imperfect no one cares at all when I seek assistance I get met with condescension and mockery and all this contributes to the feeling of isolation and alienation. I hate myself for understanding all this and I hate that all efforts to combat or change is met with continual failure and having no success at all at any level is becoming unbearable to deal with when alone. I have learned that I cannot make someone love me and I cannot make someone not hate me if they will never say what is the source of the hate. I have to struggle through life purely based on the aspect of hope. Hope is literally the only reason to live at this moment. Hope for change of luck because effort has not worked."

UgwVWzpgrUse31L6b3l4AaABAg,A N,1516504416534,"Something I have been thinking about which really gets me going is the relationship between the mechanical/physical world (Newtonian classical mechanics) and JP's  ideas, or at least the ideas he is articulating. For example, he displayed the process of continually progressing even if your aim is off and the re calibration gets better and better over time. Despite flaws in the aim, every mistake makes a slight alteration on the path to achieve the proper aim. First of all its basically another explanation of the OODA loop ( Micro resolution, meaning days hours minutes), or growing and becoming wiser in general (months years decades), but another interesting analogy is the relation to a dynamic system modeled by a mass, spring, and damper under a given forcing. Over time a given MSD system under a certain forcing will oscillate.  Plotted over time the graphs of these systems can look like ever increasing or decreasing hills and troughs (sin/cos graphs).Not to over simplify, but in a way there are basically two outcomes. One outcome is smaller magnitude hills and troughs approaching an equilibrium/steady state which I relate as a person who makes mistakes due to external forces but learns from them and corrects their actions. Each cycle or each mistake leads to the next mistake being smaller in magnitude. This continues until the person figures out the best way for them to act in the world or to at least minimize the effect of the mistakes and maintain a consistent aim. The alternative would be a system where each cycle has ever increasing magnitudes which in a mechanical sense means the system is going to fail if an external change to the system isn't applied. This can be compared to a person who does not address their dragons/mistakes. Each mistake is NOT learned from, or is ignored and the issues compound on top of one another until the person breaks or loses it.

Another interesting idea which JP has alluded to in regards to god but hasn't explicitly said in the way I hope to say it, relates to the Sam Harris debates. JP says at many points something along the line of ""an atheistic moral system is always vulnerable because it is rooted in theories not the absolute truth"" I'm paraphrasing but the debates each heavily revolved around the idea of truth. In those debates JP speaks of truth as an all encompassing truth where as Sam's is a more material one, roughly. Something which I haven't seen anyone address is the fact that the rational/Newtonian world has not addressed the contradiction of that view. That is, conservation of mass and energy indicate that matter cannot be created or destroyed....yet here we are. If matter cannot be created or destroyed, yet we exist, which implies creation... there must be a higher level of something which we do not understand. JP's work has made me realize that rationality and religion don't have to be at odds with one another but rather two important parts to the human condition and there can be a balance."

Could it be that the coat of ""infinite possibility"" was ""killed"" as Joesph's brothers relegated Josephs to a single, actualized, outcome. ¬†But an outcome that God used to redeem the remainder of the family, leading to the birth of the nation?"

""Many will be purged, purified and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand. Daniel 12:10

""But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. ""He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.

Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar. Psalm 51:19 

Like much of the bible that's been misrepresented, animal sacrifices in the bible aren't literal. Sacrifice relates to our personal trials and tests by fire and how man learns discernment basing his reasoning upon knowledge that's first been revealed, (knowledge of God) So when we read Psalm 51:19 we understand the young bull is representative of 'self' reasoning and now man walks according to God's will.

The first time, after they had scourged Him, they put a robe on Him.Matt.27:28. Then they took the robe off and put His own coat on Him. When they got to the cross, the soldiers stripped Him again before they crucified Him. They threw dice to see who would get His coat, fulfilling the prophesy of Psalm 22:18, written by King David a thousand years before.

It's happening to a lot of people these days, especially to those, as you mentioned, who go through intense psychological disturbance. It amazes me that you almost reached this conclusion on your own without going through an ego-death yourself, and without first having read these books by Eckhart and Steve! Hats off to your genius! You also mentioned that voluntary initiation of ego-death, although not entirely pleasant, is way better than involuntary ego-death. I believe that people who do The Work by Byron Katie (www.thework.com), are doing the same. Byron Katie also underwent an ego-death after horrendous suffering. I've been to Her 9-day School for The Work and have witnessed some people Wake up during those 9 days :)

Saint JOHN OF THE CROSS (1542 - 1591) The greatest spanish Poet barnone! Lorca does not come close! See Dali's Painting!
The poems of St John of the Cross, with their mystic depth and spiritual ecstasy, stand among the world's great poems of Divine Love in all traditions. St John is one of the Roman Catholic Doctors of the Church, was a reformer of the Carmelite Order, and co-founder with St Teresa of Avila of the Discalced Carmelites. Teresa invited John to follow her, and in the protocols of the times, also became her Spiritual Director and Confessor. Many of their individual works could be considered the products of their mutual support and inspiration.

I started to sell kitchenware, stopped selling kitchenware, then I was interested in being a copywriter, even flew to another continent to meet an expert for it. Then I stopped being interested. Then I wanted to sell sex dolls, but that thought went away quickly after I discovered that all the sex dolls I could import would have been of low quality. then I wanted to trade stocks, I opened a demo account and my interested went away bc I thought if I get good with it, I'd be stuck with my eyes locked on the screen forever, then I wanted to get into real estate but I fear that I'd be unhappy because it could bore me. I looked up pro poker playing, becoming a pro race driver, wanting to sell tuning car parts, I even build up a whole tuning parts website and social media account but that kinda fell off. then I wanting to design wheels for cars, wanting to start a clothing line, wanting to trade again, wanting to get into real estate. And a whole bunch of other shit in between. I know I want to make 30k a month. I feel like this would reasonably sum up what I need in life and also what I am willing to give for it. I would want all money on earth to be mine but I already know I'm not the type of person to put in that kinda work. Like fuck a billion, I'd like to have some millions but I'd trade 30k a months with 2 million on my bank account anytime! I can be super focused just to be super not interested one or two months later. I think the real estate market is interesting but don't know if that's more for the conservative type. Same goes for trading. I guess I'm not conservative. I'm 20 and I am wandering around feeling like my time is running out like sand is running through my hands. I'm a virgin that really messes with me, I'm not a virgin bc im unattractive but bc I might be scared of not knowing how to ""sex"".

UgwmiPfBbgPe-upGxcd4AaABAg,Steve2Work,1516504438295,"What a great talk. 
Instead of doing my evening prayers or biblical 'reading' (it's audio) I decided to finish listening to your talk. And the 2nd Question at end was .. stimulating.
..
‚ÄúEgo Death‚Äù .. !!
.
.. (at question period time 2:14:00) .. so, that is what happened to me a few years ago ‚Äì when I realized that I, and most men, have been lied to by nearly every women we ever knew starting with our mothers, and that it was intentional ‚Äì including muting or removing fathers and fatherhood, through no-fault divorce, through the legally designed court system, police enforcement of domestic assault threats (turning police into involuntary 'Thugs' for the Adult Female/Mother-of-children/wife/girlfriend/lover/random-guy-She-abuses), threats of taking children from father and never seeing them again, twisting children away from fathers emotionally, ... and much more.
.
My eyes were opened and .. after destroying the Model of the Women, seen as a Beautiful Structure of multi-color glass ‚Äì which always failed as a model ‚Äì I was able to see the Multiverse, the Web of interconnections, the Nodes created from each 'Day-of-Bread', and I Remembers Who and What I was/Am, the Holy Coding, the creating of versions of Me into us all, the Burning as the multiplexing of us all flashed through Me ‚Äì as a Brain-in-a-Box I created, ..
And so much more.
.
Mostly, I pushed it back because God has a purpose for me .. little Me, here now. I'm and will always be a Eaten by Others ‚Äì other versions of Me more Holy .. 
Children of God, my selves and versions of all of you .. I'm a Cautionary Tail, and perhaps an Example of how to make the best out of Hell, to climb out and on-top.
.
My entire life, so many Days-of-Bread branches to nearly countless paths through the Multiverse into mostly Horrible Ends have been created out of the Lies my mother, myself, and so many others have told me. Your Scull would Melt if you Understood the needless Hell I've been through nearly countless times in most of those paths generated since I was an older boy .. 
..
.. because of women (well, us all) unable to face their true Ugliness, their willingness to lie to their children for selfish reasons, minor gains, or minor small-time profits, to twist into hell every day forward.
.
Staggering. 
To have some Understanding of the Consequences of a Lie, of a Sin.
Staggering. Leading to deaths and murders and Days nearly Uncountable
‚Äì God can count that large ‚Äì of Pain.
.
Praise God that I woke, 
finally, and found those Code embedded ‚Äútrues‚Äù that were false.
This pass through there are only two of these - I Remember, one was ‚Äúwomen can't hurt you‚Äù and the second is still not found .. but it was mixed in with a large number of ‚Äúdo not kill‚Äù .. which is actually True, but I ripped them out anyway .. I don't need them Hidden anymore. 
""Do not Kill"" is a Truth that has .. many Colors. 
.
What other Programmed Lie am I functioning under ‚Äì do you suppose? 
. 
It's not that most of us every day Should ‚Äì but by the Mercy of God ‚Äì be thrown into Hell for our Sins ‚Äì that is very True. 
.. Lying to your Children and those you don't Hate. You are mixing Hate and Love, Unbelievably Ugly.
(God has .. infinite Mercy, He keeps giving us another chance, while Punishing versions of us by making us Pay (mostly) reduced costs, to Burn feeling some of all the Pain we cause ...)
.
.
Anyway, I wanted to mention a Dream I had two nights ago. 
..
I was brought into what I thought was a Restaurant to work, with others ‚Äì maybe 10 or 12, I think we were slaves, and the 'locker-room' was in the basement and we were to change to Serve those coming in, but the leather pants I was to put on (it was human skin) had two big square patches cut from the right leg, so I tried to find another pair of pants, and the others seem to be moving out and around and I think they were taking my stuff, and I found that my shoes were gone, and I needed to find someone who worked there to help me, but all I found were the others ..
.
After a while a big man came in and approached and I shook his hand and said my name, and my hand was small in his, and he was not only big, but I felt like I was maybe 12 years old meeting a clearly competent world leader type, and he said his name was ‚ÄúAm‚Äù
.
And I thought ‚ÄúAm‚Äù? What a strange name and was about to ask Him what kind of name was that, and in the back of my mind I thought maybe I would sort of joke with Him about it, but before I could speak He said ‚ÄúDon't make a big thing about it.‚Äù Which I took to mean that maybe like His height that He didn't want me asking Him how the Weather was up there or such with His name ‚Äì so I didn't.
.
The ""do not make a big thing about it.‚Äù kept me ignorant of the Magnitude  - to act normally, not as you would if you realize you are standing before God.
(He does this .. makes you feel as it you are Equal, that who you are talking to is a regular man and that you somehow are Greater .. so free to Be how you really are .. until He turns that off and you start blubbering - realizing that you have convicted yourself with your own words - it's .. effective.)
.
But what I did do is Size Him up. 
When you're a certion type of person ‚Äì as I am ‚Äì being faced with someone with clear Advantages such as size or tools or experience or such, I consider how I might ‚Äúgo against‚Äù them. Not that there was or ever is any feeling of threat, or such, just an exercise in thoughts..
(I've mostly stopped doing that because day-to-day I don't run into people I'm not sure I couldn't Master if really needed. Not when God will help me.) 
.
Like usual I thought something like ‚ÄúWell, I wouldn't want to go against Him, but if I needed to then .. I would give it my best.‚Äù
.
God, .. I mean ‚ÄúAm‚Äù didn't seem to mind. 
Didn't help me find cloths or shoes either, but that seemed okay. (On reflection .. your Sacrificial Beast you are about to Serve doesn't need cloths.)
.
Later I ran into Him outside in a courtyard which was a weird maze of glass walls which I could sometimes move through, and when I saw Him, He was in the maze also with another normal height man on His left and I was able to move to stand with Him and talk, and we talked ‚Äì which I don't remember now what was said, but then the Dream changed completely and I was in .. my yard somewhere but it have a lot of tents and things filling the area, and I had my pet Cat and .. a Dogish animal, but like a Ferret, and other animals .. I think it was changing but very friendly like a dog .. perhaps it was a Dragon that could change shapes, but friendly and trustworthy.
.
The Cat was a pet Cat. 
.
And for some reason I was trying to have a Catholic Mass with then, but I couldn't
remember how to do the Mass (and felt I should have known) and these pets kept wondering away .. because I wasn't doing it correctly.
.
There some other bits about a friend from a few years ago showing up with a dump-truck with a co-worker and I gave him a dollar he needed for something and as soon as he had the money in his hand he sped away without giving me a sec to step off the running
board I was standing on to hand him the dollar, so I lurched off, and the truck cut the corner of the property and .. I haven't decided what that could mean yet.
.
Anyway. I found it strange enough to be pondering it for two days. There is more ‚Äì of course, and shades to it that would take a small book to convey.
.
Dreams within Dreams within .. Jesus's Holy Dream.

UgzE4DKd-VO--I2bCZN4AaABAg,Nick J,1516504447090,"About the last question:
""The presumptuous man is convinced that he has acquired a distrust of himself and confidence in God, but his mistake is never more apparent than when some fault is committed. For, if he yields to anger and despairs of advancing in the way of virtue, it is evident that he has placed his confidence in himself and not in God. The greater the anxiety and despondence, the greater is the certainty of his guilt.

""The man who has a deep distrust of himself and places great confidence in God is not at all surprised if he commits a fault. He does not abandon himself to confused despair; he correctly attributes what has happened to his own weakness and lack of confidence in God. Thus he learns to distrust himself more, and he places all his hopes in the assistance of the Almighty. He detests beyond all things the sin into which he has fallen; he condemns the passion or criminal habit that occasioned his fall; he conceives a deep sorrow for his offence against God. But his sorrow, accompanied by peace of mind, does not interrupt the method he has laid down, nor does it prevent the pursuit of his [spiritual] enemies to their final destruction.""
Dom Lorenzo Scupoli

Maybe sounds a bit harsh in certain ways, but I find these to be the happiest kinds of advice. Like Dr. Peterson said about the woman who said to the psychiatrist: 'I really hope there's something wrong with me. . . . because either the world in its essence is conspiring against me and I'm doomed. . . . or I'm doing something wrong and I can change it!'"
UgxIVYwrKnvqpgmemdN4AaABAg,Voin,1516504447094,"Merry Christmas, Dr. Peterson. You've been a blessing to us all. I'm eagerly looking forward to the wisdom you'll share with us in the new year. God bless."
UgySdAijFxw7xEFF4_p4AaABAg,Voin,1516504447102,"So this is some reading-twixt-the-lines speculation, but I think it's an educated guess (b/c the text drops some implicit clues) on the significance to the people of the time of Joseph being given a multi-colored coat.

W/ stories like these I generally try to look at it from the perspective of people within the story first, before any further analysis. So what do we know about the characters in the story? We know that they were nomadic herdsmen who lived in an arid environment in the ancient Near East where water was hard to come by. Now if you've ever been in such an environment (I did my Air Force basic training in Lackland, Texas), you know that water basically equals life. And what visibly brings the water? Rain. If you're an ancient herdsman in an arid environment, moving from place to place to keep yourself & your herds watered, rain might seem like the heavens themselves answering your prayers for water & blessing you with precious life-giving substance.

And what comes after the rain that is multicolored? A rainbow. So perhaps one symbolic interpretation of Josephs coat was something like a ""blessing of life & bringing of sustenance"" (which he, by the way, fulfilled for a multitude of people by staving off famine, so this is by no means a stretch).

But as anyone who's lived in these environments can attest (I later lived in San Antonio, Texas for about a year), too much rain can be disastrous (I recall during the flooding there, a truckload of National Guardsmen who were doing disaster relief - trained professionals - overturned & they drowned, so this is not a ""primitive ancient people problem""). Now where have we seen a rainbow before in Genesis that sealed a covenant promising to withhold destruction via flooding rain? God's covenant w/ Noah.

Again, if Jacob had grown up w/ the story of Noah, it's not a stretch (IMO) to suppose that he saw his favored son as not only the continuation of that covenant, but also as a balance between bringing the bringing life and destruction (which ties in nicely to Dr. JBP's conclusion about Joseph's character at the end).

Again, this is just my speculation, but think - why did Jacob commission something as specific as a mulitcolor coat to honor Joseph? Why not give him jewelry? We see in other places in the Bible (Parable of the Prodigal Son) that both were a way of lavishing honor upon someone in those cultures. In a pre-industrial society, everything was hand-made, and not only would the labor cost of the coat have been expensive, but the multiple dyes too. This seems to indicate that Jacob wanted to impart on Joseph a value of attention to detail - a trait that we see Joseph fulfill to a high degree of excellence in Potipher's house, in the prison, and as Pharaoh's vizier over all of Egypt (which was basically an ancient superpower back then), and this character trait saved untold multitudes of people from starvation."

Ugwu6bHfk1JHncXdgq54AaABAg,djnikx1,1516504450688,"HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY¬†JOSEPH Wore ''THE COAT OF MANY COLORS'' ?
Joseph was a mythical character who portrayed the ""Child of Promise"", which is dwelling within each of US.
The Coat of this child who is brought forth through meditation, represents the covering ,or life force.
The Colors represent various aspects of the New Age of Promise. Red-Love, Scarlet-Energy, Yellow-Kingship, Blue-Peace, Purple-Wisdom, etc.
So the many Colored Coat represents the Life Force that covers us when we give birth to this Child through Virgin Consciousness in our Meditation.
Joseph also representes Light, as does Jesus.¬†
The many colored Coat also represents the Light Spectrum.

GENESIS-EVOLUTION: ¬†CAIN AND ABEL
The allegory of human consciousness and the evolution of consciousness continues in Genesis in the story of Cain and Abel.
To understand the allegory we have to understand the meaning of the names.
Cain means ""tiller of the soil"". We are Cain when we dig up from our earth.
¬†I am sure that many times you have asked someone ""where did you dig that up"".
Our ideas which originate from the left side are Cain.
Abel means ''keeper of the sheep''.
Sheep are higher thoughts. In the Christmas story the shepherds are the first ones to see the Christ.
They were keeping watch over their sheep.
This means that those who watch over ¬†thought through meditation are the first to experience Christ consciousness.
So Cain is the left hemisphere of the brain, and Abel is the right.
Genesis 4 verses 3&4, Cain brings the fruit of the ground as an offering to the Lord.
In other words that which grew out of his mind. His own ideas.
Abel brought the firstlings of his flock. The flock is sheep, higher thoughts. The energy of the right side.
The importance of the allegory surrounds the word ""firstlings"".
Let us look at 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first was made a living soul, the last a quickening spirit.
ln 1 Corinthians 15:46, this is made a bit clearer. That was not first which is spiritual, but which is natural.
So Abel sacrifices the natural part. That is exactly what you and I do in meditation.

THE PERFECTION OF 12
Rev 21:2 to 21:21. ''I saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride. A wall great and high with 12 gates, the 12 angels of the 12 tribes. With 12 foundations of the 12 apostles, measuring 12 thousand furlongs. And upon the 12 gates were 12 pearls.''
The understanding is that the universe is a great organism like the human body. Every phase of the functions of the universal body has a correspondence in the human body.
The Greeks who wrote the New Testament, believed that the spiritual nature of man descended into material existence from the Milky Way, through one of the 12 gates of the great Zodiacal band.
The 12 signs of the Zodiac.
The 12 tribes of Israel.
The 12 gates of the heavenly city, New Jerusalem.
The 12 disciples, the 12 apostles.
And there are 12 signs of the zodiac, and 12 pairs of cranial nerves in the human brain finding their way through 12 apertures, or openings into the body.
As above so below."

UgzSq2PwgMNbvwuFK2t4AaABAg,Dolly Sundstrom,1513826056473,"Rest of my notes on this lecture: Dreams:

Dreams may be the way the left and the right hemisphere communicate with each other, the verbal and the nonverbal. The right nonverbal part sees pattern and is trying to conceptualize the world, things you haven‚Äôt mastered that make you anxious and nervous.  It looks for places where your model of reality is wrong. Sorting out those images and problems and difficult feelings is taxing and your brain sorts it out at night. Dreams are an update mechanism.  A repeated dream is a problem you don‚Äôt know how to solve.
Animals also must dream to stay sane.

Morality and being: alignment with the highest ideal

Your best chance, according to Dr. Peterson, is to ‚ÄúMove forthrightly out into the world, establish a faithful relationship with being, an attempt to conduct yourself with integrity.‚Äù

Morals have more to do with action.

Most people are keenly aware of the ways that they fall short even of their own ideal.   If only the good guys win we‚Äôre really in trouble; It‚Äôs not that easy to be a ‚Äògood guy‚Äô. 

You might ask yourself, if you weren't striving to actively make things worse, just how much better might things be?  People like houses that are divided against themselves and like going in 6 different directions at the same time and working at cross purposes to themselves and indulging in bitterness and resentment and unprocessed memories and childhood hatreds...it‚Äôs not only enough to establish a positive relationship with being, which is essential description of faith, you have to make a decision.  Being is very ambivalent, and you can make the case that it‚Äôs something that never should have happened, but that isn‚Äôt very productive.  

Faith is saying I‚Äôm going to act as if being is ultimately justifiable and if I partake in it I‚Äôll improve it rather than making it worse.

Some people who are ambivalent to begin with get hammered by what they go through in life into an ethical shape that, by midlife, plants them solidly into people who you can trust who don‚Äôt betray being or their fellow man.

First, iIt seems reasonable to establish a relationship with the transcendent, even if that‚Äôs just a future you, and second: you have to align yourself in a truthful manner. That‚Äôs your best bet, but it might be good enough.

Morality is truth in conception and action.

Tragedy and Suffering

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a serious enough person until your clothes have been dipped in blood.‚Äù

People are always looking for an excuse to corrupt their character.  Because then you get to lie and you get to cheat and you get to lie and betray and act resentfully and you get to do nothing, and that‚Äôs all easier than telling the truth.  A tragedy is the excuse you‚Äôre looking for to fall apart.

But maybe really the only misfortune is to become corrupted, and all other suffering is trivial by comparison.

Faith and wrestling with God:

We all wrestle with God; we are moral agents with conscience and free will.  That struggle is the nature of your moral relationship with reality. We wrestle with reality we understand, and reality we don‚Äôt understand.  
The common straw-man argument against faith is that it‚Äôs the willingness to demolish your intellect for a superstition. But the reality is much more sophisticated. Faith is, in the psychological sense, aiming at the highest good: conceptualize a balanced ideal, for example, what do you want for your family, what do you want for your career, character development, use of your time, and come up with an integrated ideal, and you put it above you as something to reach for, then you‚Äôre more committed to the world in a positive way and you‚Äôre less tormented by anxiety and uncertainty. If you can‚Äôt come up with a positive relationship with your being the world is hellish.  So it‚Äôs a rational strategy.

You can derive information from your own experience and see, in your own life, if you‚Äôre on a productive path that ennobles and enlightens you, or a destructive path.  The dichotomy between those paths might be real; that allows you to give credence to your own intuitions.

Since you‚Äôre alive, developing the highest regard for the fact that you‚Äôre alive can‚Äôt possibly be a losing strategy.  So that‚Äôs something like faith. Faith in ‚Äòbeing‚Äô as such.  If you could orient your being properly, then maybe that would orient yourself with the goodness of being.

Decision Making:

Having a life:: You have to move out into the world regardless of the circumstances at hand.  There‚Äôs no time  for sitting around; you need to go out and engage.  ‚ÄúHarkening to the voice of the Lord‚Äù.  That doesn‚Äôt mean the path will be easy.  

The improper way to engage with the world:
--A bitter jealous resentful attitude when life is not fair.  
--Destroy your own ideal.
--Intentionally try to make someone else‚Äôs life worse.  Resentment fuels polarization.

The proper way to engage with the world:

--Aim at the good.

Anxiety:

If someone is anxious about something and it‚Äôs getting in their way then you define it (because when you name it and speak about it you cut it down to size); then you discover that you‚Äôre braver than you know and you‚Äôre not as afraid as you think. As soon as you‚Äôre brave enough to talk about what you‚Äôre afraid of then you see that there‚Äôs more to you then you thought and there‚Äôs less to the problem than you thought and then you  can decompose the anxiety into smaller problems and then you can figure out how to approach those smaller problems.

During this process it‚Äôs not that you get less frightened, it‚Äôs that you get more courageous.
Technically how do people transform?

MOVE: Mastering automated motor movements--practice new skills very specifically, out loud and with body movement (motoric learning)
LISTEN: Generate new information and widen your understanding of the world and changes how you think--They learn how to focus intensely in anxious situations and listen very well while paying no attention to yourself.  They learn to ask others relevant questions while listening.
GENERATE NEW PROTEINS: (Be multidimensional). When you put yourself in new situations your body turns on new parts of your dna that make different proteins, so you have latent software that only works in new challenging situations. So you should go to lots of new situations and turn your inner self on.  Expand yourself by going (awake) into every situation you can. You acquire a differentiated mode of being by intentionally going into the widest possible number of places (physically, socially, culturally, interpersonally).

Learn to be more places and function properly to build your breadth of living and doing in the world.

The conditions of existence: The fundamental tragedies of life and malevolence and vulnerability come to every person; and you can‚Äôt hide from it because that actually makes it worse. 

Another option is to curse the state of the world for being malevolent and tragic. 

Another is to make yourself so damn differentiated and dynamic and able that you‚Äôre more than a match for that.

Families:

The most intense hatreds and intense loves are within families.  Sometimes people have been so damaged by the deceit and the betrayal and the trauma and the blurred lines, and are so enmeshed inside the pathological family that this is the only way they can conceptualize the world is in dysfunctional familial relationships.  They just can‚Äôt expand beyond the family to go out in the world.

When you, out of resentment, fight against the intuitions or dreams of another person you are in a sense fighting with being itself (or God),

Beware of foolishly undermining your traditions.  However, when God wants to intervene in humanity he inverts tradition; brings forth a new thing.

Put yourself right.
Put you family right.
Put the state right.

Character and Acting Rightly In The Face of Suffering, Tragedy, Chaos:

There‚Äôs an arbitrary element to existence that you can‚Äôt wish away, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt bad strategies and good strategies."

Motivational states: The call to adventure

Jung: ‚ÄòCircum-ambulation‚Äô  

So there‚Äôs a circling of yourself, getting closer to your potential self over time.

You have a potential future self, everything you could be, and that it manifests itself moment to moment in your present life by making you interested in things.  And the things that you‚Äôre interested in would guide you along the path that would lead you to maximal development.

Your interest is captured by the things that lead you down the path of development.  But often you‚Äôre interested in things that are warped and bent, and you get stuck in dead ends. It‚Äôs also an error-ridden process. But we‚Äôre capable of learning and of straightening ourselves out across time.

Overshooting the goal:
You will zig zag as you set a goal, your star, and then get close and realize you need to go in a different direction, and over and over again.  The mistakes are important learning.  But as you go forward in a zigzag way, tentative steps, assume that you‚Äôll do it badly.  But it‚Äôs much better to try and do it badly than to not step out and try.  As you get closer you‚Äôll get better at goals, and better at doing it right.

Enlightenment not a smooth upward climb: actually is punctuated by intermittent deserts:
(everything you learn means there‚Äôs something you have to unlearn: that‚Äôs painful and hard.)
 
Aim and set out toward the goal.
Escape from some tyranny in life.
Miss the mark (often quite badly).
Descend into the catastrophe of chaos (but better than a pathological state.) Suffering.
Wander around lost for a while. Find acceptance. 
Slowly pull yourself together and have some kind of a success.

LISTEN: Generate new information and widen your understanding of the world and changes how you think--They learn how to focus intensely in anxious situations and listen very well while paying no attention to yourself.  They learn to ask others relevant questions while listening.
GENERATE NEW PROTEINS: (Be multidimensional). When you put yourself in new situations your body turns on new parts of your dna that make different proteins, so you have latent software that only works in new challenging situations. So you should go to lots of new situations and turn your inner self on.  Expand yourself by going (awake) into every situation you can. You acquire a differentiated mode of being by intentionally going into the widest possible number of places (physically, socially, culturally, interpersonally).

Learn to be more places and function properly to build your breadth of living and doing in the world.

The conditions of existence: The fundamental tragedies of life and malevolence and vulnerability come to every person; and you can‚Äôt hide from it because that actually makes it worse. 

Another option is to curse the state of the world for being malevolent and tragic. 

Another is to make yourself so damn differentiated and dynamic and able that you‚Äôre more than a match for that.

Families:

The most intense hatreds and intense loves are within families.  Sometimes people have been so damaged by the deceit and the betrayal and the trauma and the blurred lines, and are so enmeshed inside the pathological family that this is the only way they can conceptualize the world is in dysfunctional familial relationships.  They just can‚Äôt expand beyond the family to go out in the world.

When you, out of resentment, fight against the intuitions or dreams of another person you are in a sense fighting with being itself (or God),

Beware of foolishly undermining your traditions.  However, when God wants to intervene in humanity he inverts tradition; brings forth a new thing.

Put yourself right.
Put you family right.
Put the state right.

Character and Acting Rightly In The Face of Suffering, Tragedy, Chaos:

There‚Äôs an arbitrary element to existence that you can‚Äôt wish away, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt bad strategies and good strategies.

If things aren‚Äôt going well for you in your life are you absolutely certain that you‚Äôre doing..."
Ugyv-bSeKDjD4kx2Gp94AaABAg,Dolly Sundstrom,1513826056489,"Some of my notes from this lecture:  If things aren‚Äôt going well for you in your life are you absolutely certain that you‚Äôre doing absolutely everything you can to put things in order?  Because if you‚Äôre not then you shouldn‚Äôt complain, because you don‚Äôt know to what degree you‚Äôre causing or contributing the circumstance.

Preparing for storms: Wake up. Conceptualize that even if things are going well now that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll continue to go well in the future. Make a model to test how things can go wrong. See if your systems can survive a storm.  If you refuse to look at the fact that you and your family may be in a pit at some point, and then it happens then it will be as bad as it can possibly be.

One of Peterson‚Äôs rules for life: Note that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.  Take responsibility where someone else is failing to do so.
Become indispensable at work.  It‚Äôs really really difficult to push down someone who‚Äôs really good at doing things.

To survive a famine store up bread, but also store up character: the source of bread. There isn‚Äôt a force more powerful than character on earth; this is the message of the story of Joseph.

See and speak and make the world out of the pieces of your adversary.

There is no evil so evil that good cannot triumph over it.

Goals:

Almost all the positive emotion that you‚Äôre going to feel in your life will happen in relationship to a goal. You get positive emotion as you move toward your goal.

Set the goal properly.  Maybe, ‚ÄúWhat would you be like if you turned on everything inside you that could be turned on?‚Äù

Align yourself with the star above the horizon, and then get the best of your culture behind you and move out into the world.

If you want to maximize positive emotion, which is what pulls you out into the world as well as feeling good, then you need the best possible goal.  The best goal is multi-faceted and will engage the most segments of your being (a narrow goal won‚Äôt keep you engaged) even your fear and your anger; you need a goal that justifies the tragedy and the malevolence of life.    

You have to pursue a high goal long enough to see who you would be attaining the goal."

Ugw2DpMtZdHqAKgCixB4AaABAg,Voin,1513826058907,"Another significant factor to consider is b/c of the vast difference of wealth & manufacture in ancient times compared to our own, ""clothing"" was not something mass-produced back then that the typical person owned a wardrobe of (and probably didn't recall all that they owned) or that you could pick up for cheap at the local Salvation Army if you were poor. In a pre-industrial world, everything was made by hand, which means the labor to make an article of clothing was not only time-intensive, but also expensive. This leads to a stark disconnect in the way that modern people view clothing to the way the Biblical ancients viewed it, & the dramatic significance it had for them. A poor laborer might only own the one set of clothing, while a rich person (like Jacob) could afford several & give them away as gifts forward to, instead of the inward groans w/ which we receive clothes in the modern day. Presenting someone with a well-made piece of clothing (usually outerwear) made from expensive material was a lavish show of wealth & a significant status symbol of climbing the dominance hierarchy.

Instead of a $20 t-shirt, think of it more along the lines of how we think of a car - the average person might own just 1 (if it's even payed off), & in a household there might be 2 or even 3, but they're gonna be used regularly. Generally only rich people have multiple ones to show off & not use. And you generally don't go lending it out thoughtlessly, b/c your livelihood & social life depend on being able to use it to get places.

This becomes particularly significant when people are said to ""rend (tear) their clothes in anguish/mourning), or when Christ says ""And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well."", because the (mostly poor) people He was talking to might only own one or two sets of clothing to begin with. (I really wish Dr. JBP would consult w/ Biblical historians, as I think that would give so much depth to these already-amazing lectures).

So Jacob giving his favored son Joseph a multicolored coat becomes less ""here, have this sweater for X-mas"", & ""here son, I bought you a Ferrari, hope your older brothers don't get envious."""

Ugz_P-ZVygy3Fw_G6zt4AaABAg,Nick J,1513826059014,"That's interesting how he tied the Coat of Many Colors with the Church, which ""when it is grown up . . . the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof,"" and ""Its leaves are most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much: and in it was food for all: under it dwelt cattle, and beasts, and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode: and all flesh did eat of it"" (Mt 13:32; Dn 4:9). For the Church, the New Israel, is the flock of Christ the Good Shepherd: ""O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep"" (Ps 79:2).

Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant, and the vision of the Woman of Revelation (which applies to Mary), are great figures of the Church [Mary is our perfect exemplar of a member of the Church, and God's masterpiece of creation], like Joseph, most of all because they are figures of heroic faith. Think about Joseph's coat and his second dream, and what was written by St. John:

""And the temple of God was opened in heaven: and the ark of his testament was seen in his temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake, and great hail. And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. . . .""

The Left doesn't seem to get this. It seems their resentment towards others is part of what fuels their not only willingness, but eagerness to give a pass to malevolent individuals, in order to use them as a weapon by proxy against all those people they themselves don't have the balls to strike out at directly. I.e. look at how the Left excuses everything from inner-city crime to the atrocities of Islamists, claiming it all to be ""a product of their environment"" & saying it's ""justified revenge"" against fabled ""oppressors"" (as long as it's not them directly), all the while dehumanizing the individuals committing these acts as mindless cattle reacting to exterior stimuli instead of regarding them as fully-human moral agents with free will to make their own decisions."
UgyIf1gSxRBj8DWuKBl4AaABAg,Yossi Staif,1513826059028,"There is that part where Joseph is his father's favorite because he is his son of old age - the meaning of this is that at your later part of life you tend to appreciate different things in life, and it is a time for you to gain wisdom.

The solution of the maze is the result of the proper behavior for the population to survive. The individual cell that is part of the slime has no concept of the solution of the maze yet those individuals who happen to behave in the right manner will be the ones who keep the population alive. The individuals who don't align to that pattern simply die. The solution of the maze is the pattern that results from the pattern of behavior which is embedded in the DNA, which in turn is another layer of patterns. The solution of the maze is transcendent to the biology of the individual yet it is physical in its nature but can only be perceived if the correct intellectual frame is applied.

You act toward your mostly implicit goal, the action transforms you, and as a consequence you sharpen the epistemic tools that will enable you to more clearly articulate your goal, and thus more accurately move toward your goal. 

The Hegelian jump is that this is the very process is the development of consciousness (as a phenomenon) throughout history and is retraced by each individual consciousness as it makes itself ever closer and closer to the goal of becoming an ultimately self-sovereign individual."

Dr. Peterson has helped put that pain into perspective, he has helped make that pain make sense. 
He cannot, and does not intend to make my tortured and tormented  childhood OK. What he does is give me a roadmap towards the future. His teachings give me an existence based on positivity, based on the creation of a positive tangible reality. Thank you. Tonight in particular, December 19, 2017, I spent the entire evening out in my garage, crying, as I remembered my immensely unhappy childhood life, all alone. I locked myself in my garage, away from the world, because even my pain causes me embarrassment.
Feeling empty, and embarrassed for my own emotions, I came inside to go to bed at 1:15 in the morning,

UgwnbmqZREpN8vNxHSN4AaABAg,MojoPin1983,1513826086060,"Jordan, why are you hesitant to discuss the historicity of the New Testament; namely: the gospels and letters of Paul?  Will you ever consider having any discussions with apologists such as William Lane Craig, John Lennox, Ravi Zacharias and N.T. Wright?  It‚Äôs frustrating how you avoid questions like this.  With all due respect, I don‚Äôt understand your ambivalence.  You could have some really fruitful, profound conversations with these men and open your audience up to these amazing philosophers of our day.  You and Ravi would have a lot to discuss re Nietzsche.  He constantly cites him in his lectures.  Even if you disagree, with respect to Christ‚Äôs divinity, it would be no less intriguing to witness a chat with any of these men.  I think they would rank among your post popular videos."

UgyC9ugZQjtbpRfS62J4AaABAg,GammaCatch,1513826090967,"JBP was on Glenn Beck yesterday. With that in mind: Glenn changed my life too. First he made me aware of Constitutional Libertarianism in the context of Judeo-Christian Culture and it‚Äôs history in relation to Western Culture. Then he made me aware that fighting back was OK, was NECESSARY, was OUR RESPONSIBILITY! Self reliance. Individualism. That it is the destruction of the individual under the guise of benevolence and the violation of the sanctity of the human heart that brings Men to failure. ‚Äî‚Äî-And then he walked that all back, rewrote the past. So that taught me something different. I‚Äôll never know the motivation. Some say money, black mail, mental breakdown, creeping dementia of some sort. I say it was a pathological need for a false purity based on false equivalencies taught by The Leftist he wanted to humanize as well as misinterpreted scripture and the histories of MLK and Gandhi. I learned that after someone walks back a history of their own philosophy, that you must go back and find what was true and what was not in all that they once said. I say this as a guy who did not vote for Trump, and I‚Äôd like to say would not, but GLENN has convinced me otherwise in the past few days. So, in the end Glenn Beck taught me that the greater good is not done always done with cleanliness in desperate times, and there will always be a touch of hypocrisy. That it is easy to be seduced by false equivalency in wanting to humanize our fellow Man. This was in the history lessons GB was once in curation of. Now all he assembles are ascending pulpits."

You take yourself too seriously. I know you have fun but it is so understated that it is frustrating. 

I would love to see a video about something you are superiorily passionate about! I want to see something that you care about so much I get to see your true emotions, your soul and what it is made of. 

You shelter yourself from us. Will you ever make a single video where your heart takes over and you are vigilantly on fire about one topic or another? 

Do not tell me you are passionate about these topics. If that is true and this is all of the passion you can consume from your soul, I despise the restraints you placed upon your own wrists."

I've been binge-watching JBP's videos for 18 months, and was inspired to try my hand at making similar content, but focussing on different topics (so as not to reinvent the wheel). I sometimes wish Dr Peterson would veer away from political topics more often, because in the world of psychology and philosophy, there are many other fascinating and rich areas to explore. That's why I was so excited to chat with Dr Collett with the topic: ""How might a Doctor of Psychology approach writing fiction?""

Topics we crossed include:
 - Hoarding & collecting,
 - Narrative Psychology,
 - Fictional Final Goal Theory,
 - Cognitive Dissonance Theory,
 - Carl Jung,
 - William James,
 - Sigmund Freud,
 - Alfred Adler,
 - and more.
Dr Collett is a pretty entertaining and funny bloke, so I really enjoyed hosting this conversation, and I hope you enjoy listening to it."

God is not dead.
I had to bury my grandmother who was basically my mother on the day of this lecture. I held her hand as she was dying from septic shock, alone with her in an awful hospital room. She couldn‚Äôt talk but was mouthing the word ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and I never left her side to make sure I was there to get the nurses to relieve her pain. It was a huge responsibility to keep it together for the final hours of someone who lived 92 years. All I wanted was to crawl into a ball and sob and plead with God to not take her from me. I did the opposite, I made sure she knew I was there for her and I pleaded with God to take her for her suffering was too much. She didn‚Äôt deserve this. Why would God make her suffer so much? She obeyed him for 92 years and she died clawing at me in desperation. I try to be as good as a person she was. I‚Äôm not but I will always keep trying. I was the ‚Äúuseful‚Äù person at the funeral and made sure everything was perfect and according to her plans. Two weeks later and I‚Äôve been feeling very lost without my 92 year old confidant who was my key to the past. I plead with my 3 year old to remember her since they just shared happy moments and hugs days prior while we visited her home before her sudden illness leading to sepsis. Also, thanks Dr. Peterson because I just wrote down everything I was thinking moments prior as I was trying to sleep. I usually listen to religious topics as I drift off to sleep but I couldn‚Äôt find anything that was interesting enough. Perhaps, because everything seems to irritate me these days.  I got a notification of this video and I felt a bit of happiness for the first time in 2 weeks and something to look forward too if I don‚Äôt finish tonight."
