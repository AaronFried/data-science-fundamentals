A mutual agreement on facing the sufferings of live together in the bound of marriage, truly an arguably best manifestation of extraordinary lectures. Loved it, beautiful, shed a tear over it tbh.
The only thing I regret out of this is that I'm 1 year late on discovering this treasure called biblical series that helps me reconfigure my life and change my perspective over matters and actually put motives and meaning over being with the consequence of pushing my life forwards which if I learnt about it right away, I couldn't imagine how far my true potential could be manifested right now. 

I have started watching from january 2018, and only until now reached the 12th episode of this series, slowly but surely enacting the thoughts I sorted out on each episode I watched and learnt. I'm happy to report that, after acting out the articulated thoughts and motives I gained from watching these lectures, I went from 29.2 BMI to 25, and gained 6 kg of muscles just by facing my unknown territory called ""the gym"". I've also gained the raise I've always dreamed of by putting motivations and meanings in front of my actions towards my jobs and set my ""fear of the Lord"" behind my motives. I am now considering on facing the next great adventure of mine by sacrificing the financial safety I currently have over my job and push towards the great unknown called entrepreneurship with the obviously insufficient but good enough knowledge I currently have on my hand and I'm ready to meet the famine I will encounter first through this new adventure just like how I tackled with the fact that it was my own performance that hindered that rise on the first place and how I tackled with my 1st 2 months of fruitlessly working out to figure out that the real problem is on my unregulated unhealthy diet. As fearsome it is as how the famine will reveal itself to me this time, I will push forwards because I'm perfectly aware that my job right now though I done it wholeheartedly, is not the full potential ideal of me that I see I could be in the future and that if what I acted out was a truth, then the true potential of being will manifest itself before me.

Thank you very very much Dr. Peterson who revealed this to me throughout the series of these biblical lectures. Though sadly, this comment may never reach you in person, I still wholeheartedly grateful of your significant existence, Dr. Peterson."

Ugz3UIPmvCLsvlf0S5d4AaABAg,Malvictis,1532142767210,"During the first 35 (I'm 35) years of my life I did not get my values from the Christian faith - I'm honestly not sure I had any values at all (can you have ""values"" if you value nothing?) The first 35 years of my life have not worked out well for me, so I had the thought, ""What if there's something I'm missing?"" I began to look, with the help of Dr. Peterson's lectures on the subject, at the religion not as a description of an almighty being, but as the lessons learned and passed down by the founders of our civilization. I realized that I agreed with Dr. Peterson's supposition that it seems quite significant, the fact that those stories have been passed down and preserved for so much time. It seems they might have something to offer. 

When I started listening to the Maps of Meaning lectures, I was in a state of depression so deep I may not have survived the year had it continued. No job, no friends; no relationships with anyone outside of my very small family - I made mistakes that made it impossible to stay at my last job, though I had drained that job of any meaning long before the mistakes. I blamed everyone and everything except myself. I was Cain. 

Over the first couple of days (and I binged the lectures) I felt as though there was a tiny point in the center of my being that was reaching out to the parts of me that had been shattered by my inner tragedy and clicking them back into place. Lessons that my father had tried to instill in me while he still lived began to sink in for the first time. I began to feel whole again (I say, ""again,"" but I've never felt this determined in my life) as I came to some understanding of the message the stories were attempting to relay. I don't know what to make of any of this - had you asked me a few months ago whether or not I believed in God, I would have said ""No."" Now, if I were asked that question, I would respond, ""That depends on what you mean by God."" At the same time, I also understand that I don't know what the hell I really do believe because action is the only valid indicator of belief. So do I yet believe in anything?

 I've been wrestling with this problem, these concepts, without stopping for quite some time now.

I'm hearing that small voice in my head as I write this and I'm trying to listen. I feel almost as though I can't speak about anything I used to say I believed. I have to start over with the formulation of beliefs that extend outward from this core that has established itself seemingly of its own accord in the center of my being. This has been a remarkable (and remarkably strange) experience for me.

I'm taking too long to get to the point. A question has been nagging at me since a major piece of the puzzle clicked into place: Why did I not learn these things sooner?

I'm trying to examine this question without externalizing the blame. I understand that these things were always there, right in front of me. I even went to church when I was very young. I know that a very large portion of the blame is my own (if blame is the right word.) 

I don't think that's all of it, though. I have always been infinitely skeptical of what I deemed to be ""magical thinking."" I had a very primitive understanding of the evolutionary process even at a young age (when my mother would take me to the library, more often than not I picked up a book on dinosaurs or other biology books, which inevitably led me to questions of evolution), and my interest in the subject has led me to gain what I would call (at least for my geographical location) a better than average understanding of the evolutionary process. Though incomplete, I see the theory as a scientific truth. Any religious structure I would be capable of accepting would have to be reconciled with that. No religious person had ever attempted (to my incredibly lacking knowledge) to do that in any way that couldn't immediately be identified as nonsense. As a child, I remember posing the question (when the Sunday School teacher was on the subject of Creation in a literal sense), ""But what about the dinosaurs? They died 65 million years ago."" The teacher had no acceptable answer (I think the answer he gave was that days were longer in those times.) I was 6 when I stopped going to church. I think many Christians act out their belief in the lessons of their faith without actually being able to articulate why, exactly, or even being able to articulate the lessons themselves, for that matter.

I've been hammering at Peterson's interpretations and I find myself incapable of finding any valid argument against them. 

In Nietzsche's statement that ""God is dead,"" the revelation was that the human psyche had changed to a point at which future generations would have a hard time accepting the idea of a God in the literal sense of the word (correct me if I'm wrong.) I think this is correct. In fact, I think I'm living proof of that. This would be a reason for my outright rejection of the entire premise (fool that I am, I threw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak.) 

As biological creatures are subject to the processes of evolution and the conceptual structures of sentient beings are an environmental variable in that evolution (which seems glaringly obvious now that it's been brought to my attention), then it stands to reason that the conceptual structures, themselves, are subject to evolutionary pressures as well. The evidence of the truth of this is prevalent throughout human history. It's to be found in the countless dead religions and with them, the civilizations that upheld them (without adapting them to the times) as their highest value. Humans seem to have a symbiotic relationship with their conceptual structures - as the central concept dies, so does the civilization. The hypothesis is that the religions (cultures) that survive are the ones that are able to adapt - that may be the key to the question of why Christianity (this is the religion with which I have experience - as an example, it is not a preference for any other reason) has survived for so long when others have failed. Christianity (probably primarily because of its countless schisms) has been remarkably adaptable.

I understand this is incredibly long for a youtube comment. In fact, I'm not even sure if comments can be this long. I guess I'll find out.

The point (and the question) is: Since the human psyche has shifted so far toward the materialist side of the spectrum and the literalist message that is so common among Christians (maybe this is only my limited experience) is not able to penetrate the inherent skepticism that is associated with that, might it be time to consider some form of secular Christianity that may be able to accomplish the task? Might it not be time for the Church to adapt in order to give the message (and probably the culture) a chance to survive? 

I suppose that's the reason Dr. Peterson is doing what he does and I, for one, am immensely grateful for that. It really may have saved my life - I intend to prove myself worthy of the second chance."

Ugz4t6k97p-r-Yl5ERh4AaABAg,paulchri69,1529550768642,"I would be interested to hear what he has to say on the central theme of the NT. Salvation through faith, and not of works, has to be a tough concept to rationalize. Essentially, it is believing in something without doing anything. Salvation is a concept that is only achieved from the confines of the mind. What salvation could we possible have by believing that someone else sacrificed so that we could be free? If it was not a real person's sacrifice that wipes away the transgressions of humanity, then it would have to be that humanity is saved by believing in sacrifice of one for the sake of others. This is not a natural ""survival of the species""' concept for humankind. It is not explained through reflection on a biological evolution of a species, but is rather contrary to it. I suppose you could make the argument that it works on a familial level, where love is the natural controlling factor, but for a society to function on the basis of this concept would essentially require an unnatural, or supernatural, influence that goes against the nature of mankind. 
The very ""new"" nature of Adam and Eve and all their descendants would disallow the existence  of a sacrificial society of which was predicated on love for one another. To say that this was possible would be to propose yet another failed conceptual utopia. At the same time, the people who promoted this utopia in the bible had no such delusions of it's success in the physical realm of humanity and this earth, yet proposed a new heaven and a new earth in which it would succeed, which is prophetic, and ironically is what all proposed utopias are, which is a prophesy of a future that they envision if humanity would simply bend to their will, making them god. All works based religions are just this. They make the individual a god who can achieve the prescribed utopia though works and rituals. 
This is where Christianity differs from all other religions of the world. it is predicated solely on faith in someone else's sacrifice, which frees them to emulate their savior, which is to take a message of salvation to the world and let other individual people make a conscious choice to accept a gift which is achieved through intellectual consideration and belief in a ""gospel"". Beyond a simple choice, there is no requirement for salvation. Everyone who believes makes the choice to believe, and it is never under the threat of violence. Anyone who has ever used physical force to spread their belief has never achieved salvation for themselves, because love is the basis on which the true Christian spreads a message of salvation, and it is never done with purity of intent when even compensation is involved. It is purely an intellectual exchange of an idea, and another person's personal choice of acceptance that achieves all that they can hope to achieve in this life.
God has never died. There have been hierarchies in which the concept of god have been rejected, and societies have proceeded forth based on the assertions of those hierarchies. All that we have seen is the destruction of societies that have rejected the concept and morality of a god. The success of a society is predicated on the very god in which they cling. The Muslim god is not the god of the bible but is rather destructive to any society that it comes in contact with. The same can be said for virtually all other gods, just at different levels. Modern Judaism is a very racist, exclusive religion. I don't use the word ""racist"" lightly.  Most people just don't know what they believe because they attach it to Christianity for the sake of the onlooker. The only race mentioned in the bible is the race that people run. The only exclusions that Christianity makes is by the choice of the individual, and the only consequences for a choice in the negative is that Christians will just leave you alone or annoy you with their gospel multiple times which is hardly an existential threat. 
Given the self evident nature of mankind, it is not reasonable to believe in a utopia of intellectual salvation of the masses through the preponderance and study of mankind. What history has taught us is that societies who explore this utopia eventually break down morally and are weakened to the point of destruction, and for them, this was the existential threat lurking in the shadows of ignorance. 
The best that any culture or society can do is to adopt a predominant religion which is based on the existence of a higher authority than themselves and submit to it, which is ultimately going to be viewed as an ideologically driven society. The problem with that is that the people have to believe in the higher power in order to obey the tenants for mankind set forth by the higher power. Good luck with that, because the whole society would have to be based on faith in something that they cannot see nor touch. The bible refers to a thing called ""science falsely so called"". The real mistake of mankind was bring in the origin of species doctrine, which removed the higher power, and replaced god with a theory that cannot be seen nor touched. And so we stand on shifting sands, of which the quagmire of the 20 century was predicated."

I was once a fundamentalist Christian and embraced the former view.  I am no longer deluded by religion and I am appalled that I once admired Abraham's actions.  I appeal to any fathers that read this that the following is the only response a father should give to such an obscene utterance.
""You are almighty God and if you want my child's blood I cannot stop you but it will not be spilled by my hand...and if you must have blood then take mine and spare my son.""

So what happened to cause the law/ grace fracture line, the blood-feud that broke Israel into two kingdoms after the death of Solomon.

UgxpQBCwNKFA7Hrp29N4AaABAg,div inity,1524280370452,"Thank you for this Biblical series. I just read part XII and enjoy the way you've discerned God's word. I find the amount of respect you have for your words lines up nicely when handling such profound Truth. 

You seem to ask two questions: what must be sacrificed, and to what end? 

I've come to understand that we (those striving for Good) must sacrifice that which is most valuable: our free will.
And to that there is no end. An everlasting sacrifice. 
In all ways, while living life, we encounter a plan that is larger than we can imagine. 
Life is not meant to be hard. The fact that it is, in my estimation, is because we have exercised our free will to the point of exertion. Our knowledge has not progressed to wisdom, but regressed to mere information. Thankfully when we sacrifice our will for His, we gain the whole world.
But His burden is light... His yoke is easy. 
When God stepped into His creation and died as Christ He showed us what we were to give up. Christ did not WANT to go to the cross. Before he did he prayed to God and asked Him if there was any way He could be spared. Christ prayed God's will, not His own, and then walked it out. 
It's so damn heartbreaking. 
God did not withhold from us His greatest gift. The fact that God knew (from His first breath) that His son would suffer for sins, He still gave us evil to choose from. Our Father is amazing. 
He bore all sin to break our chains. We are no longer slaves to the world; we are no longer slaves to our flesh.
Yet, if you have eyes to see, you can look around it is clear to see the children of God willfully kneeling at the foot of their Father. Not because we have to. Not because we are commanded to. 
We offer our free will at the alter of Good, in exchange for eternal rest. 
We stand in His refining fire and allow Him to burn off our human nature. And we REST in His perfect plan, a work finished from the very beginning. 
Life is hard when you strive against His will, when Truth is not your foundation. 
I wholeheartedly believe that life is Good and our purpose it to give the good within us (our spark of divinity) back to the whole... To shine our God given light. 
In the bible Love is charity. Love is giving without the expectation of getting back. For God so loved the world He gave His only begotten Son! He gave Christ KNOWING we could never repay the gift. Charity. Altruism. 
Whatever gift God gave us, we can rest in the knowing that we are suppose to find it (sometimes in the depths of darkness), understand and know it intimately, and then give it away without ever looking back. Much easier said than done, ultimately. 
Again, thank you for your discernment! I look forward to hearing more. All love."

I ""schooled"" in the USA and Canada, more in Canada, well, during high school, college and university anyway.  (Elementary and junior high school were in the USA)  An archetype isn't an arc- or ark-type.  Arche isn't pronounced like either arc or ark; although, architecture is pronounce as if writable as arc- or ark-itecture, but 'i' and 'e' apparently produce different effects on preceding characters, as we can see right now with the latter word, for the 'ch' is followed by an 'a', not an 'e'.  Fun, eh.  Quite some language ""fun"".  Anyway, the 'ch' in archetype is pronounced in the soft way rather than hard .  Why do I bother to raise this point?  Good question, but it's because when listeners can become a little confused about what we say, proper pronunciation can ease their efforts for doing searches; f.e., at Wikipedia, or with a Web search engine, maybe even when using a print copy of a dictionary.  It's only for this reason that I raise this ""point"", because I employ pronunciation to try to guess the spelling of words I'm not familiar with yet and may want to seek their definitions.

UgzPlj1MCKd0x8g7gd14AaABAg,Caleb Kohl,1524280373411,"2:16:20 I agree with Peterson that it would be nice if we could all be Individuals. But what do we do when the Individuals are out massed by the Tribal? And the tribal ethnicities are happy to  leverage their cooperation in the theft of the wealth and freedoms of scattered Individuals? At this very moment the Western world is being flooded with people who have little to no interest in Individualism. They are happy to settle in enclaves and fight for the interests of their group -as a group. The West has not faced this situation before. Individualism has worked in the past  because it existed and was protected within homogeneous white (tribal) nations. But now Multi-Culturalism is the rage and across the Western world we are seeing a vocal tribal minority dominate the scattered White individuals (Eg. Blasphemy laws and Sharia in the UK and Canada). Therefore I ask, shall the White Identity not be resurrected in order to save all that it has built? Can we convince the millions of non-western migrants to be convinced of Individualism before our civilization is in ruins? Don't get me wrong. I agree that Tribal Identity is dangerous, but so is being killed by a Tribe (Eg. South Africa). I for one will not stand and watch as Western Civilization is invaded by those who trample on its women and spit upon its freedoms. I believe that the White Race must reawaken and learn from Communism that you can not make man into anything you want. You must take him as he is -and he is tribal."
UgwHRCV0bMzXkakqUwN4AaABAg,Bruce Gilbert,1524280373415,"Undoubtedly, there is a ""mentoring"" process that is occurring between God and humankind.   According to Acts, we are identified as God's offspring and there is a great deal of ""Social Engineering"" involved in our mortal placement:

Acts 17:
22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
25 Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

This ""truth"" is further supported in the genealogical lineage of Jesus as given in Luke 3:

23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, . . .
38 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

The sacrifice; therefore, of Isaac is an ""archetype"" of the sacrifice of God's Only Begotten Son in the flesh, Jesus.  Unlike Isaac; however, who was explicitly ""fallen"" and ""mortal,"" Jesus inherited immortality from His Heavenly Father and mortality from His Earthly Mother, Mary - having the ability to overcome death.  God is teaching Abraham about the supreme price of redemption.  Too, it is a test of faith for Abraham and Isaac to show their devotion and determination to serve and follow God, no matter the personal cost.

Hebrews 11:
17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

It was in the ""paradox"" of conflicting ""good"" that provided the ultimate test of devotion and faith.  The inherent truth of not killing was in direct opposition of offering Abraham's son at the request of God.  It was deliberated with the result of greater faith in complying with the directive ""accounting that God was able to raise him, (Isaac,) up, even from the dead . . . .""

Life is the deliberation and resolution of ""paradox.""  Herein is genuine faith demonstrated.  Paradoxes have resolution.

http://tinypic.com/r/w6uvd0/9

On being parents, we receive offspring by ""stewardship"" and not ""ownership.""  The principle being continuously reinforced is that God is mentoring and measuring us to see if we merit fellowship.

    And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
For He grew up before Him like a young plant,
    and like a root out of dry ground;
He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him,
    and no beauty that we should desire Him.
He was despised and rejected] by men,
    a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
and as one from whom men hide their faces
    He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.

Surely He has borne our griefs
    and carried our sorrows;
yet we esteemed Him stricken,
    smitten by God, and afflicted.
But He was pierced for our transgressions;
    He was crushed for our iniquities;
upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
    and with His wounds we are healed.
All we like sheep have gone astray;
    we have turned—every one—to his own way;
and the LORD has laid on Him
    the iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed, and He was afflicted,
    yet He opened not His mouth;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
    and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
    so He opened not His mouth.
By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
    and as for His generation, who considered
that He was cut off out of the land of the living,
    stricken for the transgression of My people?
And they made His grave with the wicked
    and with a rich man in His death,
although He had done no violence,
    and there was no deceit in His mouth.

Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush Him;
    He has put Him to grief;
when His soul makes an offering for guilt,
    He shall see His offspring; He shall prolong His days;
the will of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.
Out of the anguish of His soul He shall see and be satisfied;
by His knowledge shall the Righteous One, My servant,
    make many to be accounted righteous,
    and He shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the many,
    and He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
because He poured out His soul to death
    and was numbered with the transgressors;
yet He bore the sin of many,
    and makes intercession for the transgressors.""

In the end if the brain fully explains us, then we are not free to to choose to take his advice. This is the fatal flaw in a purely materialistic view of reality.

Cain's sacrifice no matter how good it was, as long as it's not as good as Abel's then it's not good enough? i think that Peterson really skipped some details from these kind of stories just to fit his narrative, it looks to me that there's more proof for God being an unjust system that forces its participants, just like a family or any kind of system, to partake certain roles then punish/reward them for no reasons of their own, i mean... think about it, it's the age old story about the father and the two sons that have the brother conflict just because for whatever reasons their parents prefer one of them, the other is destined to be the outcast, by Peterson's definition, the outcast should just go fuck himself because he didn't sacrifice enough, whatever the fuck that means, how about instead of that, the father and the brother of the coutcast go fuck themselves?

Only blood can wash away sin, God requires blood to cleanse our sin. Able was a sheep herder while Cain was a farmer. Able offered the best of his flock to God and spilled the blood on the alter while Cain brought the best of the field to the alter and was not what God requires to for his sin to be forgiven and be blessed.
  Abraham sought the heart of God and walked in his favor. God gave him that what he most wanted and prayed for, a son.  God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son, to spill his blood on the alter in sacrifice to him was both the ultimate test of Abraham's faith in God,  but also a  metaphor to follow for what God would sacrifice himself."" For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth  in him should have everlasting life"". (John 3:16)  God gave his only son on the cross in sacrifice so his blood was shed to wash away our sins. Only for the asking, no sacrifice required but to give up our sinful lives.

What sort of profound psychological trauma must that create within that person? Perhaps only through such abject betray, fear, anguish,pain, etc. does one feel the terrifying internal pressure of freedom. Felt at once within Isaac, Would be the instantaneous eruption of Hegel’s dasein in the presence Otto’s mysterium tremendum with a Sartrean authenticity. 

Born out of this terror is of the immediacy and present-ness of an individual who must now view themselves as something other than their set of roles or responsibilities. Isaac was betrayed by his father and his God. The person he most admired, looked up to, sought for council and comfort now becomes the agent of death at his creators behest. 

Isaac is then made to concieve of a wholly new concept – that of the individual self as existing outside of the notion of the family, society or even of religious devotion. This point, I believe, is driven home even more so because Isaac does not change his name. Whereas Abram becomes Abraham, Paul becomes Saul, Peter becomes Simon, etc… Isaac emerges as an abstracted symbol of the individual’s unique spirit whose essence, though activated by the will of God, is not made of the same God-stuff. He becomes fashioned out of a new and different clay that God can not mold in the same way. 

The crucifiction of Jesus, therefore, can be viewed as a retelling of the Abraham and Isaac story without an intervening agent. Perhaps Jesus’s crucifixion was God’s way of punishing himself for his testing of Abraham. Can God regret? Certainly not. God can, however, empathize. Jesus then, is not medium of salvation, but of God’s own revelation and commitment to the development of the spirit of the individual as something other than himself."

Ugxy6dmmykpGiVwuhCh4AaABAg,alittlestrength,1516504380721,"In this story, Isaac knows about the sacrifice of the Lamb; the blood sacrifice like Abel's that was acceptable to God. Abraham assures him that God will provide the Lamb. In the New Testament, John identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God. As so He is. Worthy is the Lamb.  God ordained and decreed that He would come to earth in the form of a man through the lineage of King David. He would be called Immanuel, meaning God with us and He would be called Jesus of Nazarath; arising from the land of the Gentiles. He was the Logos. the Eternal Word of God. He was God Incarnate. His work was to overcome the temptation to fulfill the desires of His flesh; to live as any man but without sin; being an obedient Son to the will of His Father, not abolishing the Law but fulfilling it once and for all time. There was no other way to make it possible for Adam's seed to live again. God had to experience Adam's death, his sin nature, to die in the flesh and overcome death by resurrecting Himself, becoming the Second Adam, free from sin and death. Sin and death had to be defeated by sinless eternal Life, Jesus Christ, the Light of the world who destroys the works of darkness. It is by and through the death, burial and resurrection of the God-Man, that God paid the price that was demanded for the reconciliation of man to his Maker. Salvation from the wrath of God is a gift that no man can earn through his own efforts.  The  corpse of a man has no power in it to put life back into himself. Flesh and blood cannot enter the Kingdom of God. Man must be born again of God;s Life Giving Spirit through faith in the redeeming work of His Son's death. There is no other name given under heaven by which man must be saved. Shalom in Jesus."
Ugy-5zWy-5JtGBf35IB4AaABAg,alittlestrength,1516504380727,"Peterson is mistaken. Abraham didn't keep his covenant with God. Under God's  testing, Abraham's faith eventually failed when he consented to try to get the promised child through Hagar, the Arabian handmaiden of Sarah. Nonetheless, God was faithful to bring Isaac into the world, fulfilling the promise He made to Abraham. Peterson is correct in saying that what you say you believe is not as important as how you act out your belief.  The point of this story is that mankind is unfaithful and God is faithful."

UgwBv2jB5wPUyzooxCJ4AaABAg,Aviram Gottfried,1513825983654,"BTW, some insights from Kabbalah, which is the origins of Judaism, about things that are hard to resolve:

1) The count of the world starts from Adam, who was the first to discover the one force that governs all of reality. Before that took place the process of evolution, all of which begins with one spark of light from the upper world entering this world, creating the whole of the universe, which is to show the difference between this world and the worlds above it, all of which are attainable (as Adam attained).
2) None of the words are to be taken literally. The whole biblical story is that of a process which each and every individual has to undergo within himself to discover the meaning of life, or in effect, to become similar to god (which was gods purpose in creation). In this respect your analysis of it is true in form.
3) It's the right hand, not the left, that implies grace/mercy (hassadim in hebrew), and the left which implies judgements (dinim).
The idea is that one is always guided towards the purpose of his being, whether through comfortable or uncomfortable means.
4) Relating to 3, the reason why the Jews in the testament, as you said, always ascribe everything bad that befalls them to their own inequities and never to god, is that god always gives one the best possible good that there can be, but it is up to the person to match up to that good, or he perceives it as bad.. A simple example is a kid who wants to play with the electric socket and his mom doesn't allow it. To him, at the moment, she is the embodiment of the devil, but if he were on her level, he would see her as good and benevolent. And attaining the 'degree' of god is exactly what each and every person must do in their lifetime (and not after. There is nothing after).

Hope that helps."

UgwhT5nYoJY98r8OO5V4AaABAg,Gerald McFarlin,1513825983702,"The ram god in this story is found throughout the bible.  In the Book of Revelation, he is called “the Amen.”  He is also our Saint Peter who is the foundation stone of Christianity.  In earlier mythos, he was a bull.
Amon may have been originally one of the eight deities of the Hermopolite creation myth; his cult reached Thebes, where he became the patron of the pharaohs by the reign of Mentuhotep I (2008–1957 bce). At that date he was already identified with the sun god Re of Heliopolis and, as Amon-Re, was received as a national god. Represented in human form, sometimes with a ram’s head, or as a ram, Amon-Re was worshipped as part of the Theban triad, which included a goddess, Mut, and a youthful god, Khons. His temple at Karnak was among the largest and wealthiest in the land from the New Kingdom (1539–c. 1075 bce) onward. Local forms of Amon were also worshipped at the Temple of Luxor on the east bank of Thebes and at Madīnat Habu (Medinet Habu) on the west bank.
Amon’s name meant the Hidden One, and his image was painted blue to denote invisibility. This attribute of invisibility led to a popular belief during the New Kingdom in the knowledge and impartiality of Amon, making him a god for those who felt oppressed.
Amon’s influence was, in addition, closely linked to the political well-being of Egypt. During the Hyksos domination (c. 1630–c. 1523 bce), the princes of Thebes sustained his worship. Following the Theban victory over the Hyksos and the creation of an empire, Amon’s stature and the wealth of his temples grew. In the late 18th dynasty Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) directed his religious reform against the traditional cult of Amon, but he was unable to convert people from their belief in Amon and the other gods, and, under Tutankhamen, Ay, and Horemheb (1332–1292 bce), Amon was gradually restored as the god of the empire and patron of the pharaoh.
In the New Kingdom, religious speculation among Amon’s priests led to the concept of Amon as part of a triad (with Ptah and Re) or as a single god of whom all the other gods, even Ptah and Re, were manifestations. Under the sacerdotal state ruled by the priests of Amon at Thebes (c. 1075–c. 950 bce), Amon evolved into a universal god who intervened through oracles in many affairs of state.

Ugzjp2S-61Hm8a3D23Z4AaABAg,Gerald McFarlin,1513825983708,"We now approach the most remarkable act of Abraham's whole life — the attempted assassination of his only son, Isaac; and this simply by the command of God! The analogy between this and the crucifixion of our Savior is readily seen: but of this in its proper place. Having prepared all things necessary and marched within three days' (three months') journey of the place pointed out by God (Aries setting), he left his two servants (the spring equinox and summer solstice) with his ass,* while he (the Sun) and Isaac (summer) went forward.
     * The ass, a star so named, is in Cancer, where the summer solstice occurs. This ass, of course, the Sun always, as he passes Cancer, leaves behind. Our Savior (the Sun) rode into Jerusalem (summer solstice) on this very ass, and one other in the same constellation, called by the sacred writer ""the foal of an ass."" Balaam failed to get his ass beyond, and brought an everlasting stigma on his name because of his brutal treatment of his ass — ""the ass rebuked him"" (Num. xxiii, 28
Poor Isaac wondered where was the sacrifice, but his father assured him all was right — that God (Aries setting) would provide it; and so he did; for he, God, the Ram, was the sacrifice and Isaac as well. ""And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son"" (Gen. xxii, 10). Wonder what the poor boy thought of his pious daddy, when he saw the glittering blade poised above him! But the Lord called, and Abraham looked, and ""behold a Ram caught in a thicket by his horns"" (Aries was then setting head-first), which he seized and offered instead of his son. Thus, as the Sun went down below the fall equinox, were the Lord (summer), Abraham (the Sun), God (Aries), and Isaac and all the rest of 'em sacrificed and pitched into Hell (winter) together! * 
Soon after this wonderful tragedy, Sarah died in that famous city Kirjath-arba=four cities = the four cardinal points in the Sun's ecliptic — ""the same is Hebron'' (Gen. xxiii, 2). Dr. Wm. Smith {Old Test. Hist, p. 88) believes ""Abraham must have returned from Beer-sheba to his old home"" at Sarah's death. The Doctor is right, for Abraham couldn't see his wife die unless he was at home — at Hebron, the Sun's crossing at the spring equinox ; for Sarah died when she went below the horizon, or set in the west.* 
       Angelo de Gubernatis, in his recent work on Zoological Mythology, vol. i, p. 377, says of this mythical ass: lt is certain that it existed in the heavens; it is certain that it flies in the air like a valiant warrior; that it terrifies its enemies in the sky with its terrible voice; that, in a word, it was a real and legitimate heroic animal. It is certain, moreover, that considered under another aspect, it not only throws down the heroes, but carries them down to Hell, serves the infernal monsters, and is found in connection with the treasures of Hell."" What a round-about-way this author takes to avoid telling his readers have said so at once had he not stood in awe of the priests. Cancer sets when the Sun rises in Capricorn. It is then found amongst the monsters of Hell. In summer Cancer is closely related to the Lord of Heaven — the Sun. 
       * The word sacrifice comes from the Lat. sacer=secret=hidden=lost; and facere=to make; i.e., sacrifice means to make sacred=hidden = secret=: lost (Andrews' 1 Lat. Lex.) Thus, if a person throw anything into the sea, lose it or in any way dispose of it so that it cannot be recovered, it is sacrificed, covered up, hidden and lost. This seems to have been the original idea; and the idea set forth in Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac; in God's sacrifice of his only son; nay, even in the sacrifice of God himself when ""he cut off his own head "" (see Bunsen's Egypt, vol. iv, p. 287, etc. etc.) 
     These fictions, as I have shown so far, all appear simple enough when understood; but priests, seeing their advantage, and making use of it, converted these mythological tales into the actual slaying of men and animals, the former to insure their dominion over their ignorant fellow-men, and the latter to secure a fat living for themselves at the expense of their dupes. 
Abraham, who, like the Son of Man (Sun of Earth), "" had not where to lav his head,"" now bought'.* the cave of Machpelah (the winding or spiral way, or Sun's course in the ecliptic), wherein he buried his wife. His purchase was from Ephron, the Hittite. — Ephron, literally fawn-sun, so called, it may be, in allusion to the warm summer nights, when the cervidae produce their fawns. Hittite, an epithet of Ephron, denoting terror or dread, i.e., the night, because he was the genius of the night, and by extension of the idea, of the winter also — both subjects of dread and terror to many. Thus, Sarah may be seen in her sepulchral vault on any fine night in April, May or June. Here it was, then, in the land of Ham, in the land of Canaan, in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre = summer, that Abraham buried Sarah, This field (the two hemispheres properly joined or coaptated) and the cave (night hemisphere of summer) that is therein were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burial-place by the sons of Heth (dread). (Gen. xxiii, 20.) 
After Sarah's death and burial Abraham began to think of his latter end. He, therefore, proceeded to marry off his son Isaac. By the Lord's guidance, Isaac was soon fitted with a wife. Rebekah (one snared) was his wife's name. Snared she surely is, for, behold, she is caught in the famous snare, the zodiac Having been proved by Adam, Cain, Noah, and his own father, she will doubtless make an excellent wife for Isaac ! Rebekah was the daughter of Bethuel (God's house, or Aries, or the Ram's house = spring equinox). Bethuel was the son of Nahor (Aries being the first constellation after winter). She resided in Haran (see Zodiac), and was therefore a Canaanite. Eliezer (Helping-Ram = Aries setting) followed 
     * The Horoscope of the astrologers was always in the East, where Aries is found at the end of the year. Therefore, as Sarah died when Virgo set, the Sun (Abraham > must necessarily appear at the East in or near Aries, in order to see his wife die. Milton Woolley.
The god that will provide, is the Ram in this story.  This Ram god was called Jupiter-Amun/Ammon/Amen, in Africa."

In relation to one of the questions - the problem is that we let the left define things. They moved the fascists & Nazis from the left, where it is, to the right.

UgxAI-Oq3GzvODXUPup4AaABAg,Sibyl Vane,1511233985322,"As always, very interesting. 

However, I think that Dr Peterson in his interpretations lean too much on the concept of ""to he who has shall be given"", i.e. a person is in command of his own future/happiness. I think Christendom, alone of all religions, emphasizes that salvation is only possible through the grace of God - no matter how good you are or what you do. I.e. a rich man is not rich because of his virtues, nor is a poor man poor because of his sins. Jesus was together with tax collectors and whores - who were not less children of God than the high priest in the temple of Salomon. This also means that sacrifices will neither appease nor aggravate God's mercy.

Also, compare the book of Job: The first time this concept - that a poor, unfortunate soul, MAY STILL be in God's favour and not subject to His wrath."

Ugznu0ODrlT2-Lieo5B4AaABAg,Gerald McFarlin,1508555590634,"We now approach the most remarkable act of Abraham's whole life — the attempted assassination of his only son, Isaac; and this simply by the command of God! The analogy between this and the crucifixion of our Savior is readily seen: but of this in its proper place. Having prepared all things necessary and marched within three days' (three months') journey of the place pointed out by God (Aries setting), he left his two servants (the spring equinox and summer solstice) with his ass,* while he (the Sun) and Isaac (summer) went forward. Poor Isaac wondered where was the sacrifice, but his father assured him all was right — that God (Aries setting) would provide it; and so he did; for he, God, the Earth, was the sacrifice and Isaac as well. ""And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son"" (Gen. xxii, 10). Wonder what the poor boy thought of his pious daddy, when he saw the glittering blade poised above him! But the Lord called, and Abraham looked, and ""behold a Ram caught in a thicket by his horns"" (Aries was then setting head-first), which he seized and offered instead of his son. Thus, as the Sun went down below the fall equinox, were the Lord (summer), Abraham (the Sun), God (Aries), and Isaac and all the rest of 'em sacrificed and pitched into Hell (winter) together! * 
   
 * The ass, a star so named, is in Cancer, where the summer solstice occurs. This ass, of course, the Sun always, as he passes Cancer, leaves behind. Our Savior (the Sun) rode into Jerusalem (summer solstice) on this very ass, and one other in the same constellation, called by the sacred writer ""the foal of an ass."" Balaam failed to get his ass beyond, and brought an everlasting stigma on his name because of his brutal treatment of his ass — ""the ass rebuked him"" (Num. xxiii, 28) Milton Woolley."
UgxC8ATWHqRi9vvfNkB4AaABAg,Patrick Thomas,1508555590637,the questioner at about 2:00:00 is re-asking what I see both believers and atheist asking and the question really bothers me because both want him to answer one way or the other to discredit one part of his teachings (which are more like simple speculation on psychological significance than actual teaching lessons) or another.  It bothers me because he(Dr. Peterson)* is giving from what I can see very reasonable explanation of these stories* that should satisfy both secular and religious thinkers.  What does it matter what he believes?  For a scientist what they believe should play as little to no part of how they perceive and interpret their observations.  It seems to me Dr. Peterson is aware of this a trying very hard not to take a stance on belief one way or the other; or maybe at least to mitigate his own beliefs as much as possible.  This need for others to assign him as a christian or atheist or anything at all is part of people's confirmation bias that feels the need to label someone as either allies or enemies based on stance and ignore the value of the words themselves.  It bothers me coming from both sides of the debate.  Which in my opinion the debate should not even exist; it devalues both science and religion by suggesting they are at odds with each other when really they are just different subjects.   It is like suggesting Math is at odds with Shakespeare.

There were moments when I just read on like a little kid that was introduced to a horrific idea (I presume I looked like that because that's how I felt).

But the problem of Christ is coming like a slow train and as Paul says, ""but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles"". Does Jordan Peterson have what it takes to ""Go Full Retard""? I think he does, but he would lose all his followers... He avoids Catholic mystics, theologians and the writings of Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger like the black plague. And this is the key to the lock he is trying to pick! He could take Jung's Universal Consciousness and run with it as no one has. The Greek word for Universal is catholic. There is no getting around it. Time to cross the Rubicon, Jordan!"

We bring people and animals to the here and now and leave a lump of meat back there.

Ugzgsbq9hFQT5fCMgNd4AaABAg,Daedalus 29z,1505963593083,"Jordan, I believe I understand the primary meaning of the near sacrifice of Isaac. I believe it is directly related to what you said in an earlier lecture regarding the true interpretation of the statement ""the meek shall inherit the Earth"". You said the word 'meek' is incorrect, it actually means ""to have a sword and yet keep it sheathed."" Merely the act of possessing a sword means one has the capability of doing something monstrous; the capability of comitting the ultimate of heinous acts. So it is precisely those who are aware of the monster within, aware of what they are capable of, but are able to wield that power properly, showing restraint, who shall inherit the earth. God said to Abraham, ""I will make you a father of many nations."" Truly, Abraham and his generations are inheriting the Earth. So what I am left with is that the near sacrifice of Isaac is indicative of the properly 'meek' man. He knows he is capable of the monstrous. He knows anything, anything would be better than that sacrifice. And yet for the highest good, he is willing to make it. He is willing to unsheath his sword. And so, the final intervention by God is something along the lines of, ""The man who is willing to unsheath his sword, yet waits until the last possible moment to do so, when it only becomes absolutely essential, may be spared the sacrifice by God."" Don't give up until it's absolutely necessary."

How do the Feminists put it, what is personal is political.....

Politics don't need to be left vs right, or any other conflict between different personalities, but it can alude to giving soul ontological priority (which can observe personalities) and not any perticular personality......

The classification of politics as left vs right (or between any other expression of personality) is not a proper classification, it doesn't have to be that way......

Violence Unveiled: Humanity at the Crossroads Paperback – Nov 1 1996
by Gil Bailie (Author)

This text is a response to someone named 'Rene' to wit.  I haven't read the work to which Baille is responding.

For a quick summation, his thesis is that Christianity has permanently altered the fundamental assumptions of humanity, not wholly for the positive.  The story of the Cross has shifted sympathy from the oppressor to the victim.

His theory says that as religion loses it's sense of the sacred to the encroaching modern world, that the search for religious sacrifice and scapegoats will increase, and will become increasingly unsatisfying, requiring ever greater sacrifices, until a dominant violence emerges, restoring normaility and restarting the cycle.  Christianity, Baillie says has upset that cycle.

I don't agree with all of his conclusions, but there is a lot of solid truth to his thought process.  I don't know if this text would be useful to you, at your level, or if you haven't learned it's precepts already.  It has done a lot for my thought process, such as what is really happening with burning of flags and other effigies at public rallies.."

Don't worry, you're not the only one who can see it. far from the only one... i dissagree with you on a few points, but thats not why i am writing this comment to you(you are trying to preserve this civilization on the exact same values it was founded on, as far as i am conserned this civilization is in its current state because some of those values are deeply flawed, some... not all, but some are real spanners.) to me you seem to be quite the optimist, optimism is a good perspective to have when you have to debate ""the horde"" face first everyday. I like the connections you make in things and the architypes you see, your brain must be working overtime to think up the things you do. But your sources, as in to say some of those religious texts even though interpretation is an art that can border along the lines of infinity(which is both good and bad.) itself, some of those texts/philosophys/theologies are litterally designed to turn people into slaves and open up the best of us to be exploited by the worst of us. That's all they're about, power, control and mind games. You can extract wisdom from them, but some of them were made to be deeply malevolent things and they damage society as a whole each and every day with the core concepts that proliferate though peoples lives. You read up on hitler, i'm sure he must of said some true things in his time here on earth, and you can reinterpret or reframe his words to say some quite profound things about the nature of human existence. but what he wanted was power and glory, and he was willing to do some pretty messed up things (by his own standards) to get that, infact in reality, power and glory was all he actually cared about. so it is important to never forget what someone or something actually is, if you are going to draw wisdom from them. annother example would be the native north american tribes, its a possitive gold mine there, but they definitely weren't cultrally angels, especially by todays standards. why do you think there are so many neo nazis out there, it's got to be more than indoctrination and bigotry. So this is my warning to you Mr Peterson: ""Be carefull, that you do not summon what you venerate."" hitler wasn't the only one that slaughtered people out of turn."

Ugz9W1-AN8WmldtC-5t4AaABAg,Marcara081,1505963617417,"So you wanna be a cultural Christian? You wanna know what the merit of Christianity is? I'll unpack just TWO WORDS for you:

Why does the bible command us to 'fear god?'

Because God represents truth. Period. Whether you believe in God or not, look at it that way.  If God is what's true, he's what's real. That doesn't mean he's everything good and bad or nice or frightening. It only means that he's everything that is. Your -interpretation of what is doesn't matter. He's only everything that has happened to you and will happen to you. There isn't any moral content there though, since it's not a matter of what ought to happen or shouldn't happen. It's what did and what does.

So do you fear the truth? Yes, you do. Why? Because you're inherently self-righteous. There is some belief you have that creates a foundation for yourself that isn't true. In fact, all beliefs are like that. Everything you believe about yourself is a lie in some fashion. You don't quite understand what you are or who you are. You have labels for things, but delve into your understanding of those labels and you'll find some gap in your understanding. So you fear God in that he threatens to reveal the untruth, the lies you have about yourself or the biases you have or whatever.

But at the same time, the truth is not a malevolent threat. It merely exists. It's just an 'is' and you're afraid of it.

So then, if the truth isn't malevolent, how is it benevolent? Because it's knowing the truth that best assists you in literally everything. No matter how awful reality has become, it's understanding that reality that best equips you for it. So yeah, what's real can be awful and devastating and all sorts of bad, but it's only understanding it that will help you overcome it. Not knowing why it's happening will lead to ruin. Deceiving yourself into believing it's something other than it is will lead to ruin.

So indeed, you have a fearful relationship to the truth. But you also have an adoring one, a loving one, a thankful one, an honorable one and a respectful one. Even regarding the worst thing that happens to you, it's only the truth that will allow you to overcome it. The truth of the origin of your depression. The truth of of WMDs in Iraq. The truth of which way to escape a burning building. It. Does. Not. Matter.

The truth is always honest with us by definition. It's our relationship to truth that creates all these different feelings towards it.

The reason 'fear' was chosen as the ultimate phrasing for this relationship is because it allows for all the others, but also puts us in our place with regard to truth. We have to submit to it. We're nothing in comparison to it. We owe it our survival. We owe it everything. It's not terrifying in the sense that it will harm us. It's terrifying in the scope of it's power. It's the sort of terror or awe that's inspired by a power beyond comprehension. And yes, we naturally fear that. Something beyond comprehension MEANS we can't ever understand it and thus the truth CANNOT prevail us - totally. So the truth - the ULTIMATE TRUTH i.e. God, is inherently terrifying to us. But he's no threat.

Like the universe or reality itself. Contemplated in all it's majesty - if we could, would drive us insane. Yet, comprehending it is exactly what we must do to survive.

The reason Peterson talks of self-knowledge and death as the same thing, is because he's talking about shedding the ego such that we're able to better understand reality without bias. Christians phrase this as 'receiving God'. So as I see it, it's 'receiving truth'. Of course, there is no better way to receive the truth then when you eliminate your biases, your self-righteousness. But since the self is based on these biases, you have to 'die' in order to better receive truth. You have to give up the old biases, the old self-righteousness, and be REBORN as someone more humble. Someone less self-righteous and so more willing to understand truth.

Hence the DEATH AND REBIRTH of Jesus as man's salvation.

This is impossible to do since we've all some self-righteousness by design. Descartes proved that. (Cogito ergo sum). So instead, this 'new life' is one of introspection and vigilance against the self - the ego. So now whenever you're keen to believe something or impose something as true, essentially to assume or presume something, you stop yourself. Yes, you're always going to have the tendency to assume things and you're always going to have old assumptions you didn't purge. But so long as you remain vigilant you can take on less new assumptions and remove more old assumptions and so move closer to truth.

And that ladies and gentlemen, is the EXACT same relationship we have toward truth when engaging the scientific method. We're agnostic about everything 'real' and the entire exercise is trying to prove ourselves wrong. Trying to prove where we've got the model wrong - which is true by definition, rather than trying to prove ourselves right.

The current model is always wrong. It's not 'incomplete' until you find where it was wrong. Where Newtonian Physics didn't work anymore or whatever. Then you hopefully fill in that gap (General Relativity in this case), and then you proceed to find where relativity is wrong and then determine the model to be incomplete once more.

See, any belief you have is wrong. It's incomplete - always. You have to challenge that belief to discern so in the first place and then take on a more true perspective should you discern how it was WRONG. Then you do it again and again. It's the death and rebirth cycle of Jesus. Over and over and yes, like the bible says, it moves you closer to God i.e. truth.

And people still don't understand why science erupted from Christian Europe. Good Lord.

The Individual never encounters God but through abstraction and dialect; but this abstraction and transcendence could only be possible had not all other Being existed as a primary. 
(Taking God as an apriori concept of all Man, potentially to be actualized through Nature)

I used to think the act of sitting down and bowing your head along with others at the same Altar conveyed a very narrow and undeserved sense of altruism. Why the fuck would you worship the same exact way for years on end? I now see that venturing into the land of the Stranger, while sometimes terrifying, is the most gracious sense of worship. For the simple definition that it's strange, or unknown territory therefore always guaranteeing a novel experience of the Individual encountering the Divine."

Ugwn-iNzr-eofEI3r9p4AaABAg,El Rilla,1505963622053,"I'd like for Prof. Peterson to do a study on love as it is revealed in Scripture.  I think the missing element of his solution to the problem of suffering is understanding how Being itself is love.  Purpose--although important--is not what keeps a person sane in the chaos of life because one still has to deal with one's inadequacy as an imperfect human being while they pursue their aims.  You can only learn how to accept yourself once you've understood that you are loved in spite of your inadequacies and that the pursuit of the infinite (aiming high as he would put it) is inspired by what one is loved by.  With that said, a transcendent, intelligent God--which theologians will say is the bedrock of Being or is Being itself--necessary because only an intelligent, thinking Being can love.

Aiming high is sometimes a scheme that tries to get people to love oneself--the idea being that if you are inadequate, you are not loved but if you are a noble hero, then you're respected and loved by the other."

R.W. Carstens ""Notes on Humanity: Faith, Reason, Certainty"". 

Coupled with Peterson's imaginative look at the archetypal stories of the bible, you will be absolutely steeped in what the humanities are meant to have taught you. This man's intellect is staggering as well, and he and Peterson have several overlapping ideas. That's how you know they are both correct."

Ugw5zZWcnH_SHXZiedh4AaABAg,Czech MGTOW,1505963622108,"Hi Dr. Peterson,
I'm a fan and a Patreon supporter of yours. I believe your cause is just and your intentions noble.

However, after watching some of this latest Bible Series video, it seems to me that you might be unknowingly promoting a message which is not so noble.

You looked very moved by the story of Abraham and Isaac where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son. I don't quite understand why - the story seems reprehensible to me. I know you bashed MGTOW in the past and have since apologized for it, but maybe you still don't understand the underlying principle (that only few people have mental capacity to fully comprehend). Were the story of Abraham and Isaac told by someone genuinely ""going his own way"", the events would play out very differently.

Abraham's response to the god requesting the sacrifice would be met with a resolute ""no"". Abraham would have replied to god: ""No, I will not do that. I was given free will to choose and decide my own values, my own course of life. And I will not compromise what I hold dear. You - a god - have given me this free will, this freedom to make any choice I want. Even you - as a god and as my creator - have to take responsibility for this decision of yours, and you have to suffer the consequences of it - my disobedience to you. If you want to, simply undo my free will, undo my life. You make your own choices and so do I. I am ready to suffer the consequences. Are you?""

To me, the Christian version of the story is about two aspects of human biology (psychology). Male disposability (the story wouldn't ""work"" so well in case Abraham was asked to sacrifice his daughter) and unconditional subservience to some authority. The question is - how much does the bible merely depict these two natural(?) things, and how much does it try to further ingrain this into people's minds in order to turn them into even more obedient and expendable sheep - essentially becoming a tool of brainwashing and crowd control?

In case humanity is stuck with this slave morality, how far can it really advance? You seem to be a big fan of individualism... How is the story of blindly obedient Abraham aligned with that? It looks more like a contradiction to me. This must cause quite a dissonance in your mind at times, doesn't it?

Please, give the above a thought. Not for the sake of me, or MGTOW. But for the sake of a better future humanity - transcendence of our own psychological limitations. We don't need to be stuck in the same loop forever, like a broken record.

Thank you."

It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David.       2 Samuel 24:25 25David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

Holy Nuts! I have for a long time thought and hoped that acquired traits could be passed down to one's offspring (epigenetic research indicates that this is at least true for sperm that seem to be able to ""memorize"" acquired traits of the father). I thought this was true considering that despite the billions of years that passed, random mutations by themselves just can't numerically account for why animals seem so evolutionarily fit for their environment. There just hasn't been enough time, and who's to say that a specific mutation will help a species survive better. I hoped that acquired characteristics would at least, no matter how minute, be able to point the random mutations in a direction to help a species to better evolutionary survivability. 
This is HUGE! Because in essence, our wills can be passed down genetically. You, at least the men (maybe future research will find that eggs can learn acquired traits as well), can affect how smart or how fit your kids will be by making yourself smarter and more fit despite your genetic predisposition. So in the big scheme, females are responsible for the continuation of species by generation, and males are responsible, through the crucible of the dominance hierarchy, nature, and the selection of women, for making the species evolve and be more survivable in the long run. Wow!!! And here I thought male competence was no longer needed in the west via media programming. Holy Nuts indeed."

UgzuZXb-zbecegtk1K94AaABAg,lGalaxisl,1503285243670,"So if I get this correct, the sacrifice of isaac is similar to the death of the father as a precursor to growing up. You become a man when your father dies, Jung said this can be a symbolic death. So you have to sacrifice the representation of father so that there is nothing between you and the unknown. 

Similarly, Abraham had to sacrifice the representation of his son so that his son could become a real man."
Ugy56kz2X1cF37WR0GZ4AaABAg,"The Merr, Roo2U & Yasha too",1503285243680,"Is it possible that the sacrifice of Isaac has been expressed as a literal death sacrifice was really a willingness to give up (sacrifice) the child into service (ministry) for God.  Abraham proved he was willing to give up (sacrifice) his son into service.  At the time, Isaac's service wasn't needed, because there wasn't a ""huge nation"" to serve.  However, we see this actual sacrifice being made by Samuel's mother who struggled to have a child of her own, but once she did she was willing, once Samuel was old enough, to sacrifice her son, to the Tribe of Levi into public service in the name of God.

This event of Abraham and Isaac, was a foreshadowing of the law of sacrificing the first born sons to God (into public service as ministers of God, public servants) or the requirement to buy them back for a burnt sacrifice of a certain amount of money/property.

How hard would it be for a father and mother to give up their first born son, at the age of 8 or so, to go live their life in the temple, learning how to be a minister, or servant of the people through a life of public service?

People make burnt sacrifices today all the time.  Burnt meaning: given up entirely, no strings or sinew attached.  Sacrifice = offering, free will giving.  many people give offerings, but they are not burnt sacrifices, they keep strings of control attached so that they can say how ""their"" money is used by the ones they give to.  Taxes to government are a better example of a true burnt sacrifice, taxes are given up entirely and the government decides how to use those tax revenues, however, civil excise taxes are not free will offerings, they are compelled by contractual nexuses and consent of the corporate members of the civil body politic.

God = EL or Theos = a mighty one of authority, a law giver/maker, a ruling judge, a sovereign power.  The Aleph was a picture of an ox head with horns representing power, premiere, first, and the Lamed, the picture of a shepherd's staff representing authority, a powerful authority, which is why the bible states their are ""god's many"" and even why The Christ quotes the OT and says, ""is it not written in your law, ye are gods?""

There are many civil fathers and gods: Uncle Sam is a mighty one of authority, a law maker, a ruling judge, a sovereign power.

Could CAIN have been tilling up ADAMAH, red clay, MEN, getting the offerings he held up to GOD off the back's of the citizen members of his city-state Enoch?   While Abel was a good shepherd of MEN, in a voluntary society who followed Abel as a titular leader, and the offerings of Abel were giving up freely, voluntarily, as loving burnt sacrifices, which is why they were acceptable to the LORD, but Cain's tilled up offerings (force, duress, compelled performance) were not?"

As for this being an excuse for abusers, a little thought shows that it doesn't imply this at all... if there is no injustice, then they will have to pay for every moment of the abuse, and those who are being abused must be paying for past abuses.

Ugzws04LTclve9eHjPJ4AaABAg,Kon Berner,1503285246796,"I liked the section from about 45:00 to 50:00 . I think this gets close to right on among the most important issues in political philosophy, but the terms need even more clarity. First there is sharing as trading. Are these really the same? Then there is this term ""generous sharing"". How does that fit in with trading? Then there is the question about sharing intended as a gift instead of a trade. Then there is the idea of sacrifice both giving something up, but not really because you are doing it as part of getting more... is this really a sacrifice? I think that once these nuances are looked at more closely, the core ideas of voluntary trade and effective planning will come to the surface as the keys. 

I do agree that working with feelings around sacrifice--the fear of it--and examining the entire topic is important. However, ultimately, there is no productive sacrifice, since the net effect has to be beneficial in order for it to be productive. If the net effect is beneficial, then where is the sacrifice? It was an illusion... this is even (or especially) true if what is being sacrificed is pride, domination, pushiness, fear and other completely destructive emotions that block productivity: this sacrifice of love of misconceptions is, I agree, very important. 

The real root issue is, as you did imply, if a productive (positive and loving and collaborating) or destructive (negative and greedy and dominating) approach to life is what is embraced. Everything flows from this choice."

God was telling Abraham that you need to show me beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're all in -- that you're committed to me. You love your son, I understand that, but you need to understand that your son is a gift from me; Issac would not exist unless I had made it possible. So God ordered Abraham to sacrifice Issac to prove that Abraham loved God more than he loved Issac. The fact that God tells Abraham to stop the moment that he was actually gonna do it, illustrates the point that God only wanted to know that Abraham was willing to do it. He then provides the lamb to Abraham, sacrificing it in place of Issac -- symbolism for how Jesus would one day be the sacrificial lamb that would take YOUR place. 

Anyone who actually thinks God wanted Issac to die is missing the point."

I want to point out that Dr. Peterson once remarked, on the topic of telling lies, that acting out a lie is “the same damn thing” as actually telling one.

What makes you so damn sure that living out the truth (“enacting a contractual relation with the highest good”, let us say) must not likewise be “the same damn thing” as stating and believing it?  

Obviously there is a distinction; I am challenging the notion that there is a separation such that “what you believe” can ever be “beside the point”.  What you act out implies doctrinal content as much as held doctrines demand to be acted out.  Our will and intellect are distinct, but not separate.  
Is it likely that this applies only to lies, but not to a belief/doctrine that involves integrity?  Is lying stronger and more necessarily coherent than integrity?"

Now just imagine, you are witnessing this man, claiming to be the Son of God, being crucified unto death. Then all of a sudden, this Man begins to sing the first line of a song, that you and the rest of your culture are very familiar with and have been for over 800 years.

A human cannot change the fact that they are human, and the human animal comes with trends that, as you mentioned, cannot be completely changed. However, no two humans are exactly the same, and most have significant differences around values of various kinds.

Therefore, in the process of coming to embrace one's own values , which is a better term I think, this will always involve both the personal and inherent aspects of one's being.

Genesis 17: 3-6 ""Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 4 “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. 5 No longer will you be called Abram[b]; your name will be Abraham,[c] for I have made you a father of many nations. 6 I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. ""

Yet the sacrifice of the son seems to be very counterproductive. How Abraham can be the father of a nation if he has to sacrifice his only son? The sacrifice didn't seem to be suitable for the promise and even further to say that this sacrifice seems to aim to the opposite direction of the goal .  At the end , we learn that it was a test of faith. Indeed the inheritance and promise go through his son and his descendants. 

Imagine that indeed Abraham did sacrifice his son, slaughtered him and offered him to the burn offering. How he could become then the ""father of many nations""? 
Would God help Abraham conceive again a new son? Would God help Abraham adopt a non-biological son? Would Abraham elect someone as his successor?"

Nice! I recently thought: If I could ask Professor Peterson a question, I would ask him what he thinks is the meaning of worship, and whether we loose something by not worshiping God. 
I think that was a perfectly sensible answer: So how then can we simply just not worship God?
Of course worship involves symbolic actions, but why should we assume it is purely symbolic? The Professor mentioned a couple lectures ago how just because something in the Bible is metaphorical, that doesn't mean the metaphor exhausts the truth of it. 

Perhaps worship was developed in part to help us to learn to make sacrifices, to renounce immediate gratification for the future--but what has happened since we've abandoned worshiping God? People continue to use the skills they gained, but now to renounce immediate gratification for even greater future self-gratification. We're never too sophisticated to worship God."
