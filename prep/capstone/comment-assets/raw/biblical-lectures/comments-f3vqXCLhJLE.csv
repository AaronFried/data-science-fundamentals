To further the discussion he needs to read Julian Jaynes' book The Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Although Dr. Jaynes doesn't talk about psychadelics, I believe that the hyperconnection between the hemispheres cause the two  to compete. The right hemisphere seems to break through into the linguistic interpretation of the experience, as in what we call the subconscious presents itself into a spoken manifestation."

UgyPjQ0z0VflbfhNKDZ4AaABAg,mikecorbeil,1524279812567,"Metaphors in the Bible ?  There are none, maybe if you think the original writers meant what they wrote literally, in which case we could still think of a lot of it as metaphorical (at best for much of the text).  But if a person doesn't blindly believe all of that text, that story-telling literally, then we can find metaphor, i.e., some symbolism or understandable meaning.  When it comes to the story of Adam, Eve, Cain and Able, and them being the first family of all of humanity, then don't complain about incest, because humanity couldn't have formed any other way.  Take that analysis further and you'll conclude that all humans against incest are hypocrites, but the story of Adam, Eve, etc., is FABLE; and no, God didn't create this world 6,000 years ago.  The Old Testament very much is metaphorically understandable in some respects and, imo, some isn't at all believable or acceptable.  The Bible was NOT written, etc., by God, and anyone who thinks otherwise is idiot.  People should NOT fault God for human errors!  Anyway, that stuff is quite plainly understandable, and yes, applying psychology to the study of the Bible is good, if it's well done, but people should also apply the ""scientific method"" as used in the physical sciences.  When we apply all of these sciences, social and physical, then Bible study becomes more interesting; and it ""makes sense"" to take or apply these approaches.  After all, we're only humans."

He seems to make the point that if a man marries his sister you turn back to where you cam from as in your parents and don't progress into the next step, but Sarai never was Abraham's sister, he only pretended for her to be his sister to not be killed.

UgzCnIPRb3_uEB6c9qx4AaABAg,Sezi Mik,1513825424808,"If the idea of order and chaos is so embedded in us that we can see it as a threat in the form of reptilian predators not only it can reveal the impact of water in the form of source of life it may also be related to the fear of being hunted by reptilian predators: something like crocodiles in the Nile or the rivers near Mesopotamians . It can also be traced all the way back to chimpanzees in Africa which if is true can reveal one of the oldest collective memories and the formation of consciousness. But whatever the story it has had a huge permanent impact on human nature. It could be so powerful that could have even forced human to develop languages.  . Also water has a strong relationship with the concept of exile. as creatures that came out of water and had to constantly go back to and live near masses of water, our feeling of thirst is nothing but exile. Also, the act of exile/migration inhabits an unconscious or forced motion backed by a piece of information. the more obvious the information the smaller the chaos.  

The idea of movements and motions plays an important role in the development of consciousness . I always think that motion represents the existence of its creator or concept or god. in the other words, It is the physical expression of information and has/creates direction. of course it can be random, but random walking creatures have no future in nature (maybe that's why post modernism does not have any specific direction). nothing is free in nature and for every step you have to either make a decision or have a piece of information to help you predict the outcome of your motion and movement otherwise you spend your energy without gaining energy. for example, bacteria move based on their perception and information of the possible food resources. or plants move towards light for gaining energy (Gepetto and looking at the sky). everything , chemical ions, light, gravity, etc that cause imbalance , edge or desire in us can be information and will force us to pick a side.

motion in any form and scale is the fruit of information. fruits are the fruit of plants knowing the light :). It is so rooted in the description of life that we cannot ignore it, even in the form of color change or slow growth. The idea of the north and the south and its references to north African  areas may refer to the life style of the tribes and villages  20000 years ago. That era could last for several thousands years of stability and the development of a culture until a sudden climate change and the growth of deserts and dry lands in Africa or spread of a diseases caused human to decide to move to northern parts. 

No one can forget an interesting or vital piece of information that can contribute to his/her life. That is the concept behind lust and shame and morality.  Information creates judgement and motion. So when you receive information you process it to see if you are interested to it and if it is aligned with you  to obtain the benefit , food, a better mate, matter and energy.  your body and every cell based creature should move to fight entropy and gain resources. Also you may have seen that chimpanzees and baboons in Africa touch , drag or move parts of the dead  members to check/understand if they are dead. knowing causes motion/migration and motion creates chaos and demands sacrifice.  

 what ever the reason is, the grief and exile in the stories reminds me of the existence of an external force. something that call or force human to move , migrate, choose, sacrifice and enter chaos for a better future. nobody would pick chaos until it was necessary.I think that can describe the grief behind the elements of the religious stories.  The strong connection of these stories with water, migration/exile, and  the relation between Egypt and our image of earth may come from our old collective memories about the birthplace of the first cultures and collective memories in north Africa and south of middle east. 

The interesting thing about Mohammad the prophet is that he somehow understood the cause of all the previous stories way earlier than anybody and came up with a remedy for the people who where caught in an extremely minimalistic chaotic environment that the slightest error would cause death. and in fact I think that's why he called himself the last prophet because he extracted all the necessary ideas of the previous stories and narrated the story and stood outside of the game. In Jesus story you can still observe that he became an story himself but Mohammad created a nation (moving to Medina from Mecca) through exile and a lot of sacrifices. I also believe that the extreme living conditions and also the social intelligence and awareness of the people in Mohammad's era demanded him to even share this information in poetic forms of commands and rules which would guarantee the survival. I'm not a religious person but I have always been interested in Mohammad's worldview and how he understood the principles and created motion and social mobility by creating commands which were based in pop culture(ancient stories, biblical stories) and some basic social behaviors rooted in economics, hygiene, etc. It would be great if Jordan Peterson could share his thoughts on Mohammad and Quran.

By the way, I really enjoyed this conversation.Thank you all"
Ugzi8fH_l35zZpLKhE14AaABAg,Marvin Carlson,1513825424816,"This looks much like what I went through preparing lectures. Chemistry Physics and Mathematics are difficult to make manifest in the minds eye of people. I spent years first as a Teaching assistant setting up experiments to demonstrate principles making the manifest in the world.  The reality of mathematics and its relation to the physical world.  Next in research  I learned the setting up of new experiments and the operation of machine tools, files hammers soldering, glass blowing, ceramics  and welding.  Next as an Engineer Designing not only new aircraft, but clarifying principles and solving problems that has been tried for 40 years, and because of my practical knowledge as well as my advanced degrees in science (Physics and Chemistry) I was able to see that the path of the previous 40 years was a dead end.Upon starting over I solved the problem in 6 months. Even then I found that the solution was not fully developed and left me with more questions than answers. The project ended because a working test instrument ( measuring within +/- 5% accuracy)was all that would be financed. 
 Teaching after a personal journey in the subject(s)taught is quite different than the common academic who has never actually made a living off of applying the principles being taught.

UgzLdCpW-lW3a9s547B4AaABAg,The2tlc,1513825424835,"28:34 Another way you can look at it and explain it is from a biological view. It's well known the side effects, birth defect, and devastating outcomes it can be on a biological level for an organism, not designed to reproduce with it's self or very closely related organism, to continuously procreate together. So, it could be more easily explained that in doing so, you are undoing the biological advancements that had occurred up until that point. You’re taking them apart or taking steps backwards. The flaws in the organism that could have been overcome by new and different genes no longer get that new input and are getting amplified instead to be come more apparent and more debilitating to the point the organism simply can no longer function and be saved. The organism has become too corrupt in the eyes of the creator to be salvaged and therefore no longer in it's image to be worthy to save and dies off into oblivion.

I'm not a religious person, but I can look at the world and see that there is a vast diversity of people and understand that there must have been a reason for that. We wouldn't have evolved to bee so different if there wasn't some kind of biological selection for it. So, I always scratch my head when 1 group claims over another only they were created in the image of God and because this other group looks so different, therefore they are not Gods creation and therefore not worthy of saving or treating with the same respect. If God created everything, and he made no mistakes because he is perfect and something everyone should aspire to become. Than it shouldn't matter what we look like, because we are all made in his image and are all his creations so who are you to pass judgment upon someone that doesn't look like you or think like you, or agree or disagree to things you agree or don't agree with? We are not God and therefore cannot pass judgment on who is or it's worthy of life. 

I do feel some people do such horrible actions they deserve death, and I think some people deserve to sit in a jail cell and have a horrible miserable life for years and years for what they did. Not to mention a very strong incentive to deter other would be criminals to consider what they’ll lose if they act on their inappropriate desires and impulses. I also think I don't have the right to dictate to anyone how much hardships and suffering they must endure in their life before it's acceptable for me to agree with their decision to end their life. It's their life and if they wish to end it, that is there choice and their judgment to face with their God come that time.

I do enjoy how you have taken these bible stories and put them into context outside a theological view point only and one more of a (non-religious) view to explain the core and moral meaning of the stories being told in the bibles context. With the decline in faith, or as you have commented on “The death of God” the root of the stories still is valid and have strong meanings and ramifications for a functioning society, even if you don’t believe in a divinity. The ideas and implications are still relevant and sometimes I feel those implications, importance, simplicity at times, and relevance gets disregarded simply because of the connection to a divinity or God. Instead of seeing it as bases for a solid core of fundamental building blocks to a solid and stable society that can allow everyone willing to participate, contribute, and maintain it, the ability to flourish and be rewarded for their efforts."

Missler teaches a rather more serious view on the Bible mixed with some interesting historical and scientific findings and I appreciate one of the things he teaches that he himself learned, ""Metaphors reign where mystery resides.""

In watching the relationships and talking to them about these things , the one thing I can say is, if one is gay, have fun with that, but be responsible.  One of my friends is in and out of relationships, and is miserable.  An awesome person, but makes the same mistakes hetero couples do.  Both the others are in stable single relationships, but they take them seriously, again, just like a bunch of hetero folks do.

I think being in that type of relationship is much akin to how you tell women that it is 1 in a 1000 that will want to be working 80 hours a week and all that jazz.  I have known these folks over 20 years, and in the beginning they were all in rocky, partying type affairs, in that they were doing the coupling at random into their 30s, which, I would think stops with hetero folks earlier and they want more stable relationships.   Its that growing up thing, and I think that starts when we start thinking of having kids which is not a danger for homosexuals, so I think that kind of commitment comes in later stages and they may adopt, which one of my friends has done.

I do not think religiosity has anything that can help the person you talked of one way or another.  If they believe it is a sin, then it is, if they do not believe it is a sin because they do not believe in a god that would make it a sin, then it is one of self imposed sin if there is confusion, and thats a dragon worth slaying.  

I personally hope the person finds someone they can be happy with and just say how one has sex is only one aspect compared to all the other chores we have to do, and having a loving partner helps lessen that pain"

UghM3Uv4XLhm0HgCoAEC,Andrew Rodriguez,1503284639218,"Dr. Peterson, I really loved this discussion, as I come from a similar perspective as the Pageau brothers.  The Bible actually opens up its meaning even more when we view it simultaneously literally and symbolically.  That's how I interpreted Jung when I first read Man & His Symbols in 10th grade. 

A few thoughts: Re your brief discussion on Hagar: the lesson is not that Abram had Ishmael as a trial run, but that he diverged from the path God set for him by trying to accomplish a divine destiny by human methodology. He was relying on his own efforts to bring about God's plan.  Note where Hagar is from: Egypt, which as Mathieu pointed out, represents the Earth (carnal, uninspired thinking).

Re your last discussion, about the sexual confusion in our culture, especially as I think about the friend you described: I hope more intellectuals, therapists, and educators begin catching on to this as well.  Maybe then they'll finally understand the reason to allow for alternative therapies for egodystonic same-sex attraction other than just gay-affirmative therapy (such as Yarhouse and Throckmorton's sexual identity therapy or Nicolosi's reparative therapy).
Lastly, if you've never looked into it, I would highly recommend checking out Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body (look up Christopher West)."

In this case, it means if we want to be successful, we learn and respect our ancestors, and what they did, so much that we do not hide their shame, but learn from it, and ""cover"" for it with our own effort.  We effectively modify the system we inherit from our parents but not overthrow it.  Ham, however, was cursed, because he rejected his Father, and therefore everything his Father taught him too.  This means Ham overthrew his parents system, their wisdom, out of his own hubris.

Ugg6bim_FhMBBXgCoAEC,Susan Baker,1503284643419,"Great point about being in the cave of materialism! Plus, another point that Dr. Peterson brings up about so-called ""sexual liberation"": Libertinism is not liberty; anarchy leads to its own excuse for tyranny. Related point: libertarians broke off from conservatives politically because they prefer not to abide by the virtuous right (absolute, objective principles of righteousness from God that USA was founded on and the West adapted to.) However, liberty, like beauty, is not its own excuse for being which libertinism believes. Virtue undergirds all as does truth. Knowing and abiding by that brings true freedom (liberty). Paul clarified that; both Testaments proclaimed that. Jesus embodied that for our salvation."
UgjUySakSCTQHngCoAEC,Borzumehr Toloui,1503284643427,"I can't believe the amount of misinformation spoken in this conversation. First of all, the north being up and south down is a modern notion that became prevalent after the invention of the compass. In the ancient times, including the biblical times, the 'top' was the east, where the sun rose, the orient, the qadima, and the bottom was the west, the land of the dying sun. The connotations of 'orienting' and 'orientation' is still with us from those times. Furthermore, Haran is the place Abraham was to get out of. Can't the the heaven. In fact  the return of Jacob, whose very name means twisted, is an example of this reversal and confusion. He has to go through it because of his deceit, and has his uncle pull the same kind of stunt against him as karma!. This whole 'fall' of Jacob  is itself due to the twistedness of his character in constantly looking up to Esau which is the dumber and the less virtuous of the two, instead of his own. He has his name changed only after the battle with god/his doppelegaenger sprit of his brotherand overcome it and only aftre that does he part ways with his brother in the morning and finally steps into his own path. 

I also want to point out another thing that was a bit annoying about this interview. JBP has been correctly expounding on the importance of telling the truth and facing where ever it leads you and bearing the consequences, instead of setting a desired outcome at the front and planning and manipulating everything to get it. Yet the entire thesis here is how when the ""principle"" is at odds with the facts, the purpose of everything is to re-allign the fact with the principle. Isn't that exactly the ideological mindset he was warning against? Shouldn't the principle itself be abandoned or updated to match the ""material"" fact. That is of course the way of objective science that these people are somehow always arguing against. Why is that? and why is it that you can't see the obvious inconsistency of your stances?"

The transgression of the culture of Sodom and Gomorrah was of recreation without reproduction and it destroyed a nation.  The sin of Sodom was not merely in where things were placed, but the why of it, and how the denial of reproduction is against nature and against God.  Fascinating.

Catholic teaching against contraceptives makes more sense now.  Totally going to call contraceptive users sodomites from now on.

Also of note is that in both cases the act occurs in the absence of a meaningful, unitive, loving relationship.  Relationship also seems key in all the stories so far.

Thank you so much for your Series: 
“The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories”, I’m finding it very stimulating!

I have a question about the Importance you place on the role Child Rearing plays in the Creation of a Fulfilled Life.

It seems to me that your Analysis is based on the Nuclear Family, is it not true that the Nuclear Family is a fairly modern invention and that for most of our evolution, children were raised within larger, Extended-Families, Clans, Villages, etc.

Is it not also true that Non-Breeding Individuals used to play a very important role within these societies, both in assisting the Primary-Parents in the Care of Children and also, most notably, as Medicine-Man/Woman, Shaman and Spiritual Intermediary.

Granted in our Modern, Secular Times, many of these roles have fallen away, and therefore, Non-Breeding individuals find themselves Unmoored from the Common Social Structure.

Could you think and comment on this, please?

Thank You."

UghOI60OFmeo5ngCoAEC,Mandilyn Cartwright,1503284652910,"I would like to suggest that when doing commentary on the Old Testament that you add a Rabbi, if you are able. As a follower Messianic Judaism(I believe Yeahua/Jesus was Messiah), I know 10x more about the Torah than I do the gospels. It does not mean I'm un-knowledgeable, only that my focus of study is usually Torah based. I'm not an expert. But, Rabbi's spend much of their waking life in biblical study. 
One observation: the physical presents of G-d is tapered by the emergence of written Torah, and the dependence on intellect rather than feeling faith. The more intellectual the ""believers"" become, the less reliant on physical signs. At the end of the Old Testament they have in fact twisted the Torah intellectually to mean whatever suited their own selfish desire. 
Sad, because understanding Torah intellectually can bring us closer to the feeling/connected G-d, if we are not focused on selfish ambition.

Today I was interesting in the difference between people that are entertained by mysteries/fantasies theories and people that are entertained by seeing them debunked.  I find ghost/monster stories and alien/UFO theories stupid, ridiculous and even boring. However I am very entertained by these same stories being debunked. Some people are more entertained by the 'fantastical' stories themselves. I am curious is there any good research or videos that explores the difference between people that like/are entertained by these stories vs people that are entertained by proving them false.  Is this maybe something Dr. Peterson has addressed before?  

I do not think it has to do with religious vs science because most religious people I know are skeptical and not entertained by ghost stories and etc unless it specifically confirms their belief and that is just confirmation bias, which does not seem to be the same thing.

Even in the New Testament when Jesus washes and anoints the apostles feet it follows this pattern. These cities were about to be dealt with the angels indicated it was the express reason they came. The washing of the feet of person is much like the blood of the lamb on the lintel so the destroying angel passes you by. It has to do with sealing the good up unto eternal life.

UgjsqPG8td-A3HgCoAEC,little red book,1503284657912,"Tamar was judah's eldest son's widow. As per custom, the next son"" married"" her to produce an heir for his brother (i.e. a child that would bare his brother's name), which he refused to do (he spilt his seed on the ground). Judah then said, ""wait for #3 son to grow up, of course he may die too."" 

He kept stalling, so Tamar pretended to be a shrine prostitute to get with child, asking for and receiving tokens of Judah's identity. 

When he found out that Tamar was pregnant, he threatened to burn her until she provided proof of the father (himself). 

So the story (not in the deepest sense) is about how Judah failed to supply his legal daughter a way to care for herself (in that time, a son to care for her in old age) and his son with an heir so ""his name might not disapear from the earth."" (a phrase that doesn't appear in this story but does in several places in the Bible.) 

Tamar took matters in her own hands to see both were done. 

This whole idea of a kinsman redeemer, a man who takes to wife the window of a relative in order to produce a heir for said relative and redeem the inheritance of the relative for the support of the window, is a major point in the book of Ruth."

UgjR15eU_EZnD3gCoAEC,Pandoras Library,1503284665477,"Some important aspects often overlooked about Abraham:1) he was told to leave his country and family and go to the land of inference, this is, psychologically speaking, reference to the individuation process moving towards wholeness, in that one must differentiate oneself from others and one's culture thereby gain clarity in how to properly integrate the positive aspects of one's cultural and society. 
2) a covenant is made that God is to bless Abraham so that he may be a blessing. This is the whole guiding ethos of those ego are God's people throughout the old testament.
3) when Abraham devices the pharaoh and yet is rewarded with wealth, it's indicative that, while as individuals on the path of individuation our egos may be imperfect at the task, the Self remains true covenant.
4) Abraham's is changed from Abram to Abraham this signifies the emergence of a new self that is born from the process of individuation.

UggaJUtO0wCmaHgCoAEC,Joseph Barratt,1503284669261,"These lectures aim to expound the psychological significance of the biblical stories, but entering into an analysis of the bible without recognizing that God is the subject of the bible, not man, assures misunderstanding from the get go. As in the westminster shorter catechism: ""What do the Scriptures principally teach? The Scriptures principally teach, what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man."" First what man is to believe concerning God, and, in that light, what duty God requires of him. If we turn to the scriptures first to deduce what they have to say about our psyche, we'll run into some errors. To start with, and maybe this is necessary in order for the lectures to appeal to a wide audience, if we approach the bible with a man-centric view, God becomes a filtered amalgamation of the imaginations of men, rather than the view the bible takes, that man is a fractured image of God. The result is similar, but the arrows point in different directions. Did God arise from man's imagination, or does man's imagination subsist in light of God's stamping of his image? Paul answered this to the philosophers on Mars Hill: ""Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man."" Even if one disagrees with that, I think understanding the bible requires understanding that it puts God first and man second.

Understanding the bible as a story about God helps make the continuity of the bible more evident, because he and his purposes alone remain constant across the millennia of time the bible covers. In the beginning man walked with God, but when man first sinned it was the beginning of man's rebellion against God. God did not change as he became ""more distant,"" because we know the bible says that God does not change. But God does faithfully and consistently respond to circumstances, and he executes his plans with perfect timing. I like the phrase from Isaiah, ""the least one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation; I am the LORD; in its time I will hasten it.""I like that ""in its time."" Man sinned and ate a fruit, then murder entered the story, then Lamech multiplied murder, then violence reigned on the earth, and after patiently enduring that for 120 years, God put an end to it with the flood. But it didn't take long for man to begin construction of their tower to overtake the heavens, and God dispersed them from there to stave off their rebellion. Because rebellion against God is foolhardy and ends in death. Throughout the bible man tends increasingly to rebel, and God seems farther and farther away, because neither the mark of Cain, nor the purging of the flood, nor the dispersal at Shinar, nor the destruction of Sodom, nor the rescue of the Jews from Egypt, nor the provision in the desert, nor the judges, nor the sacrifices, nor the warnings of the prophets proved effective towards ending man's rebellion against God. Even in the new testament Paul warns Timothy of godlessness in the last days, ""always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth."" Throughout all of what God did in the old testament we learned much but did not arrive at the truth. I've heard you can think of the history of redemption in one sense as an exhaustion of all possible sacrifices before the final, effective sacrifice of Jesus. Through all of it God made provision for that sacrifice so that we could understand it and praise God appropriately. Here's something helpful from Hebrews 1:

""God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.""

It shows how Jesus improves on 1. the prophets 2. the flood (as he himself purged our sins) 3. angels 4. importantly, man, as Jesus is the ""express image"" of God's person, while man is a broken image.

I think of it like a parent trying to save his son from folly, perhaps even the folly of trying to kill the parent. The parent tries everything: hands-on, hands-off, intimate chats, dire warnings, interventions via friends, giving gifts, exacting punishments, displays of power, exhausting every option. But to no avail, and in the end the parent has to make some supreme sacrifice to finally take care of all the problems and return the son to sanity. There's probably some heresy in that (e. g. God doesn't flail or experiment) so take it with a grain of salt, but it might be helpful. You don't jump to the supreme sacrifice, even if you know that it's ultimately necessary, because it wouldn't make sense to onlookers. And God works for his own glory.

Just thinking out loud."

I found the word to be careless coming from someone (Matthieu) who is purported to be an Orthodox biblical expert. Hopefully it was only careless and not what he actually thinks the Bible teaches! The Catholics describe it better as sex has both a reproductive and a UNITIVE purpose, i.e., it is physically and emotionally bonding for spouses, it is an expression of committed love in the 'one flesh' tradition of Christian marriage. The word recreation implies a casualness or frivolousness for sex that simply doesn't exist in the Judeo-Christian religious understanding.

the first mistake you make when modeling real world family trees is assuming that they will be strict trees. a real family tree will have cycles, for one because sometimes siblings or maybe just cousins do actually marry, and other weird and unfortunate things like that (father rapes daughter), but also because if your tree gets big enough then it will show how any two people are distantly related."

In fact, you'll find multiple instances in the New Testament where this occurs.  Consider Stephen's sermon in Acts that triggers his murder.  Or Peters sermon in Acts, that triggers the conversion of many.  
Peterson doesn't really understand the Bible though.  If he did, he'd know to use the Bible to understand the Bible.  Instead he is trying to synthesize the Bible into his own system.  We all try to do that kind of, though.  At the end of the day, the Bible doesn't need external supports, not really.  It's self contained--part of what is so astounding about it."

I'd be much more interested in hearing him defend his belief that life evolved from single celled organisms that arise from nothing, and that all species arose from mutations out of that original goo--rather than, literally,  ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.""  I'd be MUCH more interested in hearing him defend evolution.    Because the Bible is obviously a miracle, the more you consider and understand it, but evolution becomes increasingly absurd, the more you consider and scrutinize it.  I was converted to Christianity from a secular perspective. I had an easier time believing in the miracles of Jesus and Moses than I did believing in the Bible.  But the Bible is the real thing, and it's coherence and narrative is absolutely astounding, in light of the fact is was written by dozens of different hands over thousands of years (bc it's inspired and preserved according to God's promise)."

UghNoMJTurohwngCoAEC,Sawsan Al Bahar,1503284687601,"Dr.  Jordan, this reminds of the story of Myrrha, the mother of Adonis, in Ovid's Metamorphosis. Myrrha was transformed into a Myrrh tree after seducing and having intercourse with her father, and gave birth to Adonis, as a tree. I believe the tale has semitic roots as Adonis (Adoni - translates to 'My Lord') was the Phoenician God of Fertility and Vegetation.

The myth tells the story of Myrrha, who falls in love with her father, Cinyras, King of Cyprus, and tricks him into having sexual intercourse. After discovering her identity, Her father draws his sword and pursues her endlessly. She flees across Arabia and, after nine months, turns to the gods for help. They take pity on her and transform her into a myrrh tree. While in plant form, Myrrha gives birth to Adonis. According to the myth, the aromatic exudings of the myrrh tree are her tears.

Perhaps unrelated, but in Antiquity, the Myrrh tree is used to extract incense and resin and was considered quite precious. The latin word Myrrha translates to ""tree substance"" and interestingly enough, in its semitic form in Aramaic, Arabic, and Hebrew, (Mura, Mur, and Mor) it actually means ""bitter"". In Arabic it could even mean, ""She who is bitter"". 

It is interesting to consider the two stories of Myrrha and Lot thematically, and I am sure there's some literature linking them together in some sort of way.  It strikes me that even in Greek Myth, sexual deviation as extreme as incest and the pursuit of physical pleasure (at the beginning of the story, Myrrha suffers from her terrible desire in silence, and does not seek to consumate her love) is punishable with equally extreme consequences. Myrrha is also banished, and her sin is also penalised by exile, and as she is transformed into a tree she is also silenced.

Ovid opens the myth with a warning that this is a myth of great horror, especially to fathers and daughters:

        'The story I am going to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold themselves aloof, while I sing, or 
         if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or 
         else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.'"

So all this exercise tells me is that there is far more wisdom to be drawn by listening to intelligent individuals than whatever content may be in the Bible. And if that is true, why not dispense with the Bible all together.

While I agree that there are certain archetypal story lines that resonate with the human condition, I see no reason that the Bible would deserve being attributed any more interpretative richness than the Iliad by Homer. That at least would come without the dangers of dogmatic rigid belief generated consistently by a religious mindset."

For once the things said in this video sound almost completely like nonsensical tea leaf reading. Especially from the non peterson voices. The pepe video was really good and insightful, but here i hear people scrapping the bottom of the barrel in an attempt to make and project connections that don't seem to be there, or else are massively over analyzing. For example: somehow Abraham taking care of his guests with food and a bath equals reproductive and recreational sex and might be tied to the biblical flood? Wtf?

It's like a really bad fortune teller grasping at straws for a 'hit' with the audience along with really transparent cold reading:

""I'm sensing someones dead relative whose name starts with 'J', anyone? Or maybe a 'K'? No? An 'L' then? Anybody? No? Uhh.. I'm getting the feeling they liked sex for reproduction, except when they liked it for recreation. Obviously this describes someone very specific. Don't be shy. They have a message for you from beyond the grave!""

<Yawn> BOO! YOU SUCK! GET OFF THE STAGE!

NO WAIT! My grandma is dead, and she told me to secretly have lots and lots of sex while i was young for fun so I'd be good at it when it came time to financially trap a beta male provider via a great preview of sex before cutting him off from sex once married and having the mail mans kids instead while he's at work. Clearly she meant to say sex is both reproductive and recreational, and also to be used for manipulation and deception, just like Tamar in the Bible. That must be it. You are clearly a REAL psychic! Take all my money.

Errr.. no. Not buying it this time.

On the other hand, pretty telling that these days it's harder to come out as conservative than gay. That i totally buy. But instead of all this BS tarot reading, couldn't you just say that Sodom was seen as bad for being both rapists and gay, two things that each on their own would have been hated and reviled at the time the story was written, and even moreso put together? Regardless of current western standards, many cultures still today see homosexuals as no morally different from rapists, pedophilia, bestiality etc. For example China recently banned all these topics from mention in public news and entertainment i heard. I think occams razor applies here. But you guys are navel gazing for a message from the universe that is consistent with your own current world views and desired message, and you don't even know exactly what you want to say.

Especially the last 40 minutes or so is where i feel like things really start to come together and the arguements, and reasonings and how they make sense begins to align more clearly. With that said though i have one small nitpick that i feel the need to express somewhat begrudgingly as i do not like to get bogged down by all the details that we disagree on as it often distracts us from the much larger common ground that we share, but none the less i feel a desire to state perhaps the obvious as somewhere near the beginning of the video you talk about the notion that living under someone elses decisions/rules or principles is tyranny or slavery (i don't remember quite exactly which word was used) and while i agree with the sentiment of that notion, i think it's important not to take it too literally as it could then be used as justification for very disagreeable people not to conform in scenarios where it's normally expected (and pragmatic) for people to conform.

A concrete example would perhaps be the idea of being silent in a library. If someone is loud and is then told to tone down their voice, they could in theory, argue that comforming to this norm of being silent or quiet in a library would be them giving in to tyranny/slavery as they don't personally agree with that norm. 

Perhaps i'm being too skeptical or too pessimitic to immediatly assume that people would twist this arguement for personal motivations of varying degrees of validity, but since it wasn't mentioned or addressed in the video i thought it would be worthwhile to do so, even if the reasoning for not addressing it was that the concerns i've laid out above are fairly obvious and self evident and therefore not really worth arguing about as most people should be able to figure that out on their own."

UgggvazM2oxjwngCoAEC,Nic Hautamaki,1503284710750,"Jordan Peterson, I don't think that modern day sexuality is nearly a confused or confusing as you make it out to be. Modern sexual mores can be summed up in two simple clauses: anything sexual between consenting adults is permissible, but anything done to another without consent is wrong.
Now that isn't to say that that's a perfect system without flaws, but it isn't a very confusing one. The confusion, if there is any, is a consequence of people confusing what consent is or who has a right to grant it. For instance, conservative people seem to be under the impression that their consent is or should be required for other people that have nothing to with them to do sexual things to each other. And certain people seem to believe that dressing provacatively or acting in a certain way is broadcasting universal consent when really at most it is broadcasting a potential openness to a sexual encounter; but being potentially open to something if the right person comes along does not mean universally consenting to everyone to do anything that pops into their minds.
That shouldn't actually be confusing at all; even though it's certainly new and against previously existing norms, it's fairly basic and easy to explain."

In the NT, he takes on human skin in the being of Jesus.  God then dies on the cross.  The flesh is gone but his institution the church remains, and now the church is dying and the secular culture is carrying on his work with a success rate never seen before in history.  God has pour himself into a secular culture with Christian values, that`s carrying on his work while not believing in him.  God is now hidden, but his work is being done like never before.  God works in mysterious ways is not an understatement.

I like the Canadian Brothers Karamazov and Peterson needs to explore the reality of God; and not just that God is a convenient metaphor or abstraction for a father/king figure devised by a tribe of clever monkeys.

It was probably understood to be the same type of request that was later made by the citizens of Sodom to have relations with the angels. The story reveals the need for those that embrace sexual chaos to be continually fed with freshly deceived meat to fuel their own delusion. As far as how far you want to go with it commentating on our current sexual climate, Abraham not agreeing to any form of treaty or deal with the King proscribes the correct attitude for how we are to deal with those that are initiating or are just going along with the deception of sexuality for its own sake. His attitude allows him to be the one that is able to still receive a blessing which is the whole point of the passage as it is just after his conversation with Melchizedek. Aligning ourselves with those individuals, organizations, corporations, etc. that perpetuate the cannibalistic attitude to sexual innocence which is so prevalent all around us keeps us from our destiny of creating something new that lasts, I.E.

Ugh4xSgyjqCgnngCoAEC,JarrodDSchneider,1503284724800,"Some thoughts about JBP and academic postmodernism: 

As a student myself, initially I was excited by JBP's new plan to identify and avoid university classes that are mired in postmodern rhetoric.  Upon further reflection, however, there are a couple of things about this plan that I find to be at odds with the spirit of JBP's overall message.  Don't get me wrong, I am all for identifying classes that bear the influence of the more cultish aspects of postmodern thinking-so that students can make more informed decisions- but I think outright avoidance of such classes (esp. for those already aware of the potential dangers of such thinking) is perhaps a mistake. One of the great things that JBP's teachings have reinforced for me is just how important it is to expose oneself to opposing points of view.  He constantly reminds us that the proper way to navigate the pitfalls of ideological possession is to hold multiple arguments in one's head simultaneously, pit those arguments against one another, and in the process come to more balanced, considered conclusions. We can study postmodernism from a distance, we can indirectly engage with its ideas in books and online, but nothing beats setting up camp in the real trenches and directly engaging with those who are genuinely motivated by the postmodern-spirit.  However toxic one considers postmodernism to be, its ideas (as Stephen Hicks pointed out in 'Explaining Postmodernism') represent a genuine, intellectual and philosophical movement, and thus need to be confronted and engaged with as such. In essence, we must animate our inner postmodernist in order to fully understand and integrate it into a more balanced, wiser way of viewing and operating in the world.  As Eric Weinstein would likely put it, we must be able to set up camp in the postmodern room of our mind, but then be able to decamp and exit that room once we are done exploring it (for those that don't know, Eric is the brother of the Evergreen professor Bret Weinstein- Eric is pretty brilliant, check out his interview with Sam Harris in which he argues for a more nuanced, considered view of religion- in many ways his interview went a lot better than JBP's efforts with Harris in a similar vein.) The manifestation of postmodern philosophy is indicative an underlying collective-personality movement of the western psyche, one that emerged above the surface and into the light of conscious reality, and thus deserves to be engaged with and fully understood.  If we are to revivify the universities and reinstate the pursuit of truth over social justice, we must bravely confront these ideas- not boycott them. For someone that so forcefully stresses the stunting effects of Oedipal parenting, in this respect, JBP is behaving much like an overprotective parent seeking to shield his children (young students) from what he perceives to be the risky, chaotic and harmful ideas of the world (academic postmodernism).

 Last semester, I took a class steeped in social justice dogma called 'Cross-cultural Communications'. Granted, it was quite disgraceful that the class-content provided zero counter-arguments to the information it provided, yet it was my very attempts to seek out contrary points of view that led me to JBP in the first place. IMO I emerged on the other side of that class much stronger as a result, as I was now versed in multiple points of view.  Though nearly all the SJW-esque ideas crumbled under further scrutiny (that is, the modicum of truth they may have contained was grossly overshadowed by the dogmatic, ideological simplicity of only viewing the world through that limited lens), nevertheless I am grateful that I now better understand the mindset of some of those (esp. my postmodernist professor) who hold such ideas. One of the insights I gained from real-life interaction with ideologically possessed leftists, for instance, is just how similar they are to the more extreme personalities on the right.  I learned that both extreme ends of the political spectrum have a tendency to selectively focus upon those societal trends that move in opposition to their own political values; this allows each side to construct a societal narrative that frames their own side as heroic and the opposing side as villainous- this in turn reinforces and justifies their own hardline political commitments.  Though this insight is by no means groundbreaking or highly original, the fact that it was informed by direct experiential contact concretizes it as a life lesson, making it all the more unlikely for the experiencer (me) to fall into the same trap. 

Another thing about this that I think needs deeper scrutiny is the fact the potential benefits or harm of a class cannot exclusively be determined by the contents of its official language. The written language associated with a particular class is not wholly representative of the ideas it seeks to communicate. Imagine, for instance, a class that officially engages with postmodern ideas yet wherein the professor clearly communicates that such ideas are not to be adopted wholesale by the students but rather, they are merely meant to entertain postmodern philosophy as an exploratory exercise. Though such an approach is likely the exception and not the rule, it's easy to see how such a class could be falsely blacklisted.  There has to be some professors out there interested in examining postmodernism and its products as a philosophical phenomenon, and I'd hate to see their efforts accidentally diverted by this plan. 

Also, Peterson himself has warned on several occasions that anytime a tool is invented, that same tool can easily be used for different and/or opposing aims. The same type of program could also be used to identify classes that value modernist enlightenment principles and the like. The potentiality that this could serve as a kind of Pandora's box for further polarization is something we should also keep in mind."

He will give us however much detail He knows we need, and from there we must live by the light of faith.

Seemed sort of down hill from there. I guess nobody said this stuff is easy. Edit: nice points around 1:11:00 regarding sexuality."

UggFb0qf5N6gY3gCoAEC,Joe Foster,1503284728631,"Radicle interpretation of Abrahams Story, how about it being actually True and Prophetic? Instead of symbolic
Reasons is, Majority of people on Earth and almost all Nations view Abraham as their religious father, all Jews, Christians and Muslims (as God promised), Ishmael according to Islamic tradition became the father of Muslims as he settled in Arabia, God warned Abraham that Ishmael will fight his legitimate sons, Just look at what's going on with Jews / Muslims and Christians / Muslims relationship throughout the centuries and today, Jihad is an old Ishmaelite tradition you can say.

When you look at it from that prospective, Story of Abraham is real and actually prophetic, and we can see fulfillment of those prophecies from out point in time."

UgjmsXXU4sYWGHgCoAEC,Amisi Kiarie,1503284734602,"I disagree profoundly with the suggestion that Abraham's refusal of gifts from the King of Sodom is minor. The idea you have to understand when interpreting these stories is that the central theme is the LORD's hand in the establishment of Israel (cf. Ps 44). It's not the purity of Abraham's achievements that is at stake, but the degree to which God is responsible --- and therefore to be glorified, for Abraham's wealth."

UgguzyrtQFsgwXgCoAEC,Buster Thursday,1503284734634,"This gets a bit beyond Abraham here, but as I was listening to the discussion about lying in the wilderness, in the exile, it reminded me of something I noticed about Genesis a while back.   Adam was willing to throw Eve under the bus, so to speak, perhaps attempting to spare himself judgement.  Noah wasn't willing to take responsibility for his own drunkenness (small wonder--talk about survivor's guilt!), and Abraham--to save HIMSELF (not Sarah), claimed Sarah was only his sister.   Isaac did the same.  Jacob sent his family across the river first, fearful that Esau might attack him--he was using his family to test the waters.   Reuben offered his children to be sacrificed/slain/enslaved if any harm came to Benjamin on the trip down to Egypt.  And then there's Judah.  He's the first character in Genesis to offer himself--his own life, if things go wrong."
Ugj2W-sSgc5wRngCoAEC,Лк шквћ,1503284734640,"To Jordan: On the 6th minute you asked how God is less spoken about as the Bible progresses(I didn't yet watch rest of the conversation). Jung talked about this in the ""The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.9 Part 1)"". I recommend you read about his study of the tribal people and how they didn't differentiate between subjective and objective how everything was magic(mana). So the Bible is the record of evolution of human thought from everything is magic to the view we have today. Although I'm probably repeating something you already know."
