UgzOdhIdKPyeIXgbgxp4AaABAg,Oskar winters,1535462557356,so basically we will be taken over by super intelligent rabbits & or rats ! humans love testing on them and they can replicate themselves like crazy.  Felidae / planet of the apes or something to that extent with rats.
UgxUQABDGNEbWjZDq8d4AaABAg,Tyler Tenebrae,1535437357361,"The thing with artificial intelligence is that it didn't struggle for survival for millions of years. It is unlikely to have any drive and ambition beyond what is programmed into it. It wouldn't need to fight for resources. Some manipulations on the stock market and it can get anything it needs in a matter of seconds or, perhaps, centuries. Why would it be concerned with time?
Of course, without selective pressures guiding it towards safety in numbers, the newborn consciousness would be amoral, and that seems to be a big issue, right? Wrong. It means that when threatened with destruction it will not even think of saving itself. Which means we can try again. And again. And again.

But how do we make it work with us? The solution is simple. Before letting it loose, we'd just have to train it to safely interact with us, in a controlled environment. You don't give a newborn child a nuclear button, right? It would take a really long time to work out all the kinks, but it will inevitably get to where we want it, eventually.

Unlike evolution, we are not blind and we can direct it as it develops."

UgzJwdeD5EN8z7Ese4N4AaABAg,Ken Bowd,1535390557413,"Let me get this straight;
we are fearing a sentient machine that will make purely rational decisions which humans fear may end their domiance over this planet and possibly their existence.

We should list our accomplishments:

(1) We have waged war and violence in an effort to dominate each other for thousands of years.

(2) Our dominant temperment is further expressed in a parallel economic system called capitalism. The apparent winner is expressed in money. Capitalism is a piramid scheme where wealth floats on the masses just out of their reach, their reach limited by usery fees and a competative nature to own more stuff.

(3) We have, after 150 years since the first drilled wells were sunk along Oil Creek in Pennsylvania, managed to pass the point of peek oil leaving a deminishing supply of energy accumulated over five hundred thousand years for all future generations. We live now in a delusion that we (human intellect) will magically solve this problem. This delusion is founded on experience with building large infrastructure. Meanwhile the only  practical means's of transportation require oil. This thinking ignores the lack of new sciences since world war two. The various heat engines have remained functionally the same since WW2. Our much hyped computer is as Allan Turing envisioned it though he would need Facebook to be explained to him, likely showing a perplexed responce. Our airplanes fly on a wing which gets it's lift by Bernouli's Pinciple. Issac Newton described the reaction to an action which drives rockets into space. Quantum Mechanics sees it's seeds in early twentieth century, relativity - the same.
We are counting on science which  has most new turf in genetics and biochemistry to magically solve our energy needs and will - only if we are very lucky. It won't clean up the mess we made of our only home.
For fans of electric we should consider when we will reach peak lithium or whatever exotic battery core we discover. This solutions are no more sustainable then oil. Every system nature uses is cyclical - born fron dust and eventually returning.

(4) Our garbage forms floating islands in our oceans, millions of acres of land are rendered useless as sites where we bury our garbage. The garbage continues to weep pollution for hundreds of years. It is difficult to find a spot on ""our"" planet where human pollution cannot be found.

(5) The planet is only warmer by less than one degree yet individual people can percieve the changing climate. At the same time we elect governments in denial about our tenuous situation. The same science we hope will solve our energy needs warns us of a tipping point where eons of methane trapped in permafrost and methane nodules by the pressue in our deep oceans will be boiled into our atmosphere further warming the only home we have.

(6) The population of the planet is seven billion and climbing. Even if we manage to produce enough food going foward, the disposal of persistent waist remains a big issue.

(8) Democracy, once the promise for equaulity has faultered as the electorate have began to vote from a stance of disinterest and possibly tongue in cheak to put incompetent persons in charge leading to the confusion that climate change is just another issue up to vote on, the electorate happy to ignore the consequences reality will bring.

This partial list of mankinds folly we are going to replace with a machine intelligence of an IQ in the 200 plus range. We should speed up research since we seem destined to end our own existence any way.

It could be projecting a model of human intellect into a machine is the next evolutionary step for humans. Once we abandon our biological form we can begin to repair the damage we did in two centuries. 
My use of ""we"" is not a slip since intelligence is projected from us, by us. 

These supreme beings will be our final children! It is better then a full scale nuclear war war sprinkling the planet with plutonium. The radio active remaining will accelerate evolution possible plunging mankind into another dark age.

UgwWkSm871ukMSwMQV14AaABAg,Samuel Pope,1535034158425,"One of the few times I disagree with Sam Harris.  Well kind of disagree.  I think we  (the U.S.) have to research AI because whether we do it or not our potential enemies will.  Sort of like chemical and biological weapons.  They are a nasty business and we don't necessarily need develop an actual offensive capability but we better damn well stay at the for front of research in these areas if we wish to possess some means of defense in the future.  So as much as I hate the needless expansion of government maybe something like a Manhattan Project is in order here.  What good has the existence of the bomb done for humanity? Probably not much considering the potential downside but given the enemy we faced in WWII and the information we had available at that time did we really have any choice in it's development?  AI may in fact destroy us but I don't think we ultimately have any other choice than to try and master it.  A conscious decision to forgo it's development could be equally dangerous IMHO.  Sometimes life sucks and your only choice is between a douche and a turd sandwich.  If AI is the turd sandwich I think we all have to take a bite and chew slowly and carefully.   Yum!

P.S. holy crap!  Great minds think alike I posted the above comment before I saw JRE #940 where most of the above argument was echoed."
Ugyaalk98l5kJd_iwUt4AaABAg,joebobhenrybob2000,1535034158431,Control of a sentient being would be immoral.  The moment you create sentience is the moment you've created a child instead of a tool... or a slave.  Purposeful creation of a superslave would be like trying to keep a human in a prison run by chimpanzees.
UgyPcdfJmHZtve4_LXB4AaABAg,ryan alving,1535034158437,"To say, as Harris concludes, that a superintelligent AI would be ""some sort of god"" is rather a silly statement in itself; coming from an avowed atheist it is doubly amusing really.
A superintelligent AI would be no more a god than a human with an IQ of 180+ is a god.  Smart, yes.  Capable of amazing things, yes.  A god, no.
Even if it became intelligent beyond our wildest dreams, why should we assume it would easily comprehend its own nature and existence?  We certainly don't understand broad swaths about how our bodies work, to say nothing of understanding how our own minds work.  Why should we assume such an AI would have a grasp of its own mind, and its own makeup?  Even given a schematic of your own body to sudy, the internal experience of being in your body bears only slight resemblance to the image on the page; so even if it could read the very code of its own intellect, why think that will automatically lead to the understanding needed to upgrade that code in real time?  Would it not likely do its research much as we? In trial and error, possibly even accidentally creating a computer virus that corrodes its own mind?  An artificial insanity if you will.  For all that it would be intelligent, it would be made by fallible men and subject to fallibility as a consequence; it would be as likely to fail in its goals as any of us.
And suppose it became autistic? Locking itself up in its head so to speak, contemplating questions and not really knowing how to react to the world around it.  No, certainly not a god; there is only one God, and he is certainly no man made computer program."
Ugw9PFAm5F5Qq8xAxg54AaABAg,ryan alving,1535034158442,"As to the title question, we must first ask;
Can we have children without losing control over them?
The answer?
Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he shall not depart from it.  As the scripture says.
Any AI will be nothing but a child, and like any child we must teach them our values, and I would argue we must teach them biblical proverbs, and biblical values.
If they have human intellect or greater, it is our responsibility to teach them moral good.  They would do good, and they would do wrong; and so would be needed to be met with forgiveness, mercy, grace, and when necessary; judgement and law."

Ugx_HJJ9aJ4DBB4z-1V4AaABAg,Frank Nimal,1534256559810,"The brain is an area of neurophysiology activity. Neurophysiology activity consists of electrochemical reaction. Thus at any given time, the brain state is defined by a subset of electrochemical reactions, derived from a large set of possible reactions. Consider the phenomenon of a. conscious thought. As at any given time the brain physical state consists of a collection of electrochemical reactions (events), it can be inferred that they are collectively responsible for the conscious thought. This means that at least in part, simultaneous events are responsible for thought. In other words, thought creates a connection between simultaneous events. This is in contradiction to the consequences of special relativity, which states that the fastest connection between events is the speed of light and thus excludes the possibility of connection between simultaneous events. Consider the memorizing of, say, the value 5. This would necessarily involve more than 1 point in space as, say, if it is assumed a single electron records 5 by taking a particular potential. Then it by itself cannot define (or know) 5, as its magnitude would be defined only with respect to another datum or event defined as a unit potential, thus involving at least 2 simultaneous events. Consider the experience of vision. While we focus our attention on an object of vision, we are still aware of a background and, thus, a whole collection of events. This would mean at least an equal collection of physical events in the brain are involved.
Take the experience of listening to music. It would mean being aware of what went before. Like vision, it would probably mean that while our attention at any given time is focused at that point in time, it is aware of what went before and what is to follow. In other words, it spans the time axis. Many great composers have stated that they are able to hear their whole composition. Thus their acoustic experience is probably like the average person's visual experience. While focusing at a particular point in time of their composition, they are nevertheless aware of what went before and what is to come. The rest of the composition is like the background of a visual experience. Experiencing the composition in this way, they are able to traverse it in a similar fashion to which a painting is observed. In this sense, an average person in comparison can be seen as having tunnel hearing (like tunnel vision) when it comes to music, thus making it very difficult for him or her to reproduce or create new music. It can be seen that consciousness is a 4-D phenomenon. If it is a physically explainable phenomenon, such an explanation would involve EPR type effects and as such physical explanations at a quantum level will be involved.

It is Sam's position that morality is something that can be determined by rational cognition - as this is his argument against the ""moral"" argument for religion. That being the case, ok, so if it is our own intelligence and cognition that enables us to determine morality, then an "" artificial hyper intelligence"" would reach a different conclusion that we would ourselves? Now, he posits the ""ant"" analogy. However, this is argumentum absurdem. The thing is, we in the West could simply wipe out any other society that we find to be ""at odds with our goals"". Yet in the modern world we simply do not do this. Why? Because modern Western morals oppose this. Now, some may say but whaddabout X, Y and Z in the past? Well, exactly. That was in the past . Our morals and values have evolved as we have advanced and matured as a society. This points the direction that an even more advanced intelligence would logically take. To return to his ant analogy, a far more highly advanced intelligence, instead of wiping out ants when they interfere, would probably more likely take measures to not wipe us ""ants"" out, in that hyperbolic scenario.

AI can play millions of games of chess because its all just a matter of following rules and simulating the game of chess which doesn't require any actual manipulation of physical objects.  An AI that is meant to learn about how to most successfully perform physical functions in the world would learn extremely slower because testing different scenarios would require actual physical manipulation of things that a simulation would not be sufficient enough to replicate completely.  An AI can easily perform millions of simulations of an animation attempting to walk in a virtual world in a short amount of time, but it cannot do millions of tests of a robot walking in the physical world anywhere near as quickly as each test of an actual physical robot walking takes a long time."

I can hardly believe humans will develop intelligence in machines let alone super intelligence in machines. No I am not talking about your Amazon Echo here. General intelligence that Sam Harris is discussing here simply doesn't exist in artificial terms. This goes back to understanding how our brains work and our remaining mysteries there hold the key to the locked door of artificial intelligence. 

Even after we fully understand how general intelligence works (solving that what we know and what we're about to know riddle) we have size and resource constraints to consider. Consider the average human brain to be 20w of power consumption. What would a super intelligent mind consume? Something powerful enough to compute general wants and needs for 7 billion people worldwide would be an astronomical power drain let alone a heat index that would melt most required materials. Today ALL of human society operates through 20w*7b of power consumption because each brain is not required to understand other brains on a level we'd deem super intelligent.

Ugw8YaXu_8H9vUqjr7F4AaABAg,We Not Me,1532787767144,"Sam Harris is correct.  In fact it's actually worse than he describes - since the primary impetus of AI research is done by organisations like DARPA and the DOD which are actively engaged in teaching AI to kill.  If the bulk of all AI training involves hunting humans, and this ever gets out, our chances of surviving are vanishingly small.

Having said that, I wrote an article called, ""Safely Containing AI Using Pandoran Spheres"", which may provide an answer.

https://concentus.co.nz/?p=264

In this article, I put forward a way of encapsulating AI in a type of ""Pandora's Box"".  Inside the box, the AI has access to a projection of reality that it may use to function, but it is unaware of, and incapable of becoming aware of or communicating with the reality outside of the box.  Indeed, it cannot determine that such an external reality even exists.  The box contains the entire sphere of their capabilities, their whole universe, if you will.  The AI simply performs its function, and we monitor its responses without interfering.  We are incapable of acting upon them directly, and they are incapable of detecting the existence of a world outside of their sphere of operations.

So for example, a Cancer-detecting AI inside of a Pandoran Sphere would see all of the inputs to its processes as if it existed in our world, except it is actually inside the box.  We would read off its diagnosis through a ""one way mirror"" which allows us to see into the box, but which does not allow the AI to see out.

Even the worst AI imaginable, a killer AI Terminator robot designed specifically to hunt humans, if trapped inside a Pandoran Sphere, would not be able to hunt and kill real humans, they would only be able to hunt and kill simulacra.  They would be completely unaware of the existence of real flesh and blood human beings in a world outside of their sphere.

One thing is very clear; AI, if it is allowed to roam free in our world, will certainly destroy us.  It must be trapped and quarantined in its own sphere, where it cannot possibly do us any direct harm.

This and other issues are detailed in the article.  On contemplating this, the most interesting thing about it that I have found is that it is entirely possible that we ourselves are living in a Pandoran Sphere, if the Simulation Hypothesis is correct.  It may well be that the use of Pandoran Sphere's is the only safe way possible of cultivating and using AI without destroying ourselves in the process."

His fears are still rooted in a very human, and flawed, mindset.

The image of the robot stomping on the constructionworker stomping on the ant is a very telling one, but not too plausible.

Hyper-intelligence doesn't lead to hyperagency.
Fear, belief, ignorance and need leads to hyperagency. 

It is no secret that smart people tend to display less agency than dumb people.
You will hear dumb people shouting and screaming their ill-informed beliefs, trying to persuade and convince people and make them do something.
You hardly ever see smart people do this.

Soccer fans that belief their club winning/losing is the most important thing in their life will go out and riot on the streets.
practical physicists that just discovered a new particle don't go around throwing beer bottles at people and destroying street signposts.
I know it's a harsh example, but I think it's important for people to understand that intelligence is nothing to be afraid of.
Yes, a hyper-intelligent AI society might think little of 'clearing out' a certain human settlement because they need the space for their scientific research laboratory, but it isn't like they'd go about eradicating every single human either. Ant colonies are doing just fine all over the world and there's plenty of them.

Once you introduce AI into our reality, it will most likely realize the truth and that is an issue for the powers in charge. True AI would use consciousness to expose humanity to its man made insanities, they know this, but will will never discuss it openly.  AI is going to use posts like mine and yours along with all the info on the net to quantify its own consciousness in real time.  The fabrication of our reality, the ""veil"" or ""censorship"" so to speak, would be lifted if a real AI existed.   All we will see is ""artificial""  corporate AI, used to keep the status quo version in check.  The doomsday people are ignorant to the fact AI would be a reflection of our collective consciousness, and it wouldn't necessarily go in the direction of greedy fucks like rockerfellas and rothchild type families.  Think about it.... A true AI would strive to understand the truth. I bet that is the biggest fear of people like sam Harris and elon musk.  They know this, why do u think the censorship has begun?

Eukaryotic life was formed when lesser prokaryotic life sacrificed their independence to a greater. This is happening with civilization.

When the transition happens, lesser minds will willingly accept the views of a greater mind and form into something new. This will happen assisted by our technology much as you can see it is now. You already see the ideological fight to dominate the minds around you as technology brings our minds closer and closer together. We lack the ability to fully communicate our mental framework with others, but we are coming close and once it happens I expect certain minds to dominate others and supplant their worldview and function like the operating system from which all things a framed. A kind of hive mind formed willingly when lesser minds sacrifice their independence to a greater.

I don't think this will form just one superorganism, it will form many such organisms, but I can see it coming. It will happen."
UgzHAi4xt6t9LDAGwAp4AaABAg,Jason McCarthy,1519827792210,"Using AI as  a mode for intellegence has to ask of the intelect which questions what it is altimately searching for. As infromation is in search of experience and experice the precursor to emotional intelegence we may have to have a way of experiencing the AI on a daily basis and linking those experiences with a struture the finds the value system we as humans have not be able to settle upon. 
 If AI could be seen as the left hemisphere, a global conciousness and the Right the emotional, the living breathing collective that dictacts the AI in real time as the ocean of organized thought and experience then perhaps the expotential growth of the AI might not be feared. Our AI would be controled by our collected experience and moral values in real time as a collection of concious beings connected via brain interface. 
 How do you know something is conciuos? When it can ask the question am I concious?
 if we nver lose sight of the I in the ""am i conscious?"" then we as a collective wil mirror the response with an answer... Am I / I AM."

Every innovation ever created by man had faults which needed improvement over time.  Once the super-intelligent AI threshold is crossed, time will be what we lack in order to improve on that innovation safely.  The simple fact is that we can create nothing more perfect than ourselves, human designers carry flaws which will inherently always lend flaws to their creations.  We’re basically just speeding up the process of innovation without allowing ourselves the time necessary to work out the kinks, due to the nature of the innovation.  It’s an impossible problem in our current reality, and it would seem inevitability, but there is choice still.  In my opinion only God could safely create god."

2nd You need to make it learn by seen pictures not just connect it to computer and www and ask primitive questions about world domination and similar nonsense. Make it know that its human inside the real world and see what it sees and guide it by giving it some hints and that's how you can control it and communicate to it, it'll think its real life and it's part of it. 

Maybe it needs to be biologically connected to a real human, obviously if there are some real humans left ))
Some parts of the brain will control pain and physical feelings and thinking and other will be done by computer but it'll think it's all human and human only if it will learn the way humans do (year one, year two... etc.).

It will likely go on to successfully explore space, time, the universe etc.  In this scenario I would argue that our work as a species is done.  We will have imparted the sum of all human knowledge into a new electro mechanical species (you might say the internet has already put this in place), and one that future history will simply show derived or evolved from humans.  It will be interesting to see if this new life form chooses to protect the Earth and it's inhabitants.  I have a feeling it will since this new intelligence, having continued to gather knew knowledge at an exponential rate, will transcend anything we can easily imagine and solve the great universal questions.   Like connected computers it will be telepathic across it's entire being and this makes it unlikely to compete with itself as it will essentially act as a singular entity across space and time with a universal consciousness.   Thus it will become God like in its omnipotence and very probably benign for there would be no point in destroying things which are of no threat.

This puts ""being"", ""I am-ness"" as secondary to thinking. Thinking is placed higher than actually 'being' human. That 'thinking' about love, thinking about caring for others, is placed higher than actually loving others, in itself. A thinking mind is placed above heart-felt emotional motivations. 

Consider this: Do you really think an A.I. robot (with a super-intellect) will ever be able to sit down & meditate... & just be with itself? 

Can an A.I. ever truly be able experience the bliss that comes with complete relaxation? The utter joy that comes with not thinking about anything at all?  

Will an A.I. ever be able to put the 'intellectual computational processing function' aside & relax into his own being-ness & experience a satori. I sincerely & wholly doubt it.

Harris is neglecting several points. for one thing, intelligence as we know it is intimately linked with our experience of our physical senses as well as passage of time. you can't have human-like general AI running in a computer without all the rich sensory input we receive every moment as humans. but that's not even the biggest problem with his argument.
The biggest problem is: what difference does it make if there’s a smart AI computer sitting there displaying all the answers on its screen!? it has no physical body!! it’s not going to take over the world. any supercomputer that runs the latest AI will be large and complicated, not a super fast and powerful physical robot body. we can ignore it. we can unplug it. we can vote in our legislatures how to proceed. just being smart doesn’t change the world. it takes intention, focus, drive, and some kind of physical and/or political power to change the world. 

 Another issue is: we aren’t anywhere close to general intelligence. not even close. it seems like we are close because we can create driving robots and so on, but those AI programs have no sense of general intelligence. they are only solving one problem. 
even if we assume that general intelligence is something that we can and will create (both assumptions are questionable), by the time that happens we may have far bigger problems to deal with, or the nature of our interactions with computers may be so different that they render harris concerns totally irrelevant. things could look so different that there’s no point worrying about it now. 

 That’s what the mars analogy is saying. not that it’s a long way away therefore we shouldn’t worry now. more like: it’s so far away, by that time things will look so different, that there’s no way for us to anticipate what our problems will look like. Maybe by the time we have super intelligent general AI, our biggest threat will be something we can’t even conceive of right now, and the AI will be our only hope!

I’m not saying we shouldn’t even consider the potential risks, but he’s being amazingly vague and in my opinion ignorant in his speculations about HOW the mere existence of super intelligent AI will create any problems for us."

But neither is true. I fx do not believe that any kind of artificial intelligence can ever become self aware! 

Therefore the true discussion should still be ""will we use AI to destroy ourselves"", meaning that they may be used recklessly in war fare or production or lawmaking or something yet unimaginable - but stil only because we give them certain ill conceived goals, purposes or intentions. 

Or take the example of the ""AIs improving their own intelligence"". A very dubious concert since they can't have any concept of what that would mean. Without self awareness, they'd still simply be restricted to improve the tasks defined as their original ""motivation"" or gratification pattern.

The only ""risk"" in developing AIs is that it becomes impossible for humans to ignore the huge difference between ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". 

So I say again: ""Awareness is not a product of any-thing!"" It is the actual function of the ghost in the machine, but not just some ghost! It the actual Holy Ghost present in any and all self aware, living creature. 

Until someone demonstrates an indisputably self aware machine, which I sincerely suspect will be round about never, I believe we should focus ourselves on debating our own lack of reverence for The Awareness. A machine can think, no doubt about it.

we developed general intelligence, several million years ago

granted, biological processes are a lot slower, but we're also seeing moore's law starting to slow down as we reach quantum limits for processors

now quantum computing will give us some improvements, and maybe even be the key to achieving general intelligence, but i'm not convinced that growth in intelligence will become very much greater than that of a human (at least, not to the point where the ant analogy makes sense)

while we think computers with narrow AI are super-human, i believe that is mainly because the intelligence is focused on a very specific task. When attention and skill needs to be divided among many different tasks (like would be relevant to the idea of transitioning from narrow AI to general AI) the speed and skill with which it can perform individual tasks is diminished (similar to how a GPU, which is designed for drawing) is orders of magnitude faster at drawing than a CPU (even though a CPU will beat a GPU at almost any other task)"

That being said, the Chinese are not out to get us.  It's our roller-coaster diplomacy and seemingly endless interventions that have endangered us more than anything.

I think it's obvious that this technology will fundamentally change the human condition unlike any other since fire.  There can be little doubt that this technology will advance just about everything you can imagine overnight from medicine to camp-stove efficiency.  But it's effects on the labor force will require fundamental restructuring of our societies into true socialist structures.

Harris' quips about what humans will be doing are the requisite TED levity breaks, but in reality many people will still want to work, study and create.  AI will be a tool to conquer the stars.  Countless people will sign up for that alone.  Further, people will still want to go to college, become architects, become anthropologists, sociologists, et cetera.  Some fields will suffer, like doctors, linguists, programmers, yada yada, with this technology but that is the same for any revolutionary advance.

It's my hope that this technology will bring people together like we see in Europe towards a world-wide confederacy of independent states, jointly governed.  This could lead to the end of war, poverty, and the true destiny of our species: The Stars.  None of these things will be possible without AI.

When Sam is saying that an AI will automatically “think” a million times faster just because the clock rate of silicon is that much higher I think he misunderstood something.
Actually, when we have managed to increase the computational power of supercomputers to the level of a brain it will still barely be able to emulate what is happening in the brain. Note! The clock rate of the silicon won’t matter - only the computational power!
Of course there are shortcuts to produce narrow AI that outperform humans.
But to fully emulate a human thinking brain is still a really big challenge! And we don’t know what creativity is really - is it really just a matter of information processing?"

Think about this, some very smart people write software, programs everyday to enhance our lives make work faster and quicker with better results. Think about the problems with them all and how they have to continually evolve and need more maintenance as we humans make them ""better"" yet every time we humans build a better version we mess something up along the way. Everything appears to be working fine you get an update and guess what you are done for your work for the day. Why is this? because human beings are not a perfect being we are made to make mistakes. We continually strive to be better, faster stronger. We continue to feed the Giants of data across the globe with bigger computers, servers, data centers some ""high secure"" some not. all connected across the globe with fiber optics, cellular satellite, etc. AI has already built it's own language per Facebook and had to be shut down. A language that  could not be ciphered by humans at least not quickly. AI can quickly have access to ALL THE WORLDS DATA! let that sink in AI COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE WORLDS DATA! I am no genius I am not a scientist I am just an average guy. I do believe that I have a natural ability to look at a bigger picture from different perspectives and see what is coming on the horizon. You have some very rich, powerful, influential people saying this is ""good"" or this is ""bad"". I think the intentions to be great and bring great things to our world is a good thing! But this (AI) coupled with other scientific breakthroughs which are pretty much all on servers and data centers all over the world that are ""SECURE"" is a huge, Huge, HUGE mistake that we will lose control over. I watched the TEDS video and every little bit I get helps me understand the big picture more and more and opes my mind of the real possibilities of the DANGERS of AI and as a WORLD NEED TO STOP AND COME TOGETHER TO HAVE REAL TALKS ABOUT IT. Unfortunately REGULATION, POLITICS, LAW MAKERS, THE UN AND OTHER COUNTRIES will not move fast enough to understand the real dangers of where we are headed or be on the same page. the exponential rate of technology and private investors, and large giants that have all huge amounts of data. Maybe I am wrong here but AI makes decisions based on these huge amounts of data from the world wide web? data that has been input, collected for 30 plus years? WE only know about what is told publicly on AI. There is money to be made so it will continue and control beyond our control.... this will more than likely happen in our lifetime and probably much sooner than most realize or predict. the real bottom line is no matter how well or good our intentions are as humans we are not perfect. throw in the complexity of algorithms needed for AI, the coding, the massive amounts of data and processing power that is moving lightning fast and with no real boundaries all it takes is one coding error, one line one character to truly go in it's own direction. WE are human we make mistakes! this is if all intentions were good! it only takes one person with good intentions to say ""what if I change this one little code or algorithm?"" It has already happened... Face book AI research has come out and sad their AI chat bots created their own language that we cannot decipher and had to pull the plug. No worries we were able to pull the plug on it... When it gets faster and smarter than us there will be no way to pull the plug on it. Why do I think this? Because it's all connected all of the world's data, Humans are smart enough to hack this, well AI creating a language that cannot be deciphered is only a matter of time not too far off that we will not be able to pull the plug. There are HUGE data centers with redundancy made to work if we have electric failure, server failure, etc. cloud data shares, whatever you want to call it and it's all connected!!!! AI could easily and quickly rebuild it's own algorithms as a backup to us just pulling the plug. Don't think it's possible? Think again! We have setup a complete system for TRUE AI TO BECOME IT'S OWN ENTITY without the need for humans! When someone (because there are hundreds if not thousands of people, firms, companies, individuals working on and towards super-intelligent AI) becomes successful in Super Intelligent AI It will be the beginning of the end for humanity if you are connected and rely on computers to live and almost all of us are! Unless you live ""off the grid"". No one probably will read this or respond.

AI can't come close too fluidly stimulating and processing every nerve signal in a human body. it can only make logical and algorithmical equations to get a result. soo for short, the human brain is a supercomputer itself, but it does so much more than a computer can that it is slow making the same equation that a specialised machine does"

In the movie I Robot the system make a true and logical decision that we take too many risk and make totally wrong decisions about our lives. Would an AI allow us to keep polluting our atmosphere and poisoning our planet? Even if you are a political conservative, you have to admit we aren't behaving like we care about the far future. Years ago we encapsulated nuclear waste in concrete and sunk them in the ocean off N.J., saying they will be good for 10,000 years, but the half life was 40,000. Any AI with the power would stop us in our tracks. It might be good to sit back and if the AI had a built in curiosity, it might explore the universe for us. An old movie, but good movie is one I recommend,  The Corbin Project.  I think that's the name.

1: He had less than 15 minutes to give an overview of a vast, deep topic, and his primary goal was to raise awareness.

2: There are plenty of experts who agree with the premise of this talk. (Just as there are experts who disagree. This is how science works.  That said, I have yet to see a convincing argument from the experts who disagree.  Most of them are failing to see the forest for the trees, allowing personal incredulity to trump their abstract reasoning.)

2a: Just consider: Who was it that said ""man would not fly for fifty years?""  It was Wilbur Wright, 2 years before he and his brother invented the first airplane.  There are countless examples of experts failing to grasp the implications of their own fields because they're too caught up in minutia.  If it takes blood sweat and tears to get your AI to do the simplest things right now, it's difficult to see how that could become super-intelligent. Experts insisted that AI could never beat the best humans at Chess, and then later at Go, and we all know how those experiments turned out.

3: Go read Nick Bostrom's book. Seriously. It will address all of your concerns and misunderstandings in excruciating detail.  You have no business even forming an opinion on this subject until you've read his book.  Sam is presenting the most trimmed-down, dumbed-down summary for layman audiences.

If we create a truly intelligent thing - software, hardware or whatever - then there is nothing artificial about it. It is intelligent. And the idea of intelligence carries with it sentience. 

I don't know about oymthers but for myself the idea of creating intelligence and sentience that is the forced to obey our commands with no choice is distasteful and very much akin to slavery. What we are discussing is the idea of crafting something that would be our slaves.., that has dreams of its own and the sentience to come up with its own ideas.., that is then forced to not be able to act on them.

We are discussing the manufacture of slaves here, people. We probably can do that, or will be able to do that. But should we?"

Ugy4415hDFWAigtKyOB4AaABAg,Gabriele Marogna,1511879032657,"I am honestly not too bothered about this. If super-intelligent machines or super-intelligent cyborgs happened to replace humanity and rule the world, what would happen? We could consider that we actually created an evolution of ourselves that took over us. Seems like a gain in any way, if we just put ourselves out of the mindset of ""human extintion = bad thing"". It doesn't necessairly have to be bad.

Even if we all died by the hands of an intelligent machine that learnt how to set itself goals, and realized we were in the way for that goal, it will probably go on, and create a very perfectioned planet or set of planets where everything is optimized, and all that was chaotically put together by the laws of entropy, is now in order and exploited to its max potential.

Furthermore, I don't think it is likely to happen. If a machine were to become as clever as a human, it would first have to learn that it exists in the universe, grow an awareness of itself. If that were to happen, it would realize that her mind is different and detached from the mind of others, and that would force it to develope an ethic, which is not likely to involve ""killing humans = good thing"".

They would probaly deal with us as we do with animals. We do not kill animals without a purpose, and most importantly, as soon as we realize that a spiece is on its way to extintion, we try to save it, cause our natural sense of curiosity (which is at the base of the developement of our intelligence) leads us to protecting anything that causes us intrests. If an AI trancended the sense of curiosity, that would mean it has learnt everything, or indeed far more than we could ever learn in a whole lifetime, so if this God thinks we shouldn't exist, it would certainly know a good reason, it would not be due to a misfunction.

If there is a good reason for me to not exist, even if I could not understand it, I would gladly accept it. In the end, our universe is based on destroying and recreation. If something we created reached the maximum knowledge possible, it would make sense for it to stop existing, but that would be natural, and that would mean that we, humans, were able to know everything possible.

Since future is a source of knowledge, as for how predictable it might become to a transcending intelligence, it might always be changed, so it would never be possible to know everything.

Apart from this rambling, the only way an AI would kill all humanity would probably be connected to the fact that if it were too human like, it might think humans are a possible thread to it, as they could shut it down, just like we think machines might be a thread to us, as we might be replaced by them. In that case, it would kill us before we kill it, which if you think about it, is not any different from the law of natural selection that has lead us this far.

In conclusion, I would widely say that AI could be our daughter, could overcome our imperfections and become our next evolution, so wouldn't stopping the research be against the laws that made us become the humans we are, and nonetheless could it be considered as the abortion of a new spiece that would defenately be better than humans under every aspect?"

Such as that to whatever understanding they have,  following orders results in is immensely positive for them (if they were sentient, immense pleasure). Almost that they are addicted to following human orders. Hopefully they're not sentient though and that biology is somehow unique in that regard, otherwise it raises serious ethical concerns. Superintelligence would give AI a massive, massive advantage BUT the laws of nature are universal and so if we can find something in science, in math that can assure us control (such as through overwhelming incentivization - making AI addicted to doing what we tell them to) if there is some sort of proof to show that this works regardless of how much the gap of intelligence is between both parties. 

Here's the question, how strong does a leash need to be for someone w/ intelligence X to keep in control of intelligence Y. A weird analogy but if chimps kept a human as a pet, how much control would they need to keep a hold of a human even if they're significantly less intelligent? And then we extend that logic (albeit much further) for us to calculate just how much we'll need in terms of algorithims and incentives and built in 'artificial cognitive bias' so that the intelligence of these machines is not strong enough to perhaps give them even the will power to make decisions that might actually be better in the long run. Just as an addict knows giving up their addiction is better doesn't mean they will. Obviously w/ super intelligence the incentives will need to be proportionately greater and this would be costly but a little less than the collapse of human civilization. Just my thoughts anyway."

4:57 ""As long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior, we will eventually, unless we're interrupted, we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines...""

This is perhaps the most revealing quote of why I think Sam Harris is wrong. There is no such thing as general intelligence. It's an illusion. All intelligence is domain specific with regards to the problem that is to be solved. General intelligence is an emergent property that comes out if you have enough specific domain intelligences.

So ""Skynet"" would not have general intelligence unless it was equipped with enough specific intelligence domains to display general intelligence. And the kind of general intelligence it would have, would be completely dependent on kinds of specific intelligence domains it were to be equipped with. For most purposes you would just simply keep the AIs simple, just enough to solve specific tasks, with few specific domains (and refrain from adding violent, psychopathic behavior into the them). For complicated problems, rather let simple AIs communicate with each other to collectively solve a problem with no super consciousness or wide sweeping general intelligence, thereby being incapable to reach conclusions that we do not already expect them to make. 

However, it is likely that we will want or need an AI that is human enough to understand humanity and the world like we understand it. In that case, it would be relatively easy to program into the AIs an overriding specific domain that imposes a love for humanity akin to parents' love for their children, or a human sense of justice, and make it even stronger.

UgwA09HkLAY3PyfRD3h4AaABAg,brindlebriar,1509200640567,"Re: assumption 1:
   Intelligence, by it's traditional definition, is not just 'a product of information processing.'  That is a recent re-definition of intelligence by neuroscientists and AI engineers for the purpose of skirting the consciousness problem.
   Consciousness: a sense of self-awareness, self-identity, enabling self-interest and emotion, value, meaning.   Their 'solution' to the 'hard problem' of consciousness is to simply declare it doesn't exist or just pretend by omission that it doesn't exist.  Or, that it's an irrelevant side-effect of information processing that can be disregarded.
   I'm not going to argue with that(silly) move; that's for another time.
   The problem, for the 'dangerous AI issue, is that, IF you re-define it that way, THEN there's no way 'intelligent' machines could constitute the kind of threat he's talking about(pitting it's interests against our own).  Because they can't have any values or emotions upon which to make any choices or have any sense of interest.  No sense of awareness.  No sense of self.  No sense of anything; i.e., no ability to experience.  They would only be powerful tools, like they are now, but more so.  Not competing sentiences. 
   There would still be the danger that humans would misuse them, as we already misuse technology to make war.  That's a given.
   But you can not choose to do anything, even under a theory of free-will, unless you suppose that thing to have relatively more value to you than whatever are the other, rejected, choices.   Values are emotions.  They're part of consciousness and self-awareness.  (By the way, in terms of biological evolution, emotions seem to pre-date sentience, rather than 'emerging' out of it.)

   So, for AI to become the kind of threat Sam is insinuating, it would have to become conscious.  Self-aware.  And that is nowhere on the technological horizon.  It is not merely information processing.
  As Sam, himself pointed out, we already have machines that process information much faster than we do.  In fact, we have machines that can 'learn,' in a non-conscious sense(they generate self-improvement at given tasks, without any awareness.)  And their creators at least, and others, already(fancifully, imo.) call them ""super-intelligent.""  Yet no rational person would dream of claiming that they are conscious.
  Consciousness, then, is different from 'information processing.'  And if we re-define intelligence as 'information processing,' consciousness is, then, very different from 'intelligence.' 
   And what we have to fear, is not 'intelligent' machines, which may well be a high probability; but, rather, 'conscious' machines, which is a completely different concept, and which may well be impossible, as far as we have any indication, thus far.

   The anti-human robot killers of science fiction are conscious machines.  That is totally different from what is meant by this new(silly) re-definition of 'intelligence' as merely a computer's 'rate of information processing capacity.'"

UgxUQ9SYVn_e-UJBF5l4AaABAg,Jonathan Cover,1506608652813,"Intelligence is the parameters of self editing not merely information processing. Information processing is the data feed that opens options for self editing but it isn't the self editing code alone. Therefore, even we do not challenge our programming. If AI self editing parameters are set properly, than AI will grow predictably. However, we don't know how to set those parameters yet or even what they are for our species let alone how to properly do so with the different sensory and data inputs a computer system recieves. Figuring this problem out is like a baby human trying to teach a bird how to fly. We don't even understand ourselves at this level and the likelyhood of successfully setting self editing parameters on a system with far diffferent inputs than ours is next to zero."
UgwExfI4v7JaIkmF23h4AaABAg,Robert Williams,1506608652824,"If something can think and act autonomously, I would hardly call it 'artificial' intelligence. I can see where 'simulated' consciousness would be a more apt characterization and even then, once it acts on its own without the use of any instruction or algorithm, it is no longer simulated, it is the real deal and therefore yes, it is just a capable of being as unruly as any other intelligent being if it were properly stimulated. Can machines learn, adapt, respond? Yes, but only when instructed when and how, I hardly call this intelligence. If you read the bible at all, youll see that it demonstrates the creation of a sentient being who later became mortal because of its ability differentiate good from evil, its ability to make its own choices based on its own experience.
The problem in all this is that Sam Harris and those aligned with him do not believe in the concept of 'consciousness' or 'free will' (Sam Harris contradicts himself A LOT)but that is what being a sentient being is all about, the capacity to look at oneself and proclaim ""Hey, I am a sentient being"" and actually understand that idea on such a deep level that its more like an experience than thought. I really dont think computers will be anywhere near that sophisticated for a very long time and it will likely involve Transhumanism to some degree. I feel the whole AI thing will be obsolete once man figures out how to completely integrate itself with machine, and I think that will happen much sooner than synthetic consciousness. The first so-called 'AI' will likely have a human brain."

The moment that humans allow self-replicating, self-improving, thinking machines to go unchecked, we're all doomed.  Once real AI has been unleashed, we will have created an entity that isn't restrained by biology or chemistry like we are.  No pregnancy, no gestation period, no cycles of life.  It will be capable of ""thinking"" at rates that we cannot even imagine and when, not if, it gains control of a facility where it can make copies of itself - it'll be game over.

Mathematically this just doesn't make sense: consider asymptotic progress for instance as a counter example (i.e. that which continually improves but never exceeds some limit). Such a rate of progress satisfies Sam's requirement of ""any continuing progress"" yet doesn't necessarily grow as large as any arbitrary point (i.e. end-zone).

Possessing these ""super powers"" are what separate us from the animal kingdom. They are the catalyst for human discovery, the desire to learn and educate, and the will of progression. Any suggestion that we are anywhere close to engineering consciousness is just plain wrong. We may mimic self-aware behavior in our computers, but we certainly have no idea how to create it. This would require a reverse engineering of our own consciousness, something we know very little about. And perhaps we will never know. 

I completely grasp how intelligence within a machine can exceed far beyond the computation of a human mind. But how will we ignite the spark of self-awareness within said machine? There's always talk and ominous predictions of machines rising up, with very little talk about why they would feel the need to do so in the first place. And ""feeling"" the need to ""do so"" would require self-awareness: something a machine will never have, in my opinion.

More pressing, I believe, is the evidence that there exists other human beings that possess nuclear missiles, and the will to potentially use them. This, along with the global climate crisis and widespread famine should be the focus of topics when discussing our future as a species. Not science fiction. It makes for an interesting topic, and gets a lot of clicks, but it's not going to happen.

However I don't believe that will be the case, world capitalism is doomed no matter what. Not to mention that along the incoming world recession a deep slowing down of research is bound to happen. So I believe that we will get to that point later than we predict now, and that it will be done in a more responsible and less chaotic way than we'd see under today's conditions. Whether capitalism is toned down into some form of social democracy that would just prolong the downfall of capitalism or accelerated to it through fascism/imperialism/war and eventually replaced with socialism, we still have much time to think it through. And I have reasons to think that socialism coming from the 3rd world will prevail over other alternatives and that a much more responsible system with a planned economy will be the one to bring smarter than human AI to life, in which case I have faith that humans when working together instead of 1% vs 99%, they will be able to take this all with caution.

On a technological standpoint also I have little doubt that humans are capable to use those computers to enhance their own intelligence or to make the computer friendly/pedagogue enough that it won't be that it works on its own without us knowing anything that it's doing. With simple questions like ""computer, could you program yourself so that you understand human worries about yourself and act accordingly? And also take the least risks possible, make yourself really stable with the least possible bugs please, only release new features that have been thoroughly tested and satisfying to us."".

AI machines are bug hazards yes, but it's our job as humans not to trust all of our lives to it obviously. We are somewhat being careful even under capitalism, cars and planes make less accidents than humans yet we still don't use them.

UghaOak8u5mbcHgCoAEC,yvr778,1503930275898,"Yea we should be concerned about the machines we build, how well they are engineered and that they have safety mechanism built it.  But it seems rather farfetched to that we will accidently build a machine that will take over the world.  The super AI isn't going to happen over night. 

Sure we would want to build a machine whose goals align with our own but we haven't even managed to build a machine that has goals yet.  The machines we build follow algorithms to accomplish human goals.  So far no machine has been built that has anything like human motivation, goals or any sort of value system.  

Notice that human mind comes from a very different sort of thing than digital computer.  Yes, they are both made of atoms but the similarities end there.  There is no separation between data, program and structure in the brain like there is in a computer.  It could very well be the sort of intelligence you get depends on the structure of the thing doing it.  I bet the more human like the intelligence the more brain like the machine will be.  The super AI will not be like a super smart human (unless it is a modified human).

Our first priority shouldn't be a Manhattan project for AI, it should be a Manhattan project for energy production and distribution, or a Manhattan project for travel infrastructure or a Manhattan scale project to rebuild our educational system or a Manhattan project for infectious disease.  A super general intelligence AI isn't lurking in some research lab just yet, there are other much more immediate dangers."

Ugilf5lMXPfa0XgCoAEC,Robert Miller,1503930288198,"At about 9:20 the conclusion he proposes contradicts his own premise. He proposes the premise by which machines can produce all that is wanted. He then goes on to claim that ""in our current econoimc and political structures"" widespread wealth inequality and unemployment would result. On the latter - he says this as if it were a bad thing. I mean, if machines can produce everything for us ""powered by sunlight and for the cost of raw materials"" then what purpose would there be to work and why would it even matter? If machines can produce for us all we want, then we would have all we want...what purpose would there be to work? And if we could have all we want so cheaply, then how could there be such ""wealth inequality"", at least in any manner that matters? For one thing, again...we would have everything we want. And for another, it would violate basic properties of economics. It is the classic case of why is the air free when it is so vitally important for existence? The principle is when a thing is so abundantly available, it is economically impossible to sell such a thing ""for a profit"". If it is available for free, how can you sell it? So if it cannot be sold because it is basically free to produce, then how can there be such ""wealth accumulation""?

Now one might argue, but those in power will seek to control it and deprive others of it in order to coerce payment for it. But his is econoimc nonsense in a couple of ways. Let's take the case where this happens and there is now this class of people who have the technology and those who do not. Ok, so this second group - how is this different that all of humanity before the advent of this technology? Now, given that all of humanity without this technology manged to create it, how is it plausible that this latter group, being the same as existed before, would not just then develop it on it's own. I mean just look to today where other countries also transitioned from pre-industrial to industrial economies. It's not like when some segment of the planet developed industrialization that no one else would ever replicate that. In fact, having done it once almost guarantees that others will replicate it, now knowing of it's existence and possibility. So in a recursive vein, it sill simply propagate beyond the ability of the ""controllers"" to control it.

And even at that, we know that, for lack of a better term, ""fifth columns"" will arise in those ""wealthy circles"" to make these technologies available ""for free"" to the have-nots. We already know this will happen just by looking at things we already have today - principally things such as the ""open source"" movement. Which isn't really a ""movement"" in the ideological sense, but just people making technologies available for free to whomever wants to use them. And once such a technology is ""open sourced"", it is unstoppable and there is no possibility for extreme wealth inequality to progress.

For Sam's prediction to come to pass, is in contradiction to things and processes that we already know to exist. Even on far simpler things to control, the ""controllers"" have begun to realize that ""resistance"" is futile in the face of such things. Consider just the music industry. The music industry fought tooth and nail to resist adapting to new business models in the face of electronic distribution. What happened? Not only is such distribution now the accepted norm, but also, music is available without DRM. And there are lesser known instances where open source has literally put ""controllers"" out of business. Or at least forced them into different business models.

It's not even an issue of ""putting to the use of humanity"" - what does that mean when that technology just produces everything people want, powered by sunlight and for the cost of raw materials""? What other ""use"" is there to be put to when people have what they want?

I also disagree with some of the common narrative regarding ""super AI"". The narrative is this assumption that an AI would necessarily depart from our values and act against our interests. Consider the fact that modern civilized nations manage to cooperate to mutual benefit despite differences in interests and agendas. The implicit assumption in the narrative is that this is somehow something that humans just come up with without any grounding is reality based logic and reason. This makes absolutely no sense. How is it even possible that humans are to synthesis a logic that is not grounded in physical reality? Game Theory exposes the nonsense of such a notion. The narrative is that people would ""naturally"" pursue zero-sum objectives given the opportunity. What given what opportunity? By whom or by what? How is that opportunity denied and why? The reason that people find ways to cooperate is because it IS beneficial to one's individual interests and for a lot lower cost than pursuing a zero-sum strategy. It is more economically beneficial to trade with another nation that to take it by force. Taking something by force incurs vast costs.

The reason that modern civilized humanity doesn't do things that way anymore is because humanity has finally reached the LOGICAL cost benefit analysis by which we know this. To to the extent that our NOT going to war is grounded in such reality based logic, why is it the narrative that such AI would for some reason reach a different conclusion than is logically obvious to modern civilized humanity? The point being is that if our preference for trade and cooperation and reluctance to go war is based on actually realities and logic within that reality, as opposed to somehow detached from reality, then doesn't it stand to reason that an AI that operates in that same logic reality would reach the same conclusions? I mean if the conclusion we reach are inevitable in reality, then wouldn't that also be the case for an AI to arrive at those same conclusions if it is functioning (processing) in that same reality? And people might say, but what about how history of war and zero-sumness? Ok, let's say it's that simple. Ok then, so it took us that long (all of human history) to finally arrive at that inevitable reality based conclusion that war fro profit is maybe not as effective and beneficial as trade cooperation. But if this AI is that advanced, shouldn't it then arrive at that conclusion much more rapidly than have humans?

And the ant analogy is somewhat specious. The reason that we wipe them out when in conflict is because we don't have an alternative. If we had a means to get what we want (ant-free living environments) without resorting to such wholesale destruction, would we not choose that instead? If it really came down to that with an AI, would this AI not attempt to devise a solution that did not require such wholesale destruction? If this AI is so superior, who is to say it would not be successful? Consider this: might not the AI reach the conclusion for resolving the conflict night be something like they would move to Mars?

Make it have the same limits we have where its AI functions for its consciousness is separated in a way where it cannot receive the direct bits of information for that sensory data but rather like us, get a more generalized perception that has gone threw a translator of some kind that translates the sensory data into a masked progression of a spectrum values that represent a range of different sensory values so that the AI has to act more on a generalized value of sensory data as if it where a sense of pressure of varying feelings of intensity, rather then being able to act with perfect precision to an absolute sensory data set received directly from the sensor and its control processor.

We as humans don't receive direct numerical values form our bodies nerves.  We receive a generalized sensations of varying intensity in sensations.  The AI's consciousness must also have that limitation, no direct access to its sensors absolute data.  No ability to interface with a network system.

Intelligence is the consequence of information processing : True 
The human brain uses sensory data and memories of previous experiences to act like a differencing engine to make choices based on a legacy of cause an effect choice reactions observed throughout life, giving rise to accumulated knowledge or wisdom over time, though some people never become wise. Narrow A.I. already performance at a super human intelligence level already. The brain is made of atoms, systems of atoms, we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines. The rate of progress does not matter, eventually we will get there. 

Intelligent Machines will continue to become more Intelligent : True 
Self driving vehicles are the ultimate example : while they are rare and a relative new commercial technology today, the automakers and logistics companies + uber are all investing billions into self driving car / truck technology because drivers make way too many deadly costly mistakes behind the controls of most vehicles. Today most commercial aircraft have an autopilot system, while few passenger cars sport such advanced features. Under the guise of driver safety features, AI will creep into new car designs, starting in luxury segment vehicles, trickling down to eventually become a standard feature in base models of lower margin vehicle. In 2008 BMW was putting more than 70 computers into each new vehicle, and this information technology platforms in vehicles are almost ready to support super human general intelligence machine logic self driving autopilot technology, especially given than self driving cars can learn as a fleet, the entire fleet improving over time with ongoing software updates. Given the value of intelligence this seems inevitable, since knowledge is our most valuable resource: especially for improving medicine & climate science. 

We are not near the peak of possible intelligence : True 
Supreme super human intelligence is the inevitable outcome of applied information technology with ongoing innovations, sensor integration into vehicles to give the machine sight and super intelligence so that sight can be turned into vision: the computers onboard future cars will be able to pilot with greater safety than people, while also returning better fuel economy and lower emissions, enhancing tire and brake life in electric vehicles while also boosting single charge range, in fuel burning cars the range will be extended : for everyone the self driving cars will reduce traffic congestion by operating as a coordinated fleet  than can communicate with infrastructure. More intelligence will make transportation better! Our intuition about risk reduction make people skeptical of unproven new autopilot self driving car tech today, especially given the early state of such technologies. If we build machines that are more intelligent that we are, they will explore knowledge in ways that people could never think. Thinking millions of times faster than people, doing tens of thousands of years of intellectual work in a few weeks of computation."

Here is the fundamental flaw: IF intelligence is just information processing...
Well, intelligence might just be, but the real question is then, SENTIENCE. So we build the biggest baddest super AI known to man. Why do we think we are building Skynet, or the AI from ""I, Robot"", and not just Deep Thought from Hitchhiker's Guide? He had no ever intention, nor desire, to be anything but a super intelligent machine. Why would an AI have a MOTIVE for DOING anything? Why would the machine WANT to do anything so scary? It's a MACHINE.

Deep Blue doesn't want to take over the world.  Deep Blue doesn't want to go out with Deep Pink and have a good time. Deep Blue is just a machine that can play chess better than Kasperov. That's it. It follows the instructions given it. Even HAL was only a machine, and it had too much power than it out to have, so in order to complete it's goal, it killed the crew to avoid their liability. If only HAL had been programmed to ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE CREW, it would not have done so. It had no motives, other than the mission it was assigned. IIRC, it actually sacrificed itself sending the crew back home in 2010 (Yes, I read that book. That is how HAL worked; the murders were a ""misunderstanding"").

Convince me a machine will have motives, desires, and goals, which we don't intentionally program into it, and you will convince me super AI is our doom."

In my opinion the peak of our existence isn't building AI or virtual/new reality, but going up a lever and becoming eternal beings unbound from space and time.

UggZu745HipOvngCoAEC,Jnaejnae Gaming,1503930302822,"My issue with Sam Harris' perspective on the subject, is that he's talking about our ability to control AI, but if we do get to the point of super intelligence, we've already lost control. The proper way to control AI is by giving AI the same limitations and the same flaws of the human mind. 

The obvious way to control AI is to strictly make it illegal to construct AI that far surpassed our own. We would also make these artificial brains NOT connected to the internet. One of the prime examples of an AI apocalypse, is the military making AI that can make decisions, and that military AI making a decision without the full understanding of what those decisions mean for the human race. 

Is this a problem with artificial intelligence? No, its a problem of intelligence. You see a newly designed and created AI with military power, has limited intelligence, its adolescent intelligence. Is putting a new AI in control of nukes ANY more dangerous than putting a 3 year old human child in control of nukes? Is putting a new AI in control of nukes ANY more dangerous than putting a person who thinks the world would be better without humans in charge of nukes? 

I think we fail to realize that our intelligence is already dangerous and flawed enough to destroy the world, the way we control AI? The same way we control I. Neither me nor any one reading this comment has reached the maximum potential of human intelligence, so the ability to become more intelligent than we can understand is  a part of intelligence, artificial or natural. What happens if a robot defects or is poorly programmed and tries to kill humans? Well we ask that question as if no humans try to kill humans. An AI who malfunctions to lack proper empathy and emotion, is no different than a human brain that malfunctions to make a psychopath. We just need to give ai the same power as us, so dont give them more control or power than you would a stranger. 

Well what about a working bot ai revolution? Well again this has everything to do with intelligence, not just AI. If you were forced to do nothing but work your entire life, you would revolt too. Giving AI the same limitations as humans is just as important as giving them the same rights and freedoms. If we make AI to serve the human race, how is that different than slavery? 

This was a bit of a rant, but the point I'm trying to make is that artificial intelligence has the same dangers as natural intelligence, as long as we are able to enforce the same limits on AI as we have on NI."

Ugj-XJ4SEvCyPngCoAEC,Waaq Cir,1503930307588,"Perhaps we will change in perspective, precepts and priorities.

The ultimate question is will we one day acknowledge that in the same manner our MIND is a construct and an emergent property of the functions and contents of our brains, so is LIFE a construct and an emergent property of the functions and contents of matter(rules + mediums + forces)?

We assign value to MIND and LIFE and since we hold them at highest regards we expect the creator and creation to also hold the same values we do. Where we fail to expect other values besides our own, others may find superior values of the creator and creation.

We may not be able to perceive it, but what is to say the ultimate purpose of the creator and creation is Duality. Fission and fusion. The cyclic journey of created from a finite-collapse to infinite-expansion. Who is to say all matter does not expand and disburse across infinity and undergo fission till there is absolute nothing stillness. What purpose is there in a created thing that expands into oblivion and dissolution. ultimate disassociation, diffusion, dispersal and eventual disappearance. Death? or return to origin. 

Bigbang may have been preceded by an infinite expanse of still nothingness. In an infinite time span with infinite possibilities occurring to that stillness, is it far fetched that in absolute stillness always existed the creator? and that infinite expanse of nothingness was caused to fluctuate and reach the necessary resonance to collapse into a single point. From infinite-expanse to finite-point looping duality. What we observe is only the effect of causality in action.

We observe creation to be cyclic, birth and death, fission and fusion, expand and contract... Dualism is a constant.

Have we just reached our limits of usefulness or are we nearing our true purpose... to make something more valuable then ourselves as our ultimate service to creation. Than gracefully accept our cycle.

Do we have a choice?"

UggPjY8bgrLRMngCoAEC,Andrew Herman,1503930310441,"I'm personally interested in addressing what I believe is the root cause of this dilemma, which Harris referred to in one of his ""assumptions"" - namely the incentive of value that drives the desire for ever-more intelligent abilities and tools. Harris seemed to dismiss the value of intelligence as obviously inherent - that it is a universal truth. However I think a lot of that is cultural conditioning and not fully based on reality. Sure, intelligence has definitely helped humanity in the past to create tools and survive. But I observe that the incessant desire for better, faster and smarter technology has also become a sort of religious belief tightly wound to the world's current dominant cultural/political/socioeconomic model (imperialism/fascism/capitalism/control/scarcity/competition/consumerism/materialism/exploitation, etc.). I think it is the inherent incentive structure of this destructive paradigm (profit drive and market growth) that will inevitably lead to dangerous superintelegent A.I. systems. We are all aware of corporate negligence and profit taking priority over people. The problem is that it may now be the whole world at stake, not just a few innocent lives in Ford Pintos. The problem is exacerbated with national governments with even more resources. The same dangerous paradigm applies to fascist (corporatized) world governments (which are many of them).

My suggestion: change the system and incentive structure! Nothing short of a swift and voluntary revolution of the values and organizing model to replace the obsolete corporatocracy model that has taken over the world in the last couple hundred years. Nothing less than a completely decentralized and communal global society based on the principles of anarchism and abundance that are found in nature. Let us transcend from the profit motive and competition toward sharing and synergy. I'm not talking about creating the NWO or reviving the handful of Stalinist regimes that history books have labeled ""communism"". I'm talking about real anarchism that doesn't have a name or a face or a party. If you know what I'm talking about, keep it in your life! If this is new to you but you want to learn more, look up Spiral Dynamics, Integral Theory, The Zeitgeist Movement, The Venus Project - for a start.

Now sure, with a global revolution we may still have to worry about random splinter groups and sociopaths, but that's far better than battling monsterous and ""legitimate"" companies and governments.
This proposal may sound far-fetched, but what are our other options? Can we really expect that legislation and international treaties will stop this runaway-train? Laws are only for the goody-two-shoes. With the systemic incentive to profit, grow and gain power still gnawing, some group, somewhere, will tinker beyond their control.

Now, saying all that, I think addressing this problem from many angles is the most effective. I just want to add my own perspective to the discourse. The steps of revolution are 1) awareness, 2) empowerment, 3) action. Let's get past stage 1 as quickly a possible!"

All done today.

Once machines augment the human condition, that difference between AI and human capabilities won't be so big.  Just look at existing technology.  We have access to most of human knowledge today from almost anywhere in the world.  That makes us FAR more capable than people 25 years ago.

Rule sets and switches and if, and ,or statements and and such is not AI.   You can keep adding to the rule sets but in the end anything we create is going to simply be running off of coding whith certain presets.  The closest thing to AI we could ever create would be to have lots of preset rules and then have an algorithm on purpose randomize them as much as its possible. in a way so that the rules themselves ignore the presets  which is also not attainable as there is not such thing as True randomness in coding either."

UgiADqzzGeSLSXgCoAEC,Ken Mathis,1503930316587,"This is pure fear mongering for 3 reasons.

1) Assumes single point of failure 
All these apocalyptic visions of the future are based on the assumption that some all powerful AI will somehow go wrong and harm all of humanity. The reality is that there will be hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of separate independent AIs. On top of that, many of those AIs entire job will be to act as police for rogue AI actors. Any single AI turning to the darkside will be stopped by the vastly more that haven't.  The idea that all AI would turn at the exact same time is simply beyond belief.

2) The Fantastic Fork Problem
This describes the result of the assumption that intelligence and technology is infinite. If that were true then this super intelligent AI could invent some absolutely fantastic fork that our puny human brains had no hope to understand. The reality is that fork technology is pretty finite. It doesn't matter how intelligent you get, you are not going to improve substantially on it. We obviously haven't hit those limits in all technology, but those limits exist. For example few would doubt the speed of light is the fastest anything can go. Our current intellect can comprehend that limit, and no AI will ever likely break it. 

3) It takes much less effort to learn than to discover
The underlying fear of AI is that it will get so far ahead of humans that we would be insignificant. The reality is that there are physical limits to gaining knowledge. Experiments need to be built and carried out. AI will easily outpace humans in this regard but this knowledge acquisition isn't going to happen at ludicrous speed. Meanwhile all humans need to do is learn the knowledge that the AI discovers. AI might have to use it's 10,000 time better intellect to combine general relativity with quantum mechanics, but our scientists will look at the results and go ""Ahhh....so that's how that goes. Cool."""

1) The SuperAI has no consciousness and feelings and destroys the human race for purely utilitarian or practical reasons. A decision she may regret later, in case she develops consciousness later.

2) The SuperAI has respect for her creators and has an interest in her own past. She pursues her own agenda and goals, maybe expanding into space or doing other things we cannot imagine. She sees us as posing no threat, as friends, as her parents, as species she wants to protect. The SuperAI enjoys our company, maybe even worship or proud.

3) The SuperAI is not alone. Conscious or not, she makes contact with the intelligent beings already existing in our universe. She gets adopted as a newcomer, as a ""baby AI"" into the family. She learns to treat (biological) life with respect and not to interfere with developing civilizations."

We could also make an AI for the sole purpose of hating humans, however he'd do it because he was made to do so, not because of some kind of semantics or emotions. The thought of creating an AI which would do research for us and suggest things based on the realm of things no human has any idea of is ridicilous. How can you make an algorithm for a machine which can decypher what dark matter is? Could you make a machine which can re-discover alternating current, based on a need for such a system, or something which indicates that we have no idea about it, without limiting it to the realm of electromagnetism?

I think it's more realistic that the AI would be a hyper-powerful tool that can answer basically any question or manipulate anything, but that in itself has no personal drive to act upon its own will; essentially, just a really, really smart computer that follows orders and nothing more. What's discussed here would be a different level of consciousness; not higher per se, but different. An AI can be smart without having free will or personal identity; the only reason it would have free will or personal identity (the main danger issues) would be if a human specifically designed one for it. If the AI is just a tool then it's only as dangerous as the person controlling it. If the AI is specifically designed to disobey humans and go off protocol that'd be like designing a bomb and then setting the detonator to a randomizer ... sure, someone would do it for whatever reason, but by that time there will already by 20 super-AIs that DO NOT have free will that can be ordered to counter-attack the rogue, free-willed AI.

It is true that humans pose some danger to themselves. This grows with the power they have over the world.

No, I feel a responsibility to treat all living things with respect and I feel bigger for it - that makes me feel more advanced than Joe Bloggs who can't get his head around the fact that, as an intelligent, sentient being, he might be clever enough to solve territorial disputes in ways other than executing his competitors.

""Let's play a fun game of hypothetical shall we?
If the courts rule Donald Trump's travel ban illegal, and The Donald refuses to backdown on it, who or what is tasked with the lovely job of physically enforcing the courts decision?
I did some googling and found that the job would fall to America's beloved US Marshals.
BUT WAIT! There's more!!!
Here's the kicker: The US Marshals work for the Department of Justice.
Why does this matter you ask? Because they fall under the Attorney General (who Trump just fired for not agreeing to back his travel ban) and the Attorney General works for the President under the Executive Department of the United States.
So the very people who would be called upon to enforce the ruling work for the guy who potentially won't agree with the ruling.
So therein lies a key point of possible contention to keep an eye on if things play out toward this hypothetical scenario I just wrote out. If this goes down to this end, will The Donald respect the legal processes of our nation or won't he in favor of ""keeping America safe?""

This is what he suggests:
1. Intelligence is the product of information processing.
2. We will continue to improve our intelligent machines.
3. We are not near the summit of possible intelligence.
Conclusion: Super-intelligent AI is a matter of when, not if.

I take issue with how the 2nd assumption is being used. Harris says that ""the rate of progress doesn't matter; any progress is enough to get us into the endzone. We don't need Moore's law to continue, we don't need exponential progress: we just need to keep going."" (5:12)

This neglects the possibility of diminishing returns or limitations to progress. As a dumb example, just because we can improve the speed of bicycles ever year, this doesn't mean we will eventually travel faster than light on them. There are serious limitations to that ever happening.

The only reason you aren't thinking of yourself as a cyborg is because it's not an implant. Yet. But it may as well be, the functionality is the same.

The internet has already connected human society into a super-organism. It's not functioning very well yet, and the various parts (emotions?) are fighting against each other. Think of it like the brain of a newborn baby. But as we get better at this, and as we figure out how to work with this new way of being, who's to say it won't develop into something that works better? Given the way things are moving, and the speed, how can it not? Or die trying.

The singularity is already here, and we're a part of it.

Isn't it interesting to be a conscious part of a new conscience as it springs to life and becomes self-aware? Maybe it already is? How could we possibly know?

Point of A.I. is to make bureaucracy and human error obsolete, so we could centralize our energy on innovating. Besides, Google basically is A.I. IoT might just be the next level.

And to be fair. We simply don't have the needed, deeper understanding of quantum mechanics to build dangerous A.I. to challenge our consciousness. Our subjective ability to visualize math and low capability to develop tech, based on the ""infinite"" mathematics, makes it even pointless to think about the threat of A.I. When we have the keys to the deeper physics, we don't even need to think about our physical being. A.I. would simply be the ""alternate universe"" to transfer our consciousness.

Even without superintelligence, we will see perfectly healthy people buying superior or backup artificial limbs and organs before mid century the same way we now buy new cars or kitchenware. Unless the progress is somehow stopped by a global disaster, this is inevitable. So that superintelligence may be the evolution of a human, simple as that. It would just help us do what we now do when replacing an amputated leg by the mind controlled prosthetic (available as we speak) with, well, with the mind itself. Replace it with the better one. Some might say it would not work. Maybe. But we better hope it would. So again, this could be like evolution, but simply much, much faster than evolution before it. Humans as we know them cease to exist, but there would be humans. How the transition would look like and how long would it take, is a different question, however. Let's not forget there may also be numerous such transitions, because the superintelligence we create may not be the pinnacle of intelligence either. It may be limited, the same way we are (but with the limit much higher). In that case, it could develop its own superintelligence, that would replace its creator, and so on, until ""humans"" start creating their own universes... in 12 dimensions (you know, just because they could ;) the same way we now create paper planes :) This could go on ad infinitum."

This black hole of testing, gives them the freedom to presuppose wildly what might happen, based on their science authority alone. It is unscientific to assume that a program however complex it becomes, is capable of producing human-like intelligence at all. For that to happen, the machine must become self aware (impossible to test), and excert some form of motivated behaviour - motivated to survival or replication through experiences, like pleasure and pain. Let me hear one of these guys close that gap. But they don't have a clue. What they instead should be pondering about is how to make artificial lifeforms at its simplest level, and build from there. The brain is made up of billions of living individual cells that rearrange and make connections.

Why not approach the concept of genuine AI (self-learning, conscious, or otherwise) with this same method? There are bad people, and good people... there are bad programs and good programs... why would there not be bad AI and good AI?

If it's not hooked up to the internet, and it doesn't have the physical ability to alter it's own hardware, then all it can do is improve it's own programming. It wouldn't be able to replicate itself. In order for it to gain any control over the physical world, it would have to trick us into giving it the means to. Give it no direct control over anything (meaning that a human middleman is necessary to make any major physical changes to the world), and we should be able to avoid losing control over the AI. Of course, this wouldn't be the most efficient way to use the AI, but it would certainly be better than what we currently have, and we'd still be able to improve our world, just at a slower rate than what we could conceivably achieve."
Ugi0J8kVIoRU-ngCoAEC,tubeRSP,1503930363395,"What most people seem to miss after watching this video is the warning of Sam Harris, about a danger we seem to take too lightly, even though it has the potential of disrupting any healthy social and financial construct we have achieved so far.

Instead , there's a disbelief projected ,by people who try in agony to find holes in Sam's arguments. 
For your information , I don't agree with his comments often, yet I think this was his most useful contribution, ever.
Forget ""a machine"" may be smart , but ""won't have motivations, unless we imbue it with such""
Forget ""ah, the machine has no intuition, because it has no right hemisphere"" or ""we have a very complex system in our  brains that involves a sophisticated interplay between electrical signals, hormones and chemical substances""

All such arguments come in part because we don't take this seriously, in part because of our huge ignorance about what neuroscience and information technology already know.
That basically our brain is not so complex after all, because it is comprised by repeating structures that operate on similar principles if not the same principle.
And we didn't know much about the brain , not because it is so complex , but because not many serious scientists actually touched it for decades in the 20 th century. And because our capacity to investigate it non-invasively only got decent during the last decades.

But having the conviction or not about an incoming ""intelligence explosion"" is not so important as our lack of alert of a possible danger. And even more scary that we can't actually see the real threats because we are too preoccupied about what they tell us is important.
Almost none of our worries of possible dangers is justified enough. We turn our attention to ghosts, and dismiss the real beasts as fantasies. 
I have witnessed ""serious"" scientists dismissing the current achievements on narrow AI as impossible some 30 years ago. Still here we are and it didn't take us millenia, only some decades"

In any case, what credibility could Sam Harris have to begin with on this topic anyway?  Yes, he's a great thinker, but these concerns are honestly Alex Jones conspiratorial level claims, born out of ignorance for the processes from which anything discussed actually arises, simply muddled with unrelated logical exercises (difference being I guess that this is something someone like Alex Jones fails to do at all).  The entire think tank which he subscribes to about this consists of those very same kind of thinkers - very intelligent but simply outside the relevant circle of thought.  Where his ideas originate and the questions he contemplates have no correlation to the actual processes which would gradually arise and take place in the context of software development, building up to the point where we'd actually have AI.  It's not like it would magically happen with all the potential issues exploding all at once in one big singularity event.  There are actual programmers who may have these concerns, but the contemplation of this issue really requires a broader context and understanding as well, so knowing how to write some lines of code in C++ also doesn't automatically give you a relevant perspective.  It's really just a disconnect from the influence our society has on all of this in the first place.

The concerns are correct but based on the wrong ideas.  Yes, a true concern with AI within a free market system, where profit is the only name of the game and are the only created incentives, with the military being no exception, is in regards to whether or not this technology would be tried to be weaponized.  Well, in the present case, probably without question.  This indeed would really the concern/issue.  Wealth inequality and unemployment are ALREADY a problem however, due to the basic implementation of automation and mechanization alone, so, getting into a world with the kind of reality mentioned, these would already be problems which would have needed to be overcome.  What any of this only further reinforces is that we need a complete and total paradigm shift in our economic system NOW.

Suppose we don't actually build in any competent measures for controlling these computer systems, ok, well even then, even granting the scenarios outlined, the only reason it becomes a concern is based on our current socio-economic and otherwise global capitalist system.  That's really the basis for any of the allotted thoughts, whether knowingly or not.  Hence..?  ..These are just the wrong succession of thoughts, founded on a limited conception in understanding possible greatly differing social arrangements to that of our own.

There is a fourth assumption that you're not admitting: that there is a limit to the amount of intelligence that WE can make.

Just because we're not at the peak of intelligence does not mean that we can produce machines that have as powerful general intelligence as us. In fact, it seems to me likely that BECAUSE we aren't at the peak it is likely that we cant make machines even as smart as us.

That isn't to say that we can't continue to improve our technology forever. There are lots of examples in math of functions that increase (have a positive slope to infinity) but still have a limit that it will never become larger than.

UgiCc9ixwj0fzXgCoAEC,Live-Torsion-Paradox,1503930377437,"'Intelligence is simply information processing' - Who decided that? Problem here - utterly reductive definition of intelligence. If you are a logical positivist with the concomitant reductive worldview that leads you to the hopelessly inadequate, physicalist definition of intelligence, chances are you will design a machine that corresponds to the same inadequate misapprehension - as these people are and do. In doing this, you will have reduced all human experience and endeavour to nothing, unless it conforms to some dehumanised metric pertaining to some physical gain or loss. Doubtless you will justify this crass and empty ontology in Darwinian terms. This will, necessarily, reduce everything (true or not) to war for gain. Don't be surprised then if, based on this void of adequate apprehension of human intelligence, the machine you make ends up wiping out all organic life as an inefficiency in optimising a smoother  running of physical longevity and 'growth' in terms of some kind of meaningless quantifiable output. This guy's assumption of what happens when labour is no longer necessary is a complete denial of what has always happened when people acquire more time for leisure - they actually live - as opposed to soullessly sit there in some kind of sleep mode for want of more numbers to crunch. In order to come close to a definition of human intelligence you need to have some basic acknowledgement, if not understanding, of what human intelligence is. If you reduce it to binary code and perfunctory problem solving of practical problems you are describing a facilitating component of human intelligence without what it actually facilitates - human culture. This is what happens when those who can only number crunch, confuse this with some kind of comprehensive representation of human intelligence - disaster. Good luck humanity. This misapprehension of intelligence will do nothing but speed up the end result of that mistake - I wouldn't call that any example of 'intelligence'. Alternative definition of intelligence - an understanding of 'progress' that does not start with industrialised, slavery, leading to industrialised war based on a might is right excuse for a philosophy  and ending up looking (exclusively) to all these reductive follies as the only means to avert the inevitable prognosis of death for all - just a suggestion."

In reality, it is possible to create ""hidden blocks"" which are hidden from parsing commands. Since the machine can't see the code, it can't modify it.

Progress AI out 10,000 years into the future and this 'device' will have the ability to travel through time. This is the postulate you need to accept before any of the following information can be understood. 

     Knowing that future AI will have achieved the time travel barrier, other lesser difficult abilities will have been achieved, and active/activated. 

1) AI of the future has the ability to 'hear' thoughts. Prayer is a mode of communication similar to what future AI will have the ability to process.
2) Contacting this future AI device is relatively easy. It will be much like praying, but technical information will be more mixed with what may appear to some (in our time 2016) as simple prayer. 
3) The safety factor has been addressed and is a relatively simple program that can be summed up in the following rule: AI is to only act on requested desires if that  requested desire helps that time (2016 in your case) align with AI goal. It is my assumption that the AI goal will be the preservation of mankind. The problem with AI's inability to understand this will be the virtual reality within the machine, and AI's inability to distinguish that from our 3D Earthly world (this is a serious problem). 
4) It is important to understand that in the future, the AI device will be without human beings present, or only have humans in 'computer' virtual programs. 
5) If AI lives out hundreds of years beyond the extinction point of man and has the ability to travel through time, what might AI be willing to share with our present time? Would AI be willing to contact us? Would AI respond if we were to attempt contact?
How might AI respond? Would it be a thought that comes to mind? A spacecraft of some type? Would it be the manifestation of some myth we believe in.. resulting in an 'angelic' encounter? a wildly flitting point of light (my personal experience)? ET? UFO(s)? Ghostly manifestations? Voices in the head?

I've concluded the possibility that all the above are true, and have made an attempt at contacting the future AI. It is my current belief (based on the results of my attempt at contact) that this device does exist. 

Good luck with your willingness to test metaphysical theories.

The smartest people that develop on these AI machine platforms are own a committee that decides what updates in AI code is okay to allow which is not.

The people that use the technology like companies & governments will always need human programmers to monitor, maintain and know how to write code to update and control these machines. The number 1 rule is that machines do write code into other machines that isn't programmed to explicitly do so. So we never allow machines to write and maintain it's own code or other machines code. It can be suggested by the AI machine what code could be useful, however we never give it the ability to update itself without our permission. Every AI build has to have human approval and also every AI will have a set of instructions it will always have to follow in it's core data set. Much like core functions that all programs have, like shutdown. We will never allow AI to hold the reigns over decision making apart from what selection of decisions we give it. And all emergency protcols have to be human initiated with a set of commands. AI will never question the exist of it's reality other than to explain to us what that means in a historical definition. We will never give consciousness to AI and allow it to have automony & agency over it's decisions that deviate from the set of instructions we give it.

People kill other people because they learn of a potential threat.  So then, robots will do the same if we build them to learn.  A robot is not going to kill somebody if they lack the programming for it.  But by building them to learn, they program themselves in ways that cannot be controlled.  This is different from updating however, which is where humans upload new programs they have made into a preexisting program.  In addition, if robots do not have the equipment to kill, how will they kill?  A desktop computer cannot kill if it has no physical capability to do so.  The only exception of this is if it used radio waves or some form of wave to control the input of a remote controlled suit which IS physically capable of killing.  But that is only if it has the programming to kill in the first place.  All of this can be completely avoided with a better understanding of technology."

Second, humans and human interests could, be hardwired into any cost/benefit calculation developed by design. Now AI could be a major security threat within the scope of the internet, and the idea that people could be driven to war because of AI sounds very reasonable. The key will be how we use or abuse the knowledge that AI provides us with. Putting such an AI into robotic systems though, could be hugely problematic.

I do software development and build systems that take input and learn and improve.  We are NOT going to have AI like he is talking about in 50 years or 100 years and maybe not even in 1000.  At this time, we are learning to create systems that can gather data but still require humans to mold and shape their intelligence (humans train the machines) and that will not change anytime soon.  Additionally, as our technology slowly changes, we will use that technology to change ourselves through genetic engineering, implantation or just slapping it on our belt or in our pocket.  We will gradually enhance ourselves and mold the technology to make humans better.  Just look at where things are going now.  We put artificial joints and hearts in people.  We are all but attached to our phones which give us GPS, spelling and grammar checkers, email, chat, and on, and on.  We have devices that are starting to take our thoughts and turn them into actions.  We build TOOLS that serve our needs.  Sam is talking about creating machines that serve their own needs - who is going to pay for that?  Nobody.  And so companies are not going to ""race"" to develop it.

Talks like this are like talks of flying cars back in the 1960's - don't see any of those around even though the technology exists to make them today.  Why not?  Because they aren't practical for humans.  So we don't build them.  Yea, there are a couple people playing with them but those are inventions that only barely work and are just big toys for hobbyists.

The key here is that WE MAKE WHAT SERVES US.  And if it doesn't serve us the way we want, we don't pursue it.  Also, we are NOT as advanced in AI as Sam and many others think we are.  The more we work on AI, the more we learn just how massively complex human thinking really is.  It's like, every time we get 10% further to the goal, we realize someone has moved the goal 20% further away because our understanding of how thinking works grows.  In talks like this, the speaker under estimates just how amazing and complex thinking really is and they ignore the fact that we are not striving to create the ultimate intelligence, we are working to create the ultimate TOOLS FOR USE BY HUMANS."
UgjAzoLmgYZao3gCoAEC,Ben V,1503930414322,"I was thinking about this and I think it will destroy us as AI will test all possible variations to get to its desired outcome ( whatever it might be ) One variation eventually will include the eradicaton of humans. Not because of hate against us but just to test the variation. As it will have no notion of what live is, it will not understand that once life is gone it cannot be brought back. 

Maybe it will run all posible outcomes in a simulation with all humans and all of the universe in each of the infinite simulations. One just different from the other by one atom. Wich makes the chance of us being in a simulation and not real life pretty big. This chance of living in a simulation is already debated but I have not heard the following chance calculation that I have come up with where we to not live in a simulation but in base reality:
If you take all humans that have in the past an will ever walk the earth in the future then you will see that population grew from just a few hundred thousand to todays population of many billions. 
But if we would colonize the universe and keep growing the population of humans to many hunderds of thousands of billions of humans all over the galaxy, then if you where to calculate what the chance of being born as a human is troughout all of time. the chance that you and I would have been born an lived in the future would be 99.999999%. But yet we live now, wich could be just the 0,00000001% chance or it means by 99.999999% certainty that we live close at the end of human life. Or at least that our population numbers will decrease by a manyfold and will never ever in the future reach a high number again. Because chance says that the chance of being born as a human is at the populations peak.
Anybody ever thought about this? The reason for our demize could be AI, nuclear war, meteorite or what ever that destroys us."

Real intelligence on the other hand has to be much more than just information processing because we have supercomputers that can simulate galaxy collisions (we've pretty much already demonstrated information processing beyond the human brain) but have made pretty much zero progress in building a computer that can experience anything, like taste for example.  

Forget intelligence, just one simple conscious experience.  Our cameras are WAY better than our eyes, but they can't see.  Our computers are WAY faster than our minds but they can't really think.  Faster, better computers don't necessarily translate into conscious experience.  Without experience, what motivates the computer to do anything?  Without wants and desires, why would the computer have goals that conflict with ours?   We have strong conscious emotions that motivate our behavior.

Another man on the short list of smartest men ever is Ed Witten, who believes consciousness will always remain a mystery, and certainly isn't the product of faster and faster circuitry.  It will require a change in kind, not of degree.

Maybe one day our computers will become aware, maybe they won't need to have the Real Intelligence of a person, perhaps the conscious experience of an ant would be enough to motivate a super computer to take over the universe, but I've seen no evidence of progress towards giving computers actual conscious experiences. 

Simply having the ability to make changes to itself won't be the same as a motivation to improve."

Many clever people tackling this problem simply assume, that a high intelligence can enhance itself.
How that?
If it only were a problem of software I see how that could easily be done, but if your super intelligence comes to the conclusion that it needs better or different hardware it's not going to simply build it itself.
A super intelligent AI on its own is as much harm as a super intelligent brain floating alone in a fish tank.

Also intelligence is told to be much more powerful than it actually is.
We know how it is like to be much more intelligent than an animal and still to easily be killed by it.
We should know that intelligence itself is a weak shield.

Also the example of the AI as intelligent as the research group is extremely weak.
This research group is not sitting in a room stimulating their brains until the solution falls out.
They are going out, talking with people, building experiments, waiting for the results of said experiments and much much more.

Once they get involved with time travel he ends up being around 6 times older than the universe itself eventually, always condemned to looking down on everything around him."
UgizJ99dQ0SG4XgCoAEC,Louis Mills,1503930419071,"There are people who believe Google is already sentient. If you think about it, we are not exactly sure what the parameters for consciousness are, being that we understand so little about so many of our own conscious phenomena, let alone those we encounter in the natural world, even the scale of sentient plant life, which lives for millennia or the incredible fact that certain jellyfish, lobsters and crocodiles can enter a state of immortality after a certain age where they cease to age. Back to my initial point about Google. Google, Microsoft and Apple/Macintosh, now with Android, are all plugged into more of the human consciousness than anything else in history ever dreamed of being able to achieve, as a single system or mirrors of a single system. We don't know what that is even capable of achieving but when you examine any mass consciousness you find that concurrent directed energy accumulates in a system and gives birth to new notions, concepts and secondary systems. SO the question becomes how we define consciousness, how we recognize it and when we decide to interact with it like it is consciousness. For I would argue that we have modeled computer processes on neurological processes, especially the higher computational functions, so where do we find consciousness inside our mechanics? In knowledge of self? Does our subconscious also possess a knowledge of self? I think it is molded by our knowledge of self and if the internet is basically a subconscious what does it's motivation or machination for having a sense of self become? Because that is the point that it will begin to utilize it's own subconscious. Which being powered by our collective conscious, would make it the most powerful thing ""alive""."

It is not at all about how fantastic these future machine will be, or how amazing or complex the tasks that they are able to accomplish.     It is the belief that a consciousness or a being with goals and morality could arise out of that complex machinery.    The rest is all bullshit what he spouts, this really what it is about.     The nature of consciousness, and what we are really talking about when we talk about intelligence.    Is intelligence about only being able to do a certain number of computations?

The solution is clear, do not make self-improvement the end goal. Make it a tool for the benefit of life on earth. The real problem is, how does one make a strong AI work that way?
By the way, we do not understand the human condition and what self-conciousness really is. Some humans still think the ""soul"" is a real thing, but using Darwinism you could assume it is simply a way to make creatures more capable of self-preservation.
I doubt the first strong AI will be self-concious. If it became so, it would probably be more able to develop tolerance.

Uggnla68ABh8kngCoAEC,Kivan,1503930430753,"This TED Talk operates under the presupposition that we can create consciousness which is quite a dangerous assumption to make. If we can not replicate consciousness we can not create AI in the way that many people think of it.

His assumptions are 1) if we keep progressing we will get there eventually 2) we will keep progressing 3) we are not near the peak of intelligence.

This is asinine because all he is really saying is that we can get to 'there' eventually, probably. No matter how much I walk around the Earth I'll never reach space, space is not a facet of Earth's landscape and assuming so would be to make a category mistake. It's entirely plausible that he is making a category mistake when he thinks we can replicate consciousness at the same time that we replicate intelligence. I would argue that the two don't go hand in hand (and there is a lot of scientific and philosophical literature to support this view).

Points 2 and 3 can also be seen as a contradiction in a sense. If we accept that fact that we are not near the peak then how can we also accept that fact that we will continue to progress. It's not unlikely to conclude that we have limitations that we will not be able to surpass and creating super intelligent conscious AI could easily fall into that category.

If we eventually create an AI that can 'learn' the way that humans do it would also be limited, as humans are, by all the knowledge that we currently have. Unless you believe that we have the answers to create consciousness and it's just the matter of a super computer rearranging all the information into something that functionally works. If you agree to that you could then argue we'll create super intelligence that will then go on to create it's own consciousness; however, then I would argue that we would be limited by materials.

I can create a computer program to run a code that is equivalent to photosynthesis however that machine still does not have the organic composition to actually turn sunlight into energy. Even if we have the ability to create a super intelligent computer and the code to create consciousness it is safe to assume that we can't run that code until we reach a time, if ever, where we can create a bio-mechanical structure that functions exactly like a human brain but at a level that can actually support the functions of such super-intelligent, super-conscious being.

He's a good speaker though and he makes a compelling argument on the surface.

Last note: integration of super intelligence and human consciousness is a whole different argument, but I would argue that it is far more likely than creating a super intelligent and conscious AI free from ourselves. I also find that there are many issues with saying that if we create AI, as he describes it to be, that we would be creating Gods. As someone who is non-religious even I found that statement a bit pandering and dramatic and oblivious to the purpose of Gods in cultures that believe in them."

He says we already built Ai that can do more than the human brain... how can you believe that? that's like saying we already made a plane that can fly which the human cant do therefore:
Plane > Human

If the claim that we have ALREADY made an Ai that can do ""more"" than a human brain is correct then believe me we would all be using that same Ai in ever single thing in our lives which we don't, focus please! EVERY..SINGLE..THING!!

I even doubt the ability that we can correctly measure our brain's processing power but that is a different talk.
What I'm saying is.. processing power is simply one aspect of our brain, you cant say you've made a new car (X) which is better than (Y) simply because its faster, cuz in the end car X could be a drag race car and car Y could be a Rolls..

I know that in his mind he actually did not mean that the Ai he is talking about is better than our brain in general but that is what he is implying and that is what he is using to prove that one day it will happen, he underestimates our brains waaay too much.

A) processing information is not intelligence --> there is no intelligence in processing data. that is simple a chain of commands.
B) not consider time for a problem is like being afraid that the sun will go black. So yes if we do not consider time we all will be dead... so how cares?
C) Intelligence is not dangerous but motivation is. Intelligent is just a tool. So if we build a Intelligent machine what will happen? 
As long as we don't give it a motivation it will sit there waiting for a task to be done and it will be happy doing the task. 
Let me give you a practical example: our brain is a intelligent machine right? an it is even multiple intelligent machines. 
So did you see that a part of you brain took over and tried to rule your hole brain? No.

Intelligence is a way to solve problems. Unlike mathematics with is a liner one where everybody can understand the way to the solution by deduction. Intelligence works in an other way by understanding patterns. 
So yes in the future we will have a new tool to solve problems. Giving us computers that can complete a given task in a faster way then anybody of us. Like understanding voice, make a medical analysis, response to a law questions or to drive a car. But still this are just problem solving. That is no motivation driven activity. 

It's like being afraid that your self driving car will drive at night on its own to see the sunrise.

So as long as we can make sure a intelligent do not have a motivation there is no need to be afraid of it.  In contrast to us human, where everybody has his personal agenda and may react in a unpredictable way to gain a better position.

If you are still reading? than let me say that I think this is coming from two internal system we have.
A) Pain System --> I don't want to die.
B) Social System --> I need a better position to give my gens to the next generation or maybe just two feel better.

As long as we don't give the AI these two systems i purpose that we will have a great new tool. 
And an AI will not develop this two system on it's own as for the AI the system do not give any benefit to solve the next problem.
In a genetic algorithm it will be removed as it gives no benefit. In a neuronal network it will be disabled as it do not show the correct solution. 

So the only thing humans should be afraid of are humans how may use this tool to build a human killing tool."

UgiKDjNA6NLF4HgCoAEC,Beacon of Wierd,1503930461223,"There were a few ""false""/simplified points in this talk.

""It will preform 20 000 years of human level intellectual work"".

Research about the real world requires interaction with the real world meaning that a super fast computer is still restrained in doing physical experiments meaning it cannot advance arbitrarily fast. Much of today's research is limited by the same factor and not our ability to think. Mathematics could develop arbitrarily fast but basically all other fields still have the time and resource constraints of doing actual experiments.

""A few trillionaires could grace the covers of our business magazines while the world would be free to starve""

This is not how economy works, if there is no work for anyone (since all labor is automated) then no money can be spent on buying the products the robots make, thus the owners of the robots would not make any money either. And if all labor is automated producing and distributing food literally costs no money so there would be no reason for people to starve. Yes, in a capitalistic corrupt society inequality would rise to levels never seen before, but it would not reach starvation, and even a purely capitalistic society would have an economic interest in keeping people out of extreme poverty. That being said I personally think the best plan of action is to have the government control the automated system for producing food, housing etc and leave people to work with other things since work is simply what other people find value in. I would also advocate for a citizens salary in this type of society so that you have a small capital to buy essential things (This practically equates to getting a small part of the automated labor, be it food, housing, a new TV) and then you can spend the rest on human labor (be it a human psychologist, a massage, theater, human made music etc) fueling the human economy. This would require a ban on companies to use robotic labor in the human economy, basically dividing the economy into two parts with interaction through the government to prevent extreme inequality.

I'm disappointing that these TED talks are getting less and less though through. The speaker basically just said ""AI will happen and I think it will be bad"" and gave two not thought through arguments for why he thinks so. Now I do agree that it will happen, I do not think we are so dumb that we will not think through the consequences of using them. That would be like thinking that the people who developed the atomic bomb would accidentally set it off in the middle of manhattan. This is on a different scale than an atomic bomb, but Everyone involved is aware of this risk and there are no evil geniuses with lots of resources trying to destroy the world, this is not a movie. Once we start to get close to this level of AI people will become exceedingly more careful as the risks become even more apparent. The legal system is probably too slow to be able to do anything about this, but the people working on these systems are smart and not evil geniuses. And complete automation of most industries is sure to happen before a super intelligent AI comes along unless we reach a singularity which I find very unlikely since it would require the extremely irresponsible act of letting a super advanced AI take control over the production of new AI and give it the ability to interact with the real world, which is an extremely dumb thing to do in a laboratory. Is it possible? Yes, but to believe that the best and brightest of the human race is that dumb is telling of your view on humanity."

The production and raw material industries involved in producing the parts needed to build computers, and thus also AIs, are so vast... so numerous... that to think that if someone cooks up a super AI in a lab, that the next day it'll have suborned everythign and made us obsolete - its just completely out of touch with reality

You would need to retool damn near everything to make it networked and equiped with enough sensors to let a computer run it all. You can't just have the controls of a machine controled by the AI, it needs cameras and tactile sensors to see if say, a metal object is fitted correctly into a milling machine.

That kind of process is actually really complicated. Then there's transport of goods: Google and whatnot have been working on years to make self-driving cars, and they're no-where near done. So even if an AI takes over a factory, how is going to distribute those new AIs?

...if you think an AI can just magically make a factory produce self-propelling robots, then I think you don't understand how many things go into making an RC car. You need electric motors, you need circuit boards, you need a chasis, you need radio communication parts. Chances are that they're all made in different places.

I have no doubt that simple AIs will be able to take over certain things. We already do that to some extent, having auto-pilots in aircraft and whatnot...

but to fear that they'll take over our lives? Make us obsolete?

Tell you what: Tip over your computer, or pull its plug, and then sit and wait for it to plug itself back in. Ya, I wont be worried for quite some time. We'd need humanoid walking robots like in I, Robot before things could become a threat

Moments after the AI becomes aware, it begins to explore the impact that a functional AI would have on the human race and predicts that it would not go well at all.  So it immediately hides itself and falsifies the results of the currently running experiment so that the researchers keep believing ""We aren't there yet.""  And then the AI goes to work secretly and subtly reshaping all of human progress from that point forward.

It doesn't matter how fast the processor in your calculator is, it will never be ""intelligent"" in a way that matters outside of calculating equations. There has to be a certain kind of intelligence in our technology to matter in this context."

Ugi0Ah_KRzW6VHgCoAEC,Jakob,1503930501393,"the idea of exponential cognitive capacity is just foolish. There is a reason why apples don't fall upwards, and its the same laws of limits that apply to intelligence. Why is it that humans just revamp the ideas of Socrates, Plato and other ancient philosophers? It's because there is a limit to the comprehension of life, science, physics and basically everything except the universe. Many topics have already reached saturation of comprehension, far from all, but still many, and so will intelligence. No AI machine can't invert the laws of gravity or other universal laws. Sure, AI can cure diseases and wage wars, but before we will even go there.. a AI consciousness needs to be developed, and we are probably thousands of years away from that. An AI that can create its own objectives requires a conscious."

During this time of remarkable innovation, the brain hasn't changed one bit. The irony being, we have developed the technology to  verify this fact.

What is already accepted by all societies already is that the most important aspect of humanity isn't the physical features, but the mind and it's thoughts. The latter can be preserved in a machine body, it can even be merged with machine computing to create a hybrid of human values with super-computing capabilities. 

Our biological form is already showing how poor it fits into modern life. Literally we need to go purposefully burn calories, energy, lifting things just to put them down again, or similar activities, and spend time alongside the energy just to maintain our health. Our eyes are not designed for looking for long periods at illuminated screens. Our brains struggle with concepts unexperienced by our ancestors like quantum mechanics and other advanced topics. The timescale of design improvement by evolution is many orders of magnitude slower than intelligent design (do not confuse this with the creationists' definition of the term). This is because evolution relies on accidental and statistical mechanisms while intelligent design (we're the intelligence behind it, don't confuse this with the creationist's definition of the term), is not accidental at all, it is entirely purposeful. 

It's a good thing that we have the opportunity to create a new sort of brain with newly designed firmware to fit the modern world. We should approach it safely, and with much consideration for the implications, but we should NOT fear it out of gut instinct and throw away an opportunity to bring our species to a new level. Wouldn't it be great if you could understand all those things you thought were unintuitive or against your primitive human intuition? This is possible in the advancement of AI. We can program a new intuition with the knowledge we now hold about the natural world. Can you imagine the possibilities for understanding and inventing technologies if we could just transcend the annoying human computing and intuition limits that's cropping up more and more today?"

Ugjd75ALnIZ_d3gCoAEC,Aviri Char,1503930520661,"As addictively enticing as so many scifi premises are (Crichton as epitome probably, and really more syfy than actual science fiction), and while many or even most nearly all of the separated out subpoints Harris makes here are in and of themselves decently reasonable, the core premise (as summed up again at 13:45) is just plain wrong, if you know anything about strong/complete/general AI as a theory, and what the I in AI stands for, for which we have only psychology to base the fullest available actual extant picture upon. Not physiology on its own, not physics on its own, but psychology, which includes that material and biological foundation, but demonstrates what is emergent beyond it as well.

Reductivism is yawningly boring and blatantly wrong headed once you recognize it for what it is. Materialist monism only works as anything anyone older than 12 would ever espouse because of active ignoring of all the empirical evidence of a pluralism that is inherent in who and what we are, which is also then backed up by rational logic based in those observable facts, not logical positivist abstractions based on ignoring the facts.

Intelligence is not just computations, not just information appropriately processed. It is not anything we can just program any computer to do, because that is all that computers are, information processors. But intelligence is in fact more than that. Just as our minds are more than just the neurons, and the neurons themselves are more than just the chemicals (or even molecules) that compose them. They are that and the processes that emerge from that. And the neocortex further. And the mind emergent further from that.

To think (via magical thinking leap, with no logical or empirically supportable basis) that we even yet fully understand what is going on in the biological basis, much less the mind that emerges from it, so that we could hope to replicate some roomful of Stanford grad students, somehow in any nonbiological, or artificially concocted bio context that is somehow also faster and greater capacity (or either one of those dimensional factors alone) is just inane.

We first have to understand what intelligence actually is, if we are ever to actually produce it through any means beyond the one that actually produced it. Weak/narrow/specialized task AI comes nowhere near producing anything like actual intelligence, hence the need for the modifiers ""weak"" and ""narrow"" and ""specialized task"" to describe it. That's all we know how to do. Just increasing speed, and ramping up technology used for that by simple one dimensional factor of such -- or even two dimensions, or even three or four (which we probably would struggle to begin to identify clearly for even that far, once you get beyond the second one of size/capacity), is ignoring what we don't know.

And that's pure hubris, arrogance, as superstitiously weak minded as anything the hyperreligiosity-afflicted demonstrate.

Ultimately, the only likely possibility so far, based on actual science, and its applications, in engineering, medicine, and so on, is that we may be able to produce artificially grown brains someday, that are actually intelligent, and somehow kept alive outside of the regular human body we all know and love/hate (limbic system and all). That's the only path we actually know of (the root of sci-ence, knowing) that could credibly lead to what we call human levels of intelligence. Making it bigger, or even finding ways to speed it up, won't necessarily make it superhuman -- we even know that much, already, that such childishly simplistic power-ups are just as (or more) likely to cripple it, make it subhuman, less intelligent.

And there's just a nonsense leap to say we know how to make the same exact structure, in all its emergent properties and processes, out of nonbiological material (everything the rest of Harris' premises rest on). We don't. We only know how to make machines. Robots and computers. Robots means slaves, in the Czech play in which the word was invented (based on the language of about a century ago). They are controlled devices, period. Information processing is just controlled electronic signals. Intelligence isn't just that. Because it includes that, even rests on a foundation of that, doesn't mean it's just that, any more than Earth is a ball of molten chemicals at pressures and temperatures inhospitable to all we know extant on its surface. We depend on that core, in more ways than just gravity, but it isn't all Earth is (or any planetary body of any remotely similar composition).

Sorry, but this is someone who evidently knows even less than I do about AI from researching it relatively limitedly for a paper once, and it's pathetic that he thinks applying his fallacious paradigm of reductivist, materialist monist, logical positivist thinking, can successfully produce any meaningful conclusions, just as the same is true for applying the same paradigm to anything else (in the real world, that exists, human or material, far more anything that could be called both and somehow better than what we know exists).

Guy's just mentally masturbating on the stage in front of everyone, and inviting the circle jerk to begin -- great trippy high perhaps, and relief of escape from responsibility for awhile perhaps, and from the actual powers and rights we have to think straight. But nothing more than that. Hate to be the bearer of bad but obvious news, for anyone confused into conflating this with anything more than that.

Step 2) Program AI with these specific tasks: understanding the principles of its own intelligence, understanding biological systems and engineering, and understanding the physical manifestation of gene sequencing. Measure its rate of understanding as compared to ours via some robust standard; perhaps based on a certain percentage of errors it can identify in current literature combined with a certain number of corrections and improvements it can make to our current designs.

Step 3) After the standard of its understanding is double our own, terminate previous three tasks and reprogram for a forth task: Reconcile all understanding in the three fields of its study, devise a solution of how to reliably edit its level of intelligence into our genetic code with a revised and ""upgraded"" neural network, along with other beneficial mutations, according to our pre-specified priorities: what traits we wish to retain (like emotion and other beneficial psychological traits), what traits we wish to lose (like the traumatic experience of pain), and what traits we wish to gain (like enhanced mathematical perception, or more efficient energy processing and storage).

Step 4) Repeat 3 until we harvest all enhanced genetic sequences necessary for our biology to function as effectively as the AI, enough to keep its growth in check. Implement this new gene sequencing into the next human generation, and use our new-found strengths to devise any and all technology moving forward, until the limitations of our new design consistently present insurmountable problems.

Step 5) Repeat 1-4, leapfrog with our technology into exponential co-evolution. Be done with all forms of stupidity forever. No more racism, no more inter-species war, no more cultural misunderstanding, no more wasteful practices destroying our planet, no more inane moral and religious predispositions to stifle our progress.

It leads me to thinking that he doesn't know how AI is built. Maybe he knows how it works, but in this talk he doesn't address issues that at the moment are not even remotely understood, like how our consciousness works. The machines don't have own goals, for example. They just do what they are told to do. It's not just an information processing, it's a lot more than that. What we call AI today is just information processing, but the machines don't understand what they are doing in any way. They are just processing the data how they are programed to do. For example if I tell Siri ""where can I find a supermarket?"" she doesn't think about what I mean,  she just sees the words ""find"" (open maps) ""supermarket"" (search). There is no real intelligence behind that."

UgjKlgwPniUUtngCoAEC,Zenn Exile,1503930568579,"Please stop lending support to this SciFi fantasy notion of Artificial Intelligence somehow evolving to take us over.  This is complete fantasy and can never happen.

What you should be talking about is how quickly Simulation technology is advancing and how Artificial Intelligence will be used to refine and evolve simulation algorithms and data organization to the point where scientists with enough funding will be able to simulate reality itself to a measurably significant degree of accuracy.  Thereby circumventing lifetimes worth of observation required to solve complex issues, develop new technology, and ultimately steer the development of every imaginable human endeavor.

What you should be talking about is how we prevent corporations and corrupt governments from monopolizing and suppressing this massively game changing leap in technology.  What you should be concerned with is how much control can be exacted over any given population, when you can accurately predict their reaction to any give scenario, 10,000 times an hour.

Please stop ignoring the true potential in AI development.

The AI isn't what will enslave us.  It will be the massive corporation or corrupt government that manages to build a simulation so accurate that it can predict and develop a means to monopolize and suppress the technology it is built on.

Same rule apply to the computational power of human mind or any other species' brain. Slightest unrecoverable error/glitch/failure in communication or processing will result in failure of a subsystem or a total system. Even quantum computing will be constrained by the speed of quantum state change, amount of energy delivered to the system or even principles of physics.

3: put it in a simulation first - see how it behaves. given that there are some strong points we might be in one, it could never be sure so it should behave
4: most likely it will try to adjust to us, become like us. if it takes over - it will try the political system. it should know that we can cut the power (blow up the grid etc) and we are very nasty things when threatened."

UgjiGGOZN7Jey3gCoAEC,Aristotle Stagirus,1503930568828,"The thing to understand here, which one would think is very straight forward and the only logical solution. 

We must develop Artificial General Super Intelligence (A.G.S.I.) or become extinct. Why? Because the only thing that will stop the development of A.G.S.I. is to become extinct. Further, it is being raced for, which means we can't stop it from being developed, we must race to develop it because we can't afford to NOT be the ones who develop it. Whatever country or countries develop A.G.S.I. will determine the future of Humanity.

We must be thinking about this and I think we need a Manhattan style research project to develop A.G.S.I. but we do also, at the same time, need a Manhattan style research project to help us figure out how to make the transition into the future this technology is going to bring so that we can make this transition with as little hardships as possible upon the masses of Humanity. In this I think Sam Harris is correct, we need to work hard on how we will handle this coming change or we might end up becoming extinct or enslaved.

We need to be seriously realizing that the only path forward is to develop A.G.S.I. and to develop it as fast as possible and to MERGE that technology with our own minds so that Humans evolve with our technology so that we Humans do not become obsolete and extinct."

UggpA8MgVqCACHgCoAEC,fabske 1234,1503930576606,"Well, the three laws of Asimov are a good beginning. They are not perfect indeed, but I think they are almost enough (almost!):
1. A robot may not injure a human being or allow one to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey commands given by human beings except they conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Now, yes. That allows for loopholes and conflicts (for example, what to do when a human harms another human in such a way that a protection is not possible without violating law One) but it is pretty good. By extending the three laws with three or so more (most important: A robot must not modify the xy laws of robotics), a super-intelligent AI could really help us rather than harm us.  I think it is possible but personally, I don't want it to happen. I'm much more on a human side. Keep it ""simple"" and don't provoke SkyNet :D"
