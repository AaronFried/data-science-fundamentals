Cameron Russell displayed a very deep insight into a person's worth. She is honest, she has benefited from her unique position and she is humble to analyze this in a way few do. She never said looks didn't matter, in fact she said the opposite. She just added a grain of salt that most don't ever want to hear. That life is never about a single specific thing. And it is flawed way of thinking that if you had that one thing, you would make it finally in life forever. So cherish what you have. Life is never fair, we all dealt a different bag of circumstances when we are born. Improving anything you want is also great. Just don't be naive thinking that everything will be great when you achieve something. Happiness has way more to do with the journey than the destination."

Guess what if you watch more she says at 2:27 ""And I am on this stage because I am a model, I am on this stage because I am a pretty white woman."" She CLEARLY ADMITS to being given certain possibilities based off her looks, making her privileged and people acting like she said, ""I am hear solely because of my hard work and skills, no one gave me anything growing up, I had no advantages"" SMH. 

She GIVES EXAMPLES of what she was given as a result of being an attractive model,
6:33 ""But, the free stuff that I get, is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free.""

6:45 ""When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over. And all it took was a ""Sorry, officer"" and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are."" Right after that, she goes on to talk about how some people are paying a cost for how they look: ""I live in New York and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked, 86% of them were Black and Latino, and most of them were young men.""

This is what she said at the end of the speech: 8:30 ""So, when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike a honest balance because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out her and say ""Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor"" and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with ""and it doesn't always make me happy"". But, mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression, when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries...... If there is a take away from this talk, I hope is that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceive failures. Thank You""

So, if you ACTUALLY WATCHED THE VIDEO, you would see that she's saying the looks have power over our lives. All the people who trying to ridicule her as if she said that ""look don't have any power in our lives"" probably saw the title, got triggered SMH, didn't even watch the video or attempt to listen to what she is saying in the video because of the title and formed an opinion not by what she ACTUALLY SAID but, by the title of the video. UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.

Plus, the phrase ""looks aren't everything"" is true, your looks don't completely determine your life or truly represent what or who you are.

Weren't you guys taught in school, ""Don't judge a book by its cover""? Maybe you weren't but, whether you were taught that or not, don't judge a video by it's title and thumbnail PERIOD."

UgzaAKe2gqO5u2tNCxt4AaABAg,Peter Gambier,1534256651106,"Having talked to different  models about their jobs the one observation that I took away was that it was a tedious boring job with a lot of sitting around and long periods of boredom as well as a very high likelihood that you might end up with a drug or health problem brought about because you have been told that you are too fat, too pale or too nervous and you take drugs illegal or otherwise to help you with these issues. Some of the worst of these have to be cocaine, alcohol or slimming tablets where there is a high likelihood of becoming too dependent on them.
Even worse would be the effect on your sense of well being being told because you think that you are too ugly, too fat , too short or too tall. This is all such bollox because beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and what may be sexy/beautiful/pretty to one person will be so different to so many others. 
Being confident and comfortable in yourself is all that matters and being a model has such a short lifespan because you are considered too old at 30 which s superficial tosh.
Most of the models I  ever met were pretty vague, vain and superficial, they thought that the world turned around them, especially the male models I knew.
I met all these models when I lived in Munich, southern Germany and the standard of beauty was very high in this country when compared with the US or the UK where many women  have either too much make-up, are too plain or just  pasty-faced and fat, and in the western world these conditions are only set to rise and rise."

I know I should be grateful but I have trust issues, I know that some of them were treating me like that only because of the way I look. The old me would never get treated this way. 
And those boys, who wouldn't even spare me a glance back in school, they look stupid when they think they can have me now.

First, I wish she had spoken a little longer and gone into depth.
Second, Like everything in life, your blessing can be a curse. 
I have experience with being treated differently because people perceive you to be beautiful or attractive. I applaud this woman because a ""good looking"", ""attractive"", ""beautiful"" person speaking about the cons of being attractive is basically taboo. ""How dare she complain or talk about the dark side of beauty!? What an ungrateful privileged woman!"" When really, there is a dark side to being beautiful. 
Yes, it is nice to have a cop let you go or to have someone open a door for you or buy you a drink, or invite you to cool places, etc. With that privilege, you also get people who follow you and stare at you and make sexual comments towards you and try to touch you inappropriately. You get cops who let you go, but not without first being a pervert. You have no privacy because people constantly watch everything you do in public. People will buy you a drink and invite you places, not because you have an awesome personality, but because they want a beautiful person around to make them look cool or feel special. You are constantly assumed to be an airhead with no intelligence or wit or personality, and when you express those qualities people compliment you like you are a cat that knows how to pee on a toilet because apparently, it is so rare to be good looking AND have some wit about you. You never know who truly cares about you, or who just wants to exploit you and get into your pants (this is with all genders). When it comes to workplace atmosphere, people often envy you and sabotage you or once again, try to make sexual advances. When you are young you are being sexualized by adults and your body becomes something that feels it needs to be hidden even amongst family members, school teachers, bus drivers, construction workers... 
So yes, being beautiful got you a fancy dress, compliments, an open door to anywhere you want to go, but it also came, detailed in the fine print, that you will never feel safe and loved for who you truly are because you are like an object to most people. You are something to have around because you shine. But as we know, beautiful things tarnish. 
Think of Hedy Lamarr, a Beautiful, intelligent, driven and resilient woman who struggled all of her life to get her ideas and inventions taken seriously, but couldn't get past the image of being a beautiful woman to people. People can really be very shallow and no matter how intelligent a beautiful person is, often time people just want them to shut up and be their beautiful pet.
Being beautiful does not excuse someone from life's ups and downs and problems. being beautiful does not automatically mean you will have a beautiful life. Beautiful people are shamed, made fun of and experience life all the same as everyone else. we all have our unique challenges and it's time we stop pasting this illusionary and unrealistic image upon people we find attractive. It is not real, it is not healthy and it is damaging to not only ""Average looking"" people and ""Attractive looking"" people all the same. 
At the end of the day we are all just trying to survive with the blessings and the curses we are born with. You cannot invalidate anothers experience simply because you have not experienced it or because it seems silly to you. I mean, really, how superficial and self-involved is it to think that someone good looking doesn't have difficulties in life?? That's the movies kids, and the movies, we know, are not real.

People want to be your friend automatically, people treat you nice automatically, that first pass it a free pass. But the thing is... I'm also a weird girl. I have mental health issues and disorders, I have strange interests and I don't always act ""right"". So beyond that first pass, things are not free. Everyone wants to be my friend until they meet me . Everyone lets me off easy until they realize I have nothing beyond looks to offer that they want. And suddenly these ""nice people"" don't want to be involved with me any longer, don't want the mark of ever being involved, so they get mean fast. People give me the chance to be friends (which more than ugly people get I know), but after its all me. And it's one thing to know that if they would give you a chance they would like you. It's another to know that everything they don't like about you? Is you. 

You learn pretty quick not to trust nice people as a pretty girl because you pay interest on that ""free pass."" And I've figured out some people don't care that I'm a person, they just want my body to use as they like. And maybe I still have the privilege.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being endowed with characteristics that make a person more attractive to the majority of people on the planet.

The ''hairstylists, make-up artists, photographers, all their assistants, pre-producers and post-producers'' are akin to the scouts, the managers, the coaches, the trainers, and all the assistants that make an NBA player, the interviewers, the management who selects, the sales trainers, the mentors, and the team leaders that make a sales person, and the college admission board, the tutors, the tutoring assistants, the interviewers, the medical boards, the hospitals, the physician and surgeon mentors that make a cardiac surgeon.

Most professionals are not self-produced.

They wanted to see a picture and while I was trying to find one on my phone they started all talking about how much looks matters in dating and all that. They asked me what I thought and I said 'No, I dont think so. You get used to what a person looks like after awhile and its the intellect and personality that will keep you interested' About that time I found my pictures of my gf at the time whos honestly a blond bombshell. We werent just dating. We were buddies, too. So the way I looked at her changed drastically from the night I met her and was just floored by her looks to that time when she had become my best friend. So I handed my phone to these teenage girls and they spent the rest of the dinner teasing me about how 'looks dont matter' and called me a total hypocrite for saying that and dating a woman that hot."

The mindset that people have upon beauty and race has deeper roots than the influence of the fashion industry. And people who have the advantage over this certain perspective(usually white) seem to be the most reasonable group to be subjected to the accusation of racism... It speaks so loud so we often ignore the fact that a good amount of us(non-white) have the same guilty desire to imitate what we're not made to be. And it doesn't always have to be racism. same thing goes with if you're not tall, basketball might not be a great choice of career for you unless you have much better hop and speed than those who are taller.

""Oh you must have hit every branch on the ugly tree.""  Perhaps.  =)  But for me at least, I seem to find the women who are introspective and humble incredibly sexy.   You will be naturally attracted to healthy, creative women.  Sexual beauty is just a genetic advertisement---  Should you be watching advertisements or figuring this out on your own?  This love thing?  I mean, how can you just make love to someone simply from a visual perspective?  It reminds me of that scene in Demolition Man when Stallone's character rejects the virtual lovemaking they do in that dystopian future.  Yes, you may want to say to me right now, ,"" its just the attraction in the beginning, its just the spark to get the fire going right?!""  Well that fire is raging out of control thanks to 'Kim Kardashianism'!  Or whatever you want to call that deification of empty headed beautiful women that is pervasive in our culture.  Which is fostered by Capitalism; still the greatest pimp of women only second to men themselves.

Society beholding hoi polloi instantly creates a vision of her. A vision that portrays all but what she is. She showed us a series of her model  pictures, compared to a real-life picture taken very recently before the photoshoot, and proceeds to ensure that the sexy, seducing, white girl working the sunglasses is not her. But merely a vision that so many professional hairstylists, photographers,  makeup artists worked to achieve. In person, Cameron comes off as being a very down to earth, intelligent, and kind woman. Not to mention her  bravery for speaking against such a massive industry that she partakes in. And those traits are beautiful within themselves. People are missing the fact that the person models are manipulated to achieve, are not the true person that they actually are. And therefore, no, looks are not everything. It is what lyes within."

Having more choices and opportunities will probably (in the long run) mean that you end up happier and more fulfilled than those with less choices and opportunities.

So er...... Yeah. Looks aren't everything in themselves but they may very well play quite a large part in you being able to get everything you desire.

Find me the beautiful person who DIDN'T literally exploit their looks in order to forge a career to give this talk and I may find it within myself to admire them for what they're saying rather than what they DID in their past.

It's easy to renounce your former life of living off your looks once you've made a healthy financial start for yourself and created those choices and opportunities I was talking about earlier."

Sure there are a handful of people who are too naturally ugly to be helped, or so naturally beautiful that they don't have to put in the work. But the vast majority of us are in this middle ground where we can be potentially ugly or potentially beautiful depending on how much effort we put in to our appearance. Being good at fashion, skincare, hair, makeup, working out... these are all skills, habits you can develop. So when someone is shunned for being ugly, they're not being shunned because nature gave them the short end of the stick, they're being shunned because they're too lazy to take care of their bodies."

Anyway, for those who are arguing that only the rich say ""money isn't everything"" and the pretty say ""beauty isn't everything"" allow me to show you another perspective of understanding this statement. Money is important. The rich obviously have it easier in this world. Also, money would definitely solve many problems for a poor person and make them happier. 

However, for that rich person, he has already achieved the ""wealthy"" status but that does not necessarily mean that all will be right for him in this world. I don't think life or the universe usually goes like ""Hmm, this guy is rich so let's make sure we make life super simple for him."" No. Life will still throw issues to him the same way as a poor person or anyone else! 

Especially for the issues that even money wont really solve, such as depression or self-hate or those issues that really needs you to disregard external factors and really look into yourself. I know that a poor person going through such inner issues may have it worse.. but its not like the rich person can throw money at his internal issues to make them go away. And still if this poor person were to somehow become rich, that wont solve his inner issues. So this rich person will probably be like ""Money isnt everything."" And I agree"

UgymcFeMdcNtamDkxyB4AaABAg,Terrania Korra,1532787897701,"Thinking about this as well, the reason I do not agree with this ""looks aren't everything"" speech is that those of us who aren't so good looking are insecure about our looks and those who are very good looking are also insecure about their looks. But insecurity about our looks is not the only problem we face in life. We also face the uncertainty of wondering, while if we will have money to survive and if the pointless struggle of trying to climb up the ladder of wealth will ever amount to anything, we face questions about whether we will find the perfect match for us in life, we face the problem of we will get that job or not when hundreds or even thousands of other people have applied for the same one, and countless other problems. The thing about what this model is saying while still making money off her looks, means she has many of these problems handled already while the rest of us have to face the majority . You see, to me, the insecurity about looks mean nothing because its something most people face anyway, but there are things that this girl gets to avoid because she looks beautiful and that's why I can't take her message seriously. Sure she has good intentions at heart but when you say that we shouldn't be getting ahead because of the way we look yet you yourself are directly benefiting of the way you look, makes your message seem less real."
UgwRAwYCBjKTs1xPgD54AaABAg,Terrania Korra,1532787897708,"I think models are insecure about body image because of the competition. They see other models who they or others might consider more beautiful than themselves and begin to feel more insecure because there are so many people who, in their eyes, look better. The reason I think this is because I feel the same way but in a different aspect and i'm sure others do also. You see, I am a 19 year old college senior with an AA degree taking a Biomedical science major and I feel insecure about my intelligence because the program is so competitive. If you aren't at the top of your class, your chances of getting into a great graduate school or med school seem pretty slim.

The perception that others have of a person doesn't rely just on their physical appereance, but also on how do they behave.

A first impression is based on physical appeareance and a long therm impression is based on behaviour.

The second one (long term impression) weights the most. As ""x person"" could be the prettiest person on the world but if their behaviour isn't ""*appropiate""/ the right one, in a long term, they won't be seen as such.

( i don't think that the word ""*appropiate"" is the best choice for the message I was trying to convey, but is close)"

UgwD_ypxPnK_jA1Fyjd4AaABAg,Maddy Thenappan,1530195914891,"Being beautiful has its major downsides. Looks don‚Äôt last, you‚Äôre at your most beautiful through your 20s and then early 30s, and then your superficial outward beauty begins to fade. What happens then? When you‚Äôve only ever navigated through this world for how pretty you are, you‚Äôve been conditioned to value yourself through a highly sexualized, ‚Äòothers‚Äô view. when you‚Äôre not young and hot anymore, you begin to feel like you‚Äôre not worth as much, and are left a little broken, I‚Äôm sure. Marilyn Monroe killed herself, and is a good example of this, in its extremes. When you‚Äôre not constantly valued for your looks, you learn to navigate through life with the things that matter - your personality, smarts, sense of humour, values, and your work on these things more too. Average looking women are probably happier in the long run, worked for what they have without their looks influencing too highly, married to someone that loved them for all of the things they are, both outside and inside, not just because of how beautiful they were when they were in their prime, and have learnt to find a place in the world that‚Äôs theirs not just in the first 30-40 years for the remaining 30-40 too. Being successful and male is when life treats you best - men are valued for more than looks they‚Äôre valued for typical ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô qualities like leadership, wealth, charm. This usually lasts longer and can be accumulated through time. Men also have the stronger downsides though, like she‚Äôs mentioned in the video, where a lack of those things meaning a much harder life than a woman. Life is unfair kids, the sooner you figure this out the better you prepare yourselves for it."

1) White girls are there, because they are the prettiest. Yes, everybody can be pretty, everyone is special and so on... but not everyone can be model (including me). So deal with it. Don't get down to the level of some feminists, who want fat women to be models and to give orders for others, who they have to like and how many of them have to be in model industry.
2) Black drivers are stopped? If you pick some numbers out of context, you are just another type of liar. Isn't there some correlation between race and chance he committed some crime/offence? If so, where is the problem? Are black people more likely to be shot? Do black people commit the same percent of crime, which they represent in society? I don't want to get numbers from someone, who is avoiding basic facts.
Speaking of New York and when she is very hot, how about RAPE? Only 22% of population are black people, but they represent 49% of rape suspects!!! White people are only 11% of them. And other crimes (murder etc.) show similar outcomes. So why they can't be stopping people of some race, where is double, triple,... chance they encounter criminal? People of color are much likely to be criminals ... and what police should do? Should they control higher number of innocent people, just because someone can be offended by some statistics?"

Ugzqa2gXF-vk3NIQXMx4AaABAg,Saby Orhean,1530195924681,"I don't get why people are getting so butthurt about what she has said. She was honest and humble, and she is aware of what the model industry is like. The main thing I don't get is why people are angry that good looking people have an easy life. First of all you DON'T get to choose they way you look because it's genetics, secondly the way images are made is fore making people feeling INSECURE, and that's how this fashion industry works. Beauty may be something that is in partly hidden in the way you look, but mostly it's about your IDEAS and personality. Why do I say that? Because physical beauty is truly most of the times misleading. Sometimes you get to know people that look hella good and then they open their mouth and it's like death has suddenly come to talk to you. Other times you are meeting average looking people or maybe bad looking people and they have the most likeable handsome personality. And you know what? I would choose the ones with good personality always over good looking arrogant rude people. This girl here truly has the whole package because she is smart and cute. So it doesn't make sense pointing at her like she is the problem because honestly, the main problem here is how WE perceive ourselves and if we are confident in our skin. The problem here is that everyone has forgotten about the fact that this sort beauty is made up by SOCIETY, and it's making everyone of you being angry at the wrong people. You should be angry that someone tries to define beauty for you instead! You should be angry because no one gets to choose what you define beautiful besides of YOURSELF, you should understand that accepting someone's beauty is NOT making you LESS BEAUTIFUL. I don't like bragging about myself, I used to have all these kind of behaviors where I would pick someone to give the blame for the way I looked. You know what? I can still feel beautiful and appreciate somebody elses beauty, I can decide what's beautiful for ME. And I can understand that PHYSICAL BEAUTY is truly SUPERFICIAL because at some point youth will fade and I will become non attractive. People will chose to stay with me because of my personality traits, because maybe I'm kind, maybe I'm caring, I'm fun to be around etc... My looks don't stop me from working hard, aspiring to things, having interests, having a family, having good friends, having a good life. You don't even try to look at it from a different perspective! You don't even care. Why would you, the only thing people nowadays look at are themselves. Have you ever thought that most good looking people are insicure because most of the people treat them like the don't have a mind of their own, like they don't have the right to feel sad, like they don't have ideas, that they can't be smart? How many women have been ignored as potentially good for a place of work because people think they aren't enough smart because of their looks? Come on people, it's freaking 2018 and you are still behaving like this? No offense, but it's so disappointing reading these comments! And don't you think these models are ethereal presences because they are not. They are HUMAN beings with flaws just like everybody else. They tell you to reach up to some standards that are non existent and unbearable, and most of you still give the blame to models and accept this instead of finding your own way of percieving things. And that surely it's not the blame of this light hearted woman here. IT'S YOURS."

I‚Äôve never seen that. But the truth is, looks may not be everything to her since she has it but to the rest of the 99% of the population, it does mean a lot; and it literally is everything. It‚Äôs like a rich person saying money isn‚Äôt everything. To them it isn‚Äôt because they have it, but to everyone it literally is everything. It‚Äôs all subjective to each persons point in life, so making blanking statements doesn‚Äôt work, especially when it comes to beauty as beauty is such a huge role in everyone‚Äôs lives. It dictates how they feel about themselves everyday. 
It‚Äôs a fact that the more attractive you are, the more opportunity you have in life. So I appreciate her talk, and it was interesting how she said models are the most insecure. I never thought of it that way since I figured they were secure in their beauty. But it makes sense if they have to judge their appearance everyday just to make a living."

UgwbRXxWGTvMagoLJ5J4AaABAg,MidnightCanvas,1527517534149,"What she's saying is so true tho, I started studying fashion photography since last year, and there are so many factors to a photoshoot that make up the photo you see on magazines and online. There's so many factors on it, like they drink a lot of liquid and very little solid food for a week before the shoot to make their skin tighten more  to their muscles. They go through a vigorous workout that takes up 3 hours of their every day at least not counting their very restricted diet. This is on top of their good genes already, sometimes genetically chosen genes. Not counting the consulting of diet, exercise, make up, face wash routine, what you wear everyday, everything fitted for just that person. Not to mention the steps of pre planning, photoshoots and post production? God that is a lot of work man. 
There's a reason why modelling is a job, it is such hard work, it just batters your inside so much, insecurities and constructions all heightened. You might look beautiful on the outside and you might be enjoying luxurious life styles, but most can't completely let go and go crazy and do whatever they want."

Believe Me,  I'm Ugly"", we would either applaud them or scoff saying, ""You don't know what it's like to have beauty,  how would you know if it's better or not?"" This woman is clearly trying to explain that the only reason is considered ""beautiful"" is because society has defined her as such.  In twenty years from now,  that definition will change again as it has in the past. Therefore,  looks really aren't everything. Furthermore in our current society, it is actually far more about how presentable we are,  how do we socialize, do we have sociable personalities?  Those are what work in the long run.  Looks have some leeway but if your personality is rude,  that automatically will shut people off.  Sure they may act nice around you,  but in the long run,  they won't be there when you need them most.  So yes looks aren't everything because,  honestly what are ""looks"" anyways?

Looks matter very much, but they are not everything. I think I'm a decent looking guy. Acknowledging this gives me a lot confidence and it clearly helps making people like me from the start along with other benefits, and I do recognize the advantage. When making lasting friendships and accomplices though, looks matter little. Or when trying to be actually competent in any skill.

But I would give anything I have to be beautiful. Like, anything*. I can't stress the *anything strongly enough. I've tried to find fulfillment a bazillion ways. Volunteer, travel, get involved in the arts, meditate and do yoga. Some of those things, I've tried multiple times, only to feel absolutely empty no matter what I achieved, whom I helped, or what I saw.

None of that can change your appearance. I mean, you can be the universe's gift to whatever, you can be a light in someone else's life, you can literally sail the seas -- and having to look in the mirror and be extremely uncomfortable with what you see. 

I am here to tell you that that extreme discomfort is by far the worst thing I have ever felt in my life. Worse than the sum total of eight schools during K-12. Worse than my parents' divorce. Worse than three sexual assaults. Worse than all of those put together.

Everyone‚Äôs set of traits comes with its own pros and cons‚Äîbeauty is a positive trait to have but doesn‚Äôt necessarily guarantee success or happiness, and can even work against other characteristics you want like intelligence and wisdom. There are plenty of beautiful people who are shallow and unhappy, and plenty of people who aren‚Äôt conventionally attractive but extremely content and successful. We all find our place in this world based on our natural talents, attributes, and skills, so to pretend that beauty is the only great advantage a human can have is completely misguided.

I say this as a former cheerleader for whom appearance used to be a huge ‚Äîthough not the top‚Äîpriority. I work at a tech company now, and no one could care less what you look like. They care about your resilience, organizational skills, health, and job performance. It reminded me once again that no one cares how pretty you are if your insides are trash.

Ugzr4s3nO_JlXbdJG-J4AaABAg,Ryan M,1519827973039,"Hating on someone who is physically beautiful is no different than insulting or ignoring someone unattractive. The point is neither of them had any say in the matter so why would you use that to form an opinion on their merits.   If you have an issue with your looks or hers, voice your complaints to God. 

The truth is that as humans, we don‚Äôt choose what we find physically attractive. It is instinctive. It‚Äôs natural and conclusive within a split second. Society doesn‚Äôt tell us what we naturally feel. Society presents to us what is widely considered attractive by most people. Humans can be manipulated in many ways, but saying we can be mindfucked into being instinctively attracted to someone is a myth. 

And yes it‚Äôs true that over time when we get to know someone well their virtues become what we find attractive in spite of their looks being what we are not attracted to. Many can get past that. I cannot unfortunately  And just like my attractions are done without thought, so is my inability to have an intimate relationship with a woman if no physical attraction exists. 

If more people would acknowledge truth, and determine a persons merits only on what is within that persons control, we would be so much better odd."

UgyydIID1sbgY2bpZSd4AaABAg,Fuller Ming,1517149579207,"Ms. Russell back in October of 2017 used her Instagram account to expose sexual assault, misconduct, and abuse in the modeling industry.  It is related to what she spoke about in this TED talk. I hope and pray this woman figures out the truth ‚Äì she is definitely on the path and I‚Äôm confident, if she does, will be able to have a powerful influence for good in the world.
     The ‚Äúgenetic lottery‚Äù she won is really not based on her looks.  This is actually a flaw in her thinking.  The lottery she is ‚Äúcashing in on‚Äù is the brokenness of mankind.  There is nothing wrong with being beautiful.  It is not, in-and-of-itself, superficial.  How we react to beauty can be very much superficial!
     The ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù she speaks of is the real problem, not her physical appearance.  The FACT that 53% of 13-year-old girls and 78% of 17-year-old girls don‚Äôt like their bodies is a reflection of this legacy.  We value modeling (and similar professions) more so than other professions.  Her example career paths of ‚ÄúPresident of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet‚Äù implies this.  Professions that are significant and should be valued are not nearly as honored, valued, nor well paid as models, athletes, musicians, or actors.  For example, my wife is a high-school teacher and although our society DOES honor this profession, somewhat, it is not honored or valued financially nor with social capital, like modeling, acting, or professional athletics.
     The problem, the ""legacy"", is the human condition.  This is not going to change.  I am not a pessimist; I‚Äôm actually an optimistic person, but human nature is broken, fallen - if you will.  We want money, looks, we want to be accepted and liked, we want power, pleasure, and the like.  We seek such things as ‚Äúlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness‚Äù at almost any cost - individualized of course.  When out of control or unchecked, we call these things greed, selfishness, and lust.  And if honest, we all struggle and some just give in. 
     Ms. Russell‚Äôs ‚Äúcashing in‚Äù on the legacy is just another aspect of the legacy.  If people didn‚Äôt OVERLY reward others based on physical beauty, there would be no ‚Äúcashing in‚Äù like she explains.  Oh, we would still need models and they would be paid, but it wouldn‚Äôt be what she has experienced, the abuse she shared over Instagram wouldn‚Äôt occur as much, and young girls wouldn‚Äôt struggle as much with not liking their bodies. (Note the song by Jonny Diaz entitled, ‚ÄúMore Beautiful You‚Äù)
     The ONLY solution is metaphysical.  On individual bases, we must change and become people of character, integrity, and we must develop godly values.   But the ultimate solution is found in two Aramaic words:  maran√¢ th√¢'.  These words, in their transliterated Koine Greek form, are found in 1 Corinthians 16:22.  Until the ultimate solution occurs, we must each grow and develop as individual people, so that we control our more base, ugly but very human impulses.  This is true for models as well as the rest of us.

Which was at over 8% in 2016, which is getting close to representative for their percentage of the population. As far as the stop and frisk thing goes, many black and latino lives were saved by stop and frisk because 96% of shooting victims and 97% of shooting suspects are black or latino.

In a world, where all people are awakened and mindful about themselves, others and life itself, looks wouldn't matter at all. Then all people would know, that we are way more than our bodies and clothes.
However, we are NOT living in such kind of world. As a matter of fact, we never did. Even if someone tells you , that he or she is not influenced by someone's physical appearence, it's a lie. How often have you dated people, who doesen't fit your ideal?
And if you did, maybe you just hadn't any other options. Many of us are influenced by looks and appearence unconsciously. It happens so fast, that most of us are not even able to recognize it consciously. To be exact: It happens in a quarter of a second. 
Now, for a person, who looks like Cameron, it's simply not possible to tell, whether looks matter or not. You can only do this, if you are someone, who doesn't appear to be pretty in the eyes of society. Someone who doesn't represent the current ideal. 
She will never be able to feel and understand what it's like to not attract attention easily and not  to stand out. As far as I know, she grew up in a pretty good environment. Her parents are both entrepreneurs and she had never to struggle financially. 
On top of that, she was obviously very lucky in winning good genetics. 
Now tell this story to someone, who is neither physically a feast for the eyes nor lives in such priviliged surroundings. Those guys will always have to work harder and longer. Period. They will tell you, that in most societies looks do matter. 
Sorry Cameron. You tried your best, but this kind of speech is not something, that YOU should deliver. It's just not authentic."

So, if you are experiencing a level of distress around your eating/shape and/or body-image, and are interested in self-compassion meditation and you live in the UK, please take the time to check out the link below and decide if you would like to participate in this study!
The study will explore how practising self-compassion imagery meditation affects self-compassion, eating behaviours and mood.
If you would like to become more self-compassionate by trying out a free online therapy tool, participating in this study may be a good first step :) Please share with anyone you think may be interested :) Hopefully by participating in this study you would be getting something back, as well as giving something back, e.g. furthering research in this area :)

This skews the perception of how she became a model for lots of people in that you may think it was mainly her supposedly elite-level beauty and race that lead her to be ""discovered"". 

Her mother is a wealthy, powerful and well-connected woman who was one of the co-founders of ZipCar and an MIT alum.  She even gave a TED Talk.  Her mother also had a friend that worked in the Ford Modeling Agency to help Cameron get her foot in the door.  

Through her family's alumni status, wealth and connections, she was able to enjoy an ivy league education, after attending a prestigious private high school.  Cameron isn't the only one, you can look at several other model bios and find the same thing.  You could make an argument that coming from a wealthy well connected family was an even bigger factor than simply being white.

She's so used to focusing on beauty she does it without realizing her whole day makes her look the way she does. She says she got a fake tan before she said she's there for being a pretty white girl, a contradiction. She says people are attracted to tall slim figures, but men don't care about height and like curves. She's very attractive despite being a tall, slim( androgynous ) body type.

Let me tell you a story

So, there was this really attractive girl, I never really talked to her, cause she was kinda reserved but on the other hand really physically attractive. So time passes by and we became ""friends"" and I was hoping for more. I couldn't give myself a ""push"" and talk to her about that, cause I thought that I wasn't good enough and she could have had anyone. I regret this till this day, 2 years later. We both moved to a different country, I have never seen her since. But I was being told (1 year ago) that she felt the same thing for me, which was probably the weirdest feeling that I've ever had. You knew on the other hand that she liked you but on the other side you knew, that you completely messed it up. Why am I telling you this story? Cause we both had problems with our self-esteem and that was the only thing between a relationship. If you're ever in this situation, talk to her/him, you're good enough.

That suggest women far more influenced by money  and are far more superficial. Align that with the amount of money they spend on things like cosmetics they are shallower too.

In actuality some studies showed these to be true, indirectly. Cos of their need for security and family the study said, so they selfishy think of that future whereas men generally think of tomorrow on a good day. :D

Ugz6gQr5tbmTho4DF6R4AaABAg,Macchiato2398,1506608851309,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but beauty truly isn't a recipe for happiness. Some people have internalized society's garbage so deeply that they actually believe improving their ""shell"" will magically improve their life. So what if being pretty means getting ""free stuff"" and having certain advantages? Does being pretty guarantee that no one will ever bully you or hate you? Even if you recieve attention from guys/girls for said beauty, does it mean every romantic relationship you enter will be a success? That you'll never suffer a rejection or a breakup? Does being pretty mean that you'll never get sick? Does it mean you can't die? Does beauty transform you into a magical Pegasus bestowed with the gift of immortality? Does beauty mean that at your funeral, long after your youth has left, your obituary will be painted with beautiful words about your impact on society? If the answer to these questions is yes, by all means model your values around physical looks. If not, learn what inner work means so you can find your TRUE self. I'm not saying these things to invalidate feelings of insecurity about being considered ""ugly"" by society. I'm only asking you to reassess what really matters to you, and challenge society's recycled trash mantra about beauty being everything. Because if you don't, if you choose to internalize all the crap that media has shoved at you about how to look/dress, I guarantee you, not only will society continue to suffer as girls use beauty standards to punish each other, but you as an individual will never be happy. And that unhappiness will have nothing to do with your looks.

Rant over."

Even though most girls can make themselves beautiful, (yes, even quote 'ugly' ones) with makeup, the right clothes, and/or surgery, you can't be truly beautiful without inward beauty, just like you can't be truly ugly with inward beauty. It's a very hard thing for girls (including myself) to find self-worth without outward beauty, though, so this is a great reminder that they (you!) don't need to be perfect! And if men won't respect women just because of their looks, then I say they are lost and don't deserve the woman, even if they're handsome and the woman isn't. Inward is waay more important than outward - we just forget it sometimes. So remember, don't judge someone by their looks - looks are fleeting, and will (naturally) fade with time (to an extent), but inward beauty can last forever.
And in case someone was going to say I said that to justify myself being ugly, I'll have you know I'm not ugly - I'm just not perfect. No one is. You cannot have the perfect looks for every person on Earth. Period. Exclamation mark."

Being pretty is a two edged sword because I instinctively assume (until proven differently) that a hot woman got where she is in part because she's hot. Of course being hot doesn't equal happiness. True happiness comes from having lots of followers on Instagram and Facebook. As for race thing, perhaps you should teach elementary school in an urban area like I did. There you might observe that children who come from stable families, whether those children are white, black, brown, orange or green, are more likely to find academic success, more likely to be well behaved and more likely to be on a path that leads to a promising future rather than incarceration. Is it generally harder being anything but white? YES! Then again, if you want your small business to have a good shot at getting government contracts or contracts with Fortune 500 (that have to feed work to minorities) you want to be anything other than white male ownership. Don't blame guys for the bone thin models. Guys don't buy Vogue. Females do. All things being equal, a guy doesn't want to be with a bone thin female. With think boobs are a good thing."

Someone here compared it to being rich, which also isn't the key to happiness but it can make it easier - It's upon the person to use it correctly.
And that's the crux in this whole discussion here: What does correctly mean, or: What does happiness mean for her/for us?
If being happy for her just meant finding the right guy and living a stable life, I'd say that would be no problem for her - Whether she's insecure or not.
For some of us happiness just means to be accepted in the society. She can't consider those thoughts, because she never faced them.

So she is right about her talk and everyone has his/her own problems and insecurities but there are different levels and that's why some people here are disappointed etc by the talk."

Lets analyze the word shortly:
Make Up. So this implies its something you put over your face, you make it up.
So a good looking girl is mostly skinny (can be trained, made with fitness) and lots of make up, which is also unnatural to begin with. 
People that think of themself as beautiful, will spend a great deal in mantaining that image and are in constant need to be admired in some kind of fashion.(obvious and non obvious)
People that think that looks are important suffer in reality, because their emotions and feelings are connected to the idea what others think of you.And with age it gets even more terrible, because oh look, your body is aging and dying, how terrible.
Well, i hope you can see that looking pretty isnt important at all. If you think you need to look pretty to get the man or woman you always wanted to finally get kids and be happy, you are delusional anyway. Cheers."

They had family, but their partners did not and could not fulfill their fantasies so they paid to live their dream. Once they did, they realized it was a momentary dream. Out of reach, impossible to fulfill expectation, so to overcome their frustration of unfulfilled fantasy they social engineered and imposed it on their ignorant subjects to control and profit from them. Today as it has been for many centuries most are insecure frustrated unfulfilled consumers, because they taken leave of their senses. They remove natural oil of body evolved over millions of years by detergent and then replace it with artificially created rubbish because it sell as age barrier.

UgiRAgGaPiInt3gCoAEC,Frugi Viking,1503930525903,"Beauty means different things to different people. It's subjective, or as they say, in the eyes of the beholder. To some people beauty is a certain type of figure, and a symmetrical face painted with makeup, to the point where they look more like a doll than a human being. To me beauty is in the soul and expression thereof. Beauty is being brave enough to be yourself, and to look deep inside to figure out who yourself really is. Beauty is an open mind. Beauty is the ability to resolve conflict without taking to violence. Beauty is intelligence. So what I'm saying is, to me it's not about looks. Even so I have some idea of what I think looks beautiful too. Or rather just what I prefer to look at. Because that is what it is, a preference. True beauty, I believe, goes beyond human comprehension, and beyond the preferences of the ego."

How does one win the genetic lottery, acknowledge the benefits, dismiss the benefits, claim the benefits aren't worth worrying about, ask to not be worshipped, acknowledge the only reason for the platform was the worship, willingly be sexualized, hate sexualization, and still find a rational or relevant reason to open the discussion?

Ugj39ifkcOH-yXgCoAEC,Big L,1503930596557,"The key fallacy here is the presumption that there's inherent virtue in being unattractive, or that sacrificing kindness or smarts is a necessity to being attractive and rich. Those girls you ask Cameron, they realize that while being smart and kind is important, there are unique advantages to being rich or attractive. Advantages you not only seem to take for granted - but also refer to like a curse - all while continuing your career as a super model. Like it or not, that IS hypocritical."
UgitLvH5rB3IFXgCoAEC,Big L,1503930596568,"So make yourself ugly. People who aren't good looking don't believe it's the end-all solution to all lives' problems. But this is like hearing from someone that's been a millionaire all her life that ""money isn't everything"" - honestly, you really have zero idea unless you've been without so why even pretend you do.

So many girls I've met have the biggest hearts, are generous and smart, but struggle to find and keep guys just because they don't have the looks. You might say ""well then that guy is no good anyway"" but reality is not that simple -- it hurts anyway, and looks matter a lot even for good guys. 

Point remains, that someone attractive can become ugly as soon as they want, whereas someone unattractive can't just wave a magic wand and become hot. That's why the former in any case is preferrable to the latter, and this talk just comes across as arrogant and whiny."

3: Any man (skin colour irrelevant) with bad teeth
4: Fat men (body fat percentage 50%+)
5: Men that doesn't look trained (work out less than 6 hours a week, powerlifters and off-season bodybuilders)
6: Bodybuilders (Roid rage will put you equal to men with facial tattoos)
7: Men that work out between 6 and 14 hours a week, but have decent muscle definition
8: Fat, bitchy and stupid women
9: Overbearing women
10: Fat women

Her changing clothes went to people stop paying attention to her clothes to actually listening to what she was saying and when she showed her normal pictures against her professional photos it meant that the professional picture portrayed what society wanted or craved but it was not who she really is thus many models are insecure because they cannot be who they really are in public because they must live up to everyone's standard. Example: They will freak out more over the possibility of looking a bit heavier in a picture or having a bad hair day than the average person because their career and self esteem depends mainly based on that (on looks).

The benefits you get from modelling outweigh those of an average 9-5 job (where you don't get to travel, you don't get free clothing, you don't get paid much, you work long hours and do repetitive tasks, work with the same old people, in a grey cubicle). She says that she feels that people judge her based on her looks, and focus less on her values and personality; yet, this could be said for an uglier person. Everyone is judged based on looks (pretty or not), it's unconscious bias. I'm not pretty, I've been judged based on my looks - they say I look introverted, not friendly, socially awkward, all because I'm lanky, not bright-faced, frizzy hair etc. They don't care that I'm actually genuinely friendly and outgoing.
I'd rather have her struggles than that of an ugly person because while a lot are similar, you actually get some sort of benefit from being pretty.
That part she said about modelling as a young girl; those uncomfortable poses etc. You had the choice, and you pursued modelling. You can change career paths, despite what you said about how unappealing 'underwear model for 10 years' on a resume seems, there are many models who have moved on successfully! Miranda Kerr has her own business now; And if it weren't for her 'fame', her business would not have been nearly as successful.

UgimsThATNfqYHgCoAEC,x y,1503930668727,"I think humans are generally very high achievers when it comes to happiness. 

We seek happiness and satisfaction especially in trying to achieve things we don't have yet. And once we have achieved it, it doesn't satisfy us to do the same thing again. We can go and find happiness in something else. You can pick up the guitar and try to learn it. You become a legend at it one day and suddenly it bores you. It doesn't satisfy you anymore. You move on. To another instrument and repeat the same thing. 

'Looks aren't everything' is so subjective honestly. Take that and apply it to the way we look. The people who are already good looking because of the genetic lottery are not satisfied anymore by their looks and it doesn't make them happy. They seek happiness in other things. To these people their own looks aren't everything. 

People who don't have good genes may have achieved other things that don't make them happy anymore. But they want to be beautiful. In their head they will never be happy until they think they're good looking. Looks are everything to them.  

One thing about being good looking is the benefits you receive in life. The attention, probably more positive behaviour from others. This can really upset you if you're treated less because of your looks. It damages your confidence. 

The effects of thinking you're ugly are terrible.  It truly is in your head.  Looks aren't everything but a damage of confidence can prove to counter your social life drastically. You could become distracted, obsessive. It gets in the way of your life and your relationships. How many opportunities will you miss? 'She/he probably won't want to date me, I'm ugly' have you ever though that? That's damaged confidence from low self esteem. You ever been shopping and not even tried on an article of clothing because 'I probably don't pull it off'? You ever stood next to a friend and thought it's better if you just stood under their shadow?

You really won't REALISE how important your looks are unless you're on the side where you feel insecure about it a lot. You don't feel this side and that's why looks aren't everything. It's subjective. Looks can be everything and can not mean it as well"

It's a blessing to have what you have. Everybody should embrace how they are and acknowledge their flaws, but at the same time try to improve whatever they can IF they want to.

And she talked about how images can be superficial and how having good looks doesn't make you always happy... Her struggle is that she doesn't think looks should have such big control on our lives but she is precisely the biggest beneficiary of this whole phenomenon so it is kind of an awkward situation. I feel like this talk doesn't have one very clear message, but it somehow left a strong impression on me after watching it like a year ago.

UgghfJGiHW81pngCoAEC,doinksauce,1503930673832,"I see redundant comments about ""looks isn't everything but it sure helps a lot"". If we just cut out all BS and consider the appearance struggles in society, a person's look is a type of resource in society of social context it's unequally and unfairly distributed amongst us, that is part of human life. The truth is that everyone is not free from visual judgement, even being a pretty girl has its great disadvantage for the individual; people will remember and use her for the looks regardless of whatever else she has, it's a card that she must play or else she will be viewed as stupid, weird, unrealistic, etc. in society. One can compare good looks with being wealthy, except there's no foundation as she mentioned in the video, it's a wealth of happiness that will never be long lasting which is we end up seeking in life."

And it isn't. The image obsession is all misogynistic talk but you can't put everything in one box. One can learn a lot in the modeling, fashion world. It can be art, it can be real, powerful, engaging, rewarding, beautiful, extraordinary, unique. It can all about money or not. I'd say 99% of the people have conflictive feelings about how they look and that will change throughout life, and that's okay. No one should feel guilty because they are beautiful, stunning or white, for that matter. Sounds like she's apologizing for being who she is because of the wrongs that other people and society has done. If that dress and high heels make her feel happy, if she enjoys eating them, if she does it because it's something she feels good in, if no one os forcing her to, then the problem is with those who are judging her and not the image she portrays!"

Social and psychological studies have shown some significant disadvantages of being ""attractive"", such as the ""insecurity"" she talks about and a delay in developing a sense of self-confidence and self-worthiness. Having other people eagerly trying to please you constantly takes away more then it gives when it comes to personal development. It takes away many opportunities to cultivate self discovery, sense of purpose, sympathy for others, setting boundaries, etc. I suppose it's kind of like being treated as a wealthy person. You can't escape the tendency to be surrounded by those with their own agenda to get something from you."

This is just a small point in a very long chain of indicators that there is a clear divide between our true selves and the part of us that is governed by our material existence. Every which way you turn, you will find that your material existence comes into conflict with your true self (consciousness, spirit or whatever obscure label you choose to use). You will find that despite Belinda Carlisle's catchy appeal, heaven actually isn't a place on earth.

What I'm getting at is that it would be beneficial to keep the two spheres separated intellectually, because they don't really go together. They're like oil and water and trying to mix them generates nothing but confusion. For example, you may know in your heart that our selection processes are superficial, but despite your conviction you will be helpless in overcoming them, even personally. I think you should absolutely fight for a better world. But once you realize and accept that there are boundaries there that cannot be dissolved, everything will make a lot more sense."

On the flip side of that, if I met a super attractive girl, but she didn't have a very nice personality, I probably wouldn't want to hang out with her. I will admit, looks aren't EVERYTHING, but they do play a damn large role. Now I do believe that if you love someone's personality enough, then over time you will find them more and more attractive. 
However, even if someone is damn hot, that doesn't always guarantee them a date. I, myself, would be considered a good looking man. I have a strong jawline, nice hair, blue eyes, and well toned skin. However, I have no idea how to get girls to be any more than just friends with me. I'm super awkward, and fairly wacky. I also don't have a lot of experience with girls.

Ughlwn7qYbIv3ngCoAEC,Kevlin soatrome,1503930765653,"Mmmm I don't know man. I didn't find her to be that good looking. Insecurity is unattractive. She looks fairly good, but in the end it has to do with taking care of your looks. Anyone can look good at that point. Rly. Lack of belief is a big part of it all. She really believes in how she looks and have gotten approval for it due to her career. 

Perception is reality. I'm sure you've heard that one before. If you perceive that you are good looking, you will start acting how a good looking person acts, and you will begin to be percieved as being good looking. It's actually pretty simple. What is not so simple however, is how our communication works. You should know that only around 20 % of our communication is verbal - what we say. The rest comes down to first and foremost, body language and there after, tonality. This is how we communicate good looks. Especially as guys, but also as girls. 

Of course there are also some natural factors to the whole thing, but you can definitely be good looking, no matter what. I bet some of you reading this will have some doubts and I only have one thing to say to that. That is your problem. Your doubt creates uncertainty, which in turn will create unnatural movement patterns and a whole bunch of unattractive communication. Therefore people perceive you as unnattractive. Beauty is a wonderful thing if you know how to create it."

It's synthetic and it's intentional the way we're being hypnotized by image. Excuse my French, but it's all bullshit, and I don't know exactly how Cameron is helping. What I got from this video is that she is super lucky (for winning the modeling lottery), that her type of beauty draws the most attention (which is not true), and that if someone is ashamed of what they're doing they might as well continue doing it because it pays so well. This model is inadvertently pushing the artificial agenda of making the masses believe that physical appearance is everything. Wake up people, it's not. That is a lie based on ideologies and philosophies created by vacuous, rich, powerful people.

Men treat them so much better than they would treat an unattractive woman or a man, so the world is simply a much nicer place as everyone is nicer.

1). She doesn't look beautiful to me. Honestly. Her natural touched up self looks nothing like the untouched self. 
2). She didn't mention that she was born into a wealthy family. They had connections to a modeling agency and signed her up.  
3). She doesn't look completely white to me. 
4). After her modeling career she has a wealthy family to fall back on. Most models end up broke or become a millionaire's trophy wives. 
5). The modeling industry is controlled by gay men, that's why so many female models look like men with long hair.  
6). She didn't talk about the rampant drug use among the models to cover the terrifying rate of sexual abuse in the industry.  
7). But, i applaud her for seeing and speaking up about the problems she did notice. Good on her for that."

Also y doses she assume she got the dress for free because she was pretty and not because she was young and they felt sorry for her. She's talked about how lucky she is because she is pretty and has generalised that to all pretty girls. If she really has none of the horrible drawbacks to being pretty then she is lucky not because she is pretty but because she doesn't get the horrible crap from ppl which comes from being pretty. I was hoping to hear about how much crap pretty girls get but I heard none, just the repeated and false mantra that if you are a pretty white person you have one the lottery.

2) && there's a difference between being happy and being grateful. You don't have to be both, and that can apply to popularity and money the most. Popularity and money can't make a person entirely happy or entirely satisfied, its physically and mentally not enough.
3) Looks are deceiving. She's saying people's actions towards others are dependent on looks when it shouldn't be. That's what a majority of society is like, we can't help it overnight. She's pretty, and people are nicer to her. But she could also be the rudest person in the world, and some wouldn't care. 
4) Another woman's beauty is not the absence of your own.

She felt she is the wrong candidate to point out the injustice of our society whilst she is on the benefiting end but I relate to some degree about political systems and societal associations. We didn't create the systems and perhaps if we had more authority, we'd change them. However, if not then, we will still be admitting of our making the most of what the world is. Like everyone else. Doesn't mean we are ignorant. We are just surviving too."

He has potentially done everything money related that he could fit on his bucket list.. What do you do once you've done all the things you've ever wanted too do? What is there too look forward too in life? Now he's acting up, getting more depressed, only a matter of time before he acts up again.. Many celebs do this.. money also takes away trust it's hard too find a partner, Although justin has good looks. It's going to be extremely hard for him too find a girlfriend that he loves, for the long hall. They most likely have to be rich too. This is why SO many rich celebrities become addicted too drugs.

Yes model's are messed up, but so is every other people on the planet with a profession or without a profession... thin or fat... black or white... You made a million bucks with those campaigns, but others didn't. You are well off than others because of the career choices you have made. Talking against that is just plain disrespectful to your own life :/

PS: I am a photographer and value all models as people not as mannequins. But if a model calls herself a ""pro"" she should be able to deliver all the things a model can deliver. Or else she just gets pushed back the line.. like any other profession."

It wasn't until I encountered amnesia I stopped and realized I needed to do what I've always loved doing. I needed to become a writer. 

I applaud you, Cameron, for coming out and explaining your emotions to clarify that modeling doesn't mean your way is paved for you the rest of your life. When I see the entertainers of my era, who have undergone failed plastic surgery in hopes of hanging onto their physical image it saddens me.

Why? It seems logical to assume the opinions of the people who thrive in these subjects are more often 'correct' compared to the opinions of the people who don't thrive in these subjects. Some 'beautiful' people tell you this so you can save your time and go do other productive things. They have been there and have seen the light. They are only telling you that the light is not as bright as you think it is, and that the hue is not what you imagine it might be. I think these people have every right to say these things since they take the delusions out of the delusional. I don't know about you, but I'm certainly not tired of doctors speaking of health, authors speaking of literature, or the beautiful speaking of beauty.

As an only child, automatically think! Spoiled Brat! Not the case. My parents both worked, had to work, due to the fact that they supported  2 of theyre disabled parents. I did receive an allowance..very small.Well any way. I was not a lazy kid either. So I would do what I could to make a buck, raking leaves, delivering newspapers etc. But any how I had found the greatest, cheapest thrift store there ever was. I would go in there and look for Designer Labels, which were the same price as Walmart. Anyway I was so picked on for being an only child with the great clothes. Also when you are an only child, friends are important, I did not see color, or looks, or how poor any one was, so then my Mom started getting phone calls from her alleged friends, as to what is your kid doing with this one or that one. I really went through a lot, all of my school days, all for being an only child, who only did what I thought I was supposed to do. But in the end, it all made me a great person, and nothing has changed as how I look at people, even as an adult."

I think that it is powerful that she mentioned how being a model reinforces society's idea that the images that you see in the magazines of women looking sexy,  posing seductively, having  Eurocentric or ""white"" features, is how all women should look like, and that you need to have that kind of beauty in order to feel accepted and worthy in society. But the funny thing is, these images in the magazine are constructed, airbrushed, and SUPERFICIAL! Not to mention, it reinforces racial inequality, and the fact that there are so many women from different ethnic backgrounds that are not represented in the magazines that we see today, particularly women of color and other non-white ethnicities. As a white woman, Cameron is being honest and owns up to the fact that she was or is a part of that contribution to racial inequality and construction of Eurocentric beauty as more valuable and desired. She is socially conscious and aware of the implications that this has on our society. Why young girls, black and white have body issues and low self-esteem? Why a non-white person is more likely to get stopped by police on the streets? Been socially conscious is more powerful and owning up to the privileges of been a white female in society! Can we all start to be socially conscious and own up?"

Anyone her who thinks that being pretty and having money is enough to create happiness need to get informed."
Ugg5pS2i9H3XongCoAEC,velkoon,1472394907505,"I didn't like this too much. She tried too hard to come to ""our level"" and perhaps appease our jealousy by showing pictures of her as ""normal-looking."" Well, the fact is, you're beautiful on that stage right now and do not look too far off from those ""so unrealistic"" modeling photos you were presenting. Also, when challenging the idea of growing up to be a model, she gave very odd examples of what one could be instead. She said she was pretty enough to be a model (""genetic lottery"", ""[white] legacy""), and so that's why she became a model. So it should go for anyone else, right? She should just outright say, ""If you're white and super-pretty, go for it!"" But like she said, she's in a very difficult position and it's hard to find a balance between discussing her obvious benefits of her looks and talking of insecurities..could easily lead to people detecting hypocrisy...which a lot of people are claiming.

UgiWS6_z_5ef63gCoAEC,John Moser,1472394917785,"We're biologically programmed to react to tall, slender figures.  Human females narrow their waists when ovulating (the muscles and blood flow change) and when they're aroused; their lips expand and become deeper in color.

I do not understand why women are naturally attracted to darker men and men are naturally attracted to lighter women.  It doesn't make biological sense, yet it transcends across cultures.  The biological basis for seeing darker-skinned individuals as threatening is easily understood, but that doesn't have anything to do with attraction; and a cultural basis shouldn't exist in all cultures.

She's right, though:  Physical appearance gives you an edge.  You can mess with your facial expression to make humans universally see you as trustworthy; but your facial bone structure determines their evaluation of your competence.  Being a tall, regally-jawed male makes you the most intelligent man in the room, automatically.  I don't know why that happens, either."

She thinks all of the good things that come to her are because of her hard work and intelligence,  when it's really just her striking beauty.  Sometimes it's fun to be with her because you can also benefit vicariously from her good fortune, but most of the time it's frustrating because you realize that it's fleeting.

Billions of dollars are spent on advertising to manipulate us into buying stuff. Two of the most effective techniques is to either create associations that trigger desire (such as planting in our subconcious the idea that drinking lots of Coke would surround you with impossibly perfect people who think you are the coolest person ever) or to make us feel really dissatisfied with ourselves - so we'll buy products we hope will make us look ""better"".

Ever noticed how the very same companies that sell creams to give you ""golden, glowing skin"" in North America and Europe sell very similar products, but with opposite effect, in markets where most people already have golden skin? It turns out if you turn manipulation into a science - which is what modern consumer marketing is! - you can convince everyone that the way they look is not desireable, and sell them a ton of stuff.

On a deep level, what can Russell enjoy about her work? She is not contributing in a meaningful way to society, she is not helping, she is not redistributing wealth. Instead she is merely perpetuating a cycle that deems superficial traits to be the most important currency.

Russell is part of the problem I'm afraid. To those saying good for her in speaking about it. I would say good for her in coming to this realisation in a society that teaches you that fame, wealth, and looks are tickets to happiness. But having come to this realisation, I think speaking about it in this rather muted fashion and then going back to live under the rock she is condemning is frankly, her doing the bare minimum. It's like somebody saying 'Child labour is wrong' and continuing to buy Nike shoes at every new release.

Until she removes herself from an industry that has a negative impact on society, but in particular, young girls, she is still part of the problem. And more locally, until she pursues a cause with a more altruistic base, she will remain ruled by the egoic stimulus of being a model, one that leaves you unhappy and insecure."

Before she was even close to being old enough to understand what she was getting in to. And now, as she said, there are many instances in which people don't take her seriously because of it. So she's fawned over and paid for modeling and being pretty. But at the same time, she was never given the change to be anything different. How many people will take her seriously if she publicly embarks on any intellectual endeavors? I honestly don't know. But the decision was made by others to objectify and sexualize her before she was old enough to understand the repercussions, and that's what I don't like.

I also notice that I do get checked out by women now and again. Nevertheless the privilege of being a good looking woman far outweighs being a good looking guy. Why? Because women do NOT place that much emphasis on looks and their concept of what is deemed attractive is extremely diverse. Instead confidence and personality is the real game changer. Admittedly looks helps to get you through the door but if you have no personality and lack confidence women will instantly deem them unworthy of their attentions.

I think the wording there shows insight to the feminist mindset. She did not say ""gender and racial bias"" she used the word ""oppression"" and when she says gender we know she means female oppression. So her privilege is actually the result of female oppression in her eyes and this is significant because when feminists talk about patriarchy they include all the privileges that women get as more examples of their oppression. This means even if we treat women perfectly equal any difference in gender roles is still viewed as a negative, including, for example, keeping women out of the draft. As a recent feminist said ""war hurts women the most because they become widows and single parents"". So when you have an ideology that classes female privileges as female oppression, then by definition we will never satisfy feminism because men and women are objectively different and will never be treated exactly the same in every way. 
But it is worse than that, feminists are fighting for privilege anyway, they don't want any of the negative things pure equality brings, no one is fighting for female models to get paid less like male models, no one is fighting for women to work in the mines in equal numbers as men yet numbers of female CEO's are important. Feminists are fighting a battle that can either never be won or if it can be won it will only be when women are more privileged than men in every single aspect of life."

I was watching this video because I was doing my research for fun about the industry (even though I know the truth), and it find it so interesting. I'm sitting here on my laptop right now looking at this gorgeous woman. I'm looking at her modelling photos and comparing them to mine. I want to get tips and tricks and apply it to my photos. I am looking at my phone camera to see how I looked while watching this video. When she said she feels insecure, I felt relieved. I felt relieved that a gorgeous woman like her can teach me a valuable lesson on loving yourself. She feels insecure with her looks even though she is absolutely stunning in her photos. I feel insecure as ever sometimes and then people tell me ""be quiet, you're a model you're gorgeous"". But that doesn't stop me from thinking negatively about myself. As a young model I WANT to have pictures that look like professional models, I practice my posing to make sure I won't be disappointed when I see the results. I'm glad to know that I'm not the only person who gets complimented on their looks yet still feels ugly as ever sometimes. It's a good feeling to know that I'm not the only individual who feels pressured by society. But in the end, I have come to realize that the importance that I put on others viewing my appearance is why too high. If a gorgeous, successful, model can look at themselves negatively after hearing ""you're face and body are a work of art"", it just goes to show you that the way you view another individual's appearance isn't the way they view themselves. AND THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD NOT COMPARE OURSELVES TO OTHERS! You may want to look like someone and have their physique because you are so infatuated with their appearance, yet that person doesn't think that way about themselves and is thinking like you are and comparing themselves to someone else. Obviously I'm still going to have some insecure days, but I need to remember this comment that I'm writing because it's helping me get a better understanding about reality. It's crazy how important a perspective is, and watching this video really changed my thoughts.

It doesn't just affect your chance to have a career in the beauty industry but in everything from social interactions to applying for something as mundane as a desk job. Statistics show that beautiful people succeed more than average or ugly people in every jobs. They also tend to have a better social life because people react nicely instinctively to them. Then in turn they develop confidence and go farther in life. This is a well documented phenomena it's called : The halo effect.

She went from being a super hot freak-of-nature skinny chick wearing a mini skirt and heals to being a super hot freak-of-nature skinny chick wearing a more conservative outfit. Wow, color me impressed. Look everyone, in spite of her attractiveness she's just like the rest of us mortal plebes!

While I do appreciate her candidness and objectivity when talking about this subject looking the way she does her whole ""don't judge me by my looks"" thing hardly seems genuine. I'm sure for the most part she'd like to believe that but probably has no problem ignoring that decree when it becomes convenient for her to gain an advantage. When it comes to dating for instance, I highly doubt she thinks her looks shouldn't matter when selecting a mate. Her looks will end up being the main factor determining which guy is eligible to date her. And since her attractiveness level is so high she will have the pick of the liter.

For example, If you've ever been on any online dating site you've probably seen guys who complain that they are not getting any responses. And what is the #1 guaranteed reply they will get? ""You must have too high of standards. You are probably trying to contact women who are out of your league, you are a 4 (or whatever low number) and you can't expect 8, 9's, and 10's to reply to you. They are out of your league"". Well if you can't judge a person by the way they look then how can a league system exist that would preclude you from access to dating someone before you've had a chance to know the person???? In other words, the ""league"" (aka is your looks comparable to hers...unless you're rich) is a precursor to whether or not you are even qualified to talk to the person in the first place...THE GETTING TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE ON THE INSIDE CAN ONLY HAPPEN AFTER THAT....So you are a 4 and you should KNOW better than to even think a 10 would talk to you...you should try to talk to other women in your own league...ie, someone who is also a 4. This is all based on looks alone.

I'll tell you nothing will bring down the wrath of righteous indignation more than hot chicks talking about men who failed to abide by this unwritten league rule and who tried to talk to them anyway. The code word they use to describe these men is ""CREEPS"".

You can't have it both ways. Looks either matter (personally believe they matter the most) or they don't. Either choice will bring inconveniences."

UgjpApzTeEHIi3gCoAEC,crystalidx,1440772601950,"There are many good-looking people in the world, both men and women. I am one of a hundred of good-looking people. And everyone good-looking people do know that looks 'can' be everything if you focus on it. She is a pretty white woman but that does not mean she has to 'show off' that she has a superior quality to her. I think she just wanted to prove herself better by becoming a model and speaking on TED."
UghAKQSDzcqYAHgCoAEC,Eddie,1440772601960,"She kind of has a man face, though."
UghMuqqVRld1HXgCoAEC,PlayOn A,1440772601972,"When someone in the ""public eye"" is deemed a ""sell out,"" what does that really mean?! It's far too easy to consider someone ""money hungry"" or a ""sell out""¬†when the one making that judgment has never, and probably will never, receive the same offer themselves. We ""believe"" what we ""believe"" because we have been pre-conditioned for years upon years to do so. Case and point: Models are illusive depictions of what ""society,"" particularly, those ""in power,"" have decided to consider ""beautiful"". Much like the idea of us women shaving our bodies¬†and having longer hair (typically), society perpetuates an image that the mass majority abides by. IF WE WEREN'T MEANT TO GROW HAIR IN THE PLACES IT GROWS, THEN IT WOULDN'T GROW THERE TO BEGIN WITH! Girls wear pink. Boys don't cry. It's all perpetual. Just keep in mind that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This model was preyed upon, accepted the perks of being consumed, then had an epiphany...There's some terrible people out there, but both that and vanity aside, I believe everyone has a bit of beauty in them..."
Ugi2odvfaJbfr3gCoAEC,Dirk Van Der Merwe,1440772601982,"Hey, another TED talk on white guilt! Not sure how that is an ""Ideas Worth Spreading"".

As for her comments on stop and frisk, let me use an analogy: Everyone knows cycling has a huge doping problem, but in order for the cyclists not to feel discriminated against, they should do equal amounts of testing amongst cyclists and chess players, or simply stop testing cyclists. Now, one would say that both these scenarios are ridiculous, but this is exactly the logic being applied to stop and frisk."
UggW3AxUuC70m3gCoAEC,Jesse,1440772601994,"What I got from this after not even thinking hard because it's literally what she's saying but some people overthink things too much and are ignorant: She was genetically gifted, praised, things were handed to her when she thinks/knows she didn't earn it, wondered why, and that looks aren't everything. We shouldn't worry about looks so much. There's way more to life. Sure looks are freakin' amazing to have, but we shouldn't be focused on it so much as to where we're not comfortable with ourselves. Be confident. She apologizes for her career, and how fucked society is. Sure, she's a model, but that's not who ""she"" is, you know. Everybody somehow misses this point. Also, funny how people are saying she's conceited. Are you fuckin' kidding me...Morons."
Uggiib8fHofidXgCoAEC,aaarrreee,1440772602005,"I don't understand her ultimate conclusion. If she chose to go and live in Africa she would probably be the target of racism everyday, being the minority. Only 4 percent of models are non-white because all the major fashion brands started in America or Western Europe so they cater to white people who tend to be the most affluent and are the target audience for expensive merchandise. There are a lot of places in the world where white people are a minority or don't even exist and still the native people of that group have a hard time forming simple but necessary constructs to govern and dictate the general well being of the collective. Why blame yourself or the circumstances of history for the deliberate shortcomings of others. People, anywhere in the world, will respect you if you are considerate and productive. That's it, beauty doesn't matter."

Half of the people in the U.S. are white. You are a ""supply"" meeting a ""demand"". There are a lot of women who want to look like you and a lot of men who would like to be in a relationship someone that looks like you. There is no reason to feel guilty about that. Of course, the part of the talk that I could appreciate is the part where she shows that the ""look"" in those pictures aren't real. That is the most important thing to understand about magazine pictures. Not the fact that someone gave her a free dress or let her out of a speeding ticket because she is pretty. Also, how is she comparing herself to a high crime city were a lot of minorities live. Of course young dark skinned males get stopped the most. They are the ones that live in the high crime areas for the most part. It's not because they are black, it because they live were the crimes are committed. High crime areas are war zones."

¬†At least one's weight and fashion sense can be helped, you can't help your height.¬† Then there's income, which has many factors outside of a man's control such as education, early environment, parents' wealth, etc.¬† Even if you work hard (and get lucky, and somehow get over singles' discrimination, a TED topic for another video) by the time you're settled with good money your youth will be gone and money will be that one reason why women will even give you a second look.

""Where do you work?"" means, ""Do you have money?"" So women are shallow too.¬†

Tl;dr: Women are at least as shallow as men (men have lower standards in general compared to similar women, nearly all those standards are within the control of the female herself) and finding a good lady is tougher than finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.¬† Given the very strict criteria of life evolving in general such as amino acids not getting fried by UV and gamma radiation on a planet perfect for life (Goldilocks zone, Earth like gravity and size, medium sized yellow star to output the correct radiation ratio to prevent too much radiation from stopping abiogenesis, gas giants to attract asteroids, tides, carbon to consume for the first microscopic life to convert to oxygen via digestion eventually leading to the first mass extinction event where the new generations consume oxygen, etc.) and five mass extinction events, as well as a catalyst to bring out that intelligence such as discovering a practical usage for fire and eventually inventing writing that's quite difficult.¬† The odds are 10^screw it many zeroes.¬†

Besides, Like modeling is such a Noble job, u walk and pose, get over yourself.  And minorities have smaller market, of course they have fewer models, if 80% of the targeted population are purple, I'm sure there'd be a lot purple models.  People in all societies look up to the riches, they want to be wealthy, not a certain color, it just happens western countries are more advanced at this point, and mostly whites are controlling the money, people's opinion of beauty are leaning towards where money is going, not because u r just so beautiful, the world is falling for u. this model just states what she observes, but she fails to scratch the surface and dig into it; she tried so hard to look like she has a problem, but comes across as snobby and superficial.

As a model, she acknowledges that looks indeed have power over the corrupt police system and that her race and gender as a white woman can give her a leeway. She also exposes how the media deconstructs her as a person and forms a separate image that is not her. She understands that she did win a lottery, not only as a pretty person but as a skinny, tall figure that is so idolized in our modern society. She is basically telling us that being a model is not a dream job, but rather a fallback, because she tells us that there is no purpose being a model (as she had told the kids to be anything else than a model), because being a model comes with a cost of being insecure all the damn time and being deconstructed to a photoshopped image. I think that we should not invalidate her point just because she is more privileged, because she APOLOGIZES for that, rather, we should look at what she is saying and stop idolizing models, stop encouraging girls to look tall and skinny, stop focusing on looks so much and see beyond a person.

And that we should not judge a person by how they look or how they may appear, by the color on their skin, their gender or their occupation, because the thing that truly matters is who they are on the inside, what they feel, who they aspire to be and what they offer to the world.

It quickly turns from ""Yay! A free meal!"" to ""Why didn't that girl get one?"" to ""Maybe those people were rude to me because I'm not thin enough"" to ""I will never look like that girl no matter how much I starve, she is more valuable than me, I am a failure, those close to me probably don't even like me because they are more beautiful."" ¬†This is why she began listing the apparent benefits, but then at the very end, finishes with ""I am insecure"". The take away message is not to get into that slippery slope. If you are valued for your appearance, don't become your appearance. In the end, you will be chasing an ever-changing ideal that will leave never fulfilled and you will become more and more miserable with yourself.

When I first clicked on the video, I honestly didn't think she was going to say all those things. I think it is so powerful to admit that you have been the beneficiary of centuries of racial, ethnic, and gender bias. I think it is amazing for her to admit and acknowledge that especially when she is a model too. And let's be real, we all probably have that stereotype about her, that girls like her don't have anything in their brains, that they are just stupid, vapid girls who care about nothing but superficiality. But it is a great eye opener to realize that in her case, it is the opposite. She is super thoughtful and raises some great points about how humans view certain things. I think that all the things she pointed are so true. I think there are so many wrong things in our society that makes us all value superficiality. All people care about is money, which is why producing the most beautiful, unrealistic picture of a skinny white girl (which is society's idea of beauty) is the goal. I mean, really, why are women so objectified? Certainly, because of our history. Girls are so insecure about their bodies because society leads us to believe that women should be objectified and their bodies should be a certain way. This is why I think Cameron says that models are the most insecure because they must ascribe to this unrealistic ideal that we are all buying into. Also, why does our society value superficiality so much as opposed to honesty and realness and love and all the other things we should value and that we maybe valued in the past? Why does Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton get so much money for literally being a waste of human space? And the thing is, it is not Kim Kardashian's fault that people constantly reward her for contributing nothing to society, it is all our faults for idealizing her. Why do people watch all her shows on TV? If we all stopped watching them, she wouldn't even be famous or earn money. Why are hard working teachers and nurses not the ones who get attention? They contribute so much to society, yet they get rewarded so little. Maybe it is just that there is something inherently wrong with humans. Maybe we are just programmed to value the wrong things, to reward the underserving. Maybe it is something about life, that it is inherently unfair. But maybe also, in the end, the deserving are rewarded. Those who are remembered are those who fought the hardest and were oppressed the most such as Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. Anyway, that was my super philosophical rant for the day."

Boys didn't like me because I was fat and it lead me to grow up thinking I was worth less because of my weight. I think that it stunted me socially to be fat. I became anorexic at age 13 when I weighted 180lbs. I struggled for years with my body image and various eating disorders. I was able to get over my eating disorders in college and I now have a bachelors of science in Nutrition and I am a first year medical student working on my M.D. in Texas and weight 180lbs as a 5'11 22 year old.

Looks don't matter? They always have to me. They mattered when people spent their time around me reminding me of how bad my looks are.

They matter when I walk out of the house to work, wondering if people are going to think less of me or respect me less because I'm not pretty or thin.

Those values are indeed superficial and I think that when people open up about it and say they actually don't like being treated differently because of their appearance, it gives others perspective on how things could or should be. Doesn't mean you can't dress up.

A beautiful person could easily become insecure about their inner values and its importance, being favored for their looks, likewise an ugly person could be very insecure about their appearance and how it affects the people around them, feeling restricted. We all know very well that looks do not express potential, it just isn't who we are, the shell around the egg. That's what I find so charming about Cameron, she admits knowing even with her good looks and exploiting them. Superficiality should be recognized for what it is. It's people that play with it's meaning that change the perceived reality around us. It's an abnormality just like our existence. It is what it is.

Extroverts get a lot more attention too so it's not just about looks. Everyone wants to hire the outspoken person which makes introverts feel less desirable in society.

They have built an image that gives society the idea of ""how people esp females should look"", or even ""how their skin colour should be?"". They are the main influences, look at magazines, fashion shows, ads everything. Models have insecurity? I understand that, on the other hand I don't think they care or fully understand (of course, because it is a built industry) ¬†that their 'image' creates a 'standard example' of defining & showing what 'beauty' should look like and be - pressuring young girls or teens in believing that concept.

Ugipb1p1h5WBXXgCoAEC,ImJustDead,1409236717956,"It's a tough issue. On the one hand, it's much easier to say ""looks aren't everything"" when you already look fucking awesome, call it modesty? On the other hand, you can't really say that statement if you look ""below par"" simply because people won't take you seriously claiming you are defending yourself.

To me, 'showing' us how looks isn't everything instead of a beautiful woman 'telling' us why it isn't everything is far more relevant.

Good looking people, in my opinion, has the edge over the rest simply because they are attractive (attractive in the sense that they get other people's attention much quicker) to other people, it's been demonstrated before.

UgjkfqE3GR8Fn3gCoAEC,Loredana Esposito,1409236717976,"What's the bottomline here? The final message cites 'Legacy plays a role in the way we are perceived and we perceive'. Or is this tirade more on the contrast between the way we look and the invisible fragility inside? ¬†It is about insecurity? Well in that case I have to say that I think about how I look like every day but in a very different way! Because no matter how much my hair is shining and how thin my thighs are I still look ugly because of the rest of my body is objectively ugly. Does that make an insecure person of me? How insecure do you think I am or how insecure should I be according to this claim? I still think about the way I look every day, just like this lady!

Ugi6Wl2dCf2r5ngCoAEC,Carlos  Danger,1409236721502,"I certainly agree with the message Cameron is espousing, but this begs the question, why are you a model? It would be one thing if she was a model before she became more educated and well versed on the deleterious influence media portrayal has on female self-image, but yet, she's still a model. She lambastes an industry where only 4 percent of the models are non-white, but yet, she's still a model. She still works for and makes money for the same industry that she is criticizing. She tells young girls ""why would you want to be a model, you can be anything"", but yet, she's still a model. She could be anything (social worker, businesswoman, scientist), she could lead by example, but yet, she continues to represent a corrupt industry.

She tells us that the pictures of her that you see on the magazines are not really her, that they are only construction of a false reality and yet, she allows the industry to continue to reconstruct her for their own agenda. She tells us she gets stuff that she does not deserve for free, but yet she accepts it anyway. She didn't have to take that dress from Cambridge, and she certainly could have given it to someone else or sold it and given the money to those who deserve it more. And who knows, maybe she did, I wasn't there, but if she didn't, it certainly leaves a bad taste in ones mouth. She tell's us she is insecure because she has to think about what she looks like everyday. You are not trapped in this profession; you cannot be forced to grace the cover of magazines in scantly clad clothing.

There is a reason why a large majority of academics shun the mainstream media and the reason for that is education. Education of what it truly is that the media does to those too ignorant, vulnerable, lacking in education and those who have been exposed to cognitive predetermination's by social institutions put into place during their adolescent developmental years is what separates the intellectuals from the people they are trying to educate. The problem that Cameron faces is not her message; the message is golden and of great great significance. The deeper issue is that her message is currently hypocritical. If Cameron was truly passionate about promoting positive self-image she would not continue to work for this industry. She would never grace another cover of a magazine in an industry that propagates the kind of unhealthy messages she is fighting against. Do as I say not as I do. For Cameron to take the next step and be taken seriously as an intellectual, she needs to truly bite the hand that feeds her and get introspective and ask herself why she is still currently in this industry. Because as it stands, she's talking about the problem, but she's still contributing to the problem."

If the market wants white models, it's a win-win. If you want to see black models, you can buy-fund the magazines and the media promoting them. But coming out and saying there's some kind of (deeeer duuuur) white privillege is at least ignorant.¬†

But that's not who she is as a person, that's what you see and know of her. Her point is that there is more to her and just because she looks that way doesn't mean she can't have issues like everyone else. At the same time she understands what she gets. Someone once told me that you never know someone else situation until you step in there shoes. That the person that look like they have it together but doesn't really. I think before you sit there and talk about how your life is worst or how they have it all you should know them first. Plus models are pressured when it comes to there weight.

Some times we'll just go to a coffee shop. ¬†She'll go first and order a small coffee with 3 packets of sugar. ¬†I'll order a small coffee with some milk. ¬†One time her card got declined, the barista said its alright its on the house. ¬†A few weeks later we went back and I realized I forgot my wallet, the same barista told me he could hold my coffee while I went home to get my wallet. ¬†Thankfully my lovely friend had gotten paid that week and said she'd take care of it. ¬†The barista told her she was so generous and gave us both for free. ¬†I don't want to say its because she's a pretty girl who wears a size two and has legs a hundred miles long. ¬†But this has happened many times and almost always the person who gives her the benefit is a man who finds her attractive but doesn't find me attractive because I'm really pale, and I wear a size ten and kind of dorky glasses that make my eyes look too big for my face. ¬†And I even I get stopped on the streets by people telling me I'm pretty, but I'm only pretty if there isn't someone prettier to compare to, and in someways my being less attractive actually makes her look even better. But ¬†even with our male friends, she gets perks I don't. ¬†We'll go out for dinner and he'll pay for his and offer to pay for hers. ¬†He'll never offer to pay for mine, because he doesn't find me attractive. ¬†But even she has a friend who is taller and has longer legs and bigger breasts and a more conventionally attractive face who gets perks she doesn't. ¬†And so this piece really makes me think. ¬†I know that my friend has insecurities about how she looks, she thinks she's too slim and hates how long her legs are and doesn't like the shape of her face. ¬†She keeps telling me that she wishes she looked like me and ""actually had hips."" ¬†But knowing a girl that a good portion of the straight male society finds attractive, and watching a piece about the power and downfalls of being beautiful and how its difficult to understand the racial and physical and social influences of beauty being a person who its socially the definition of beauty, it makes me wonder about what its like to navigate those implications being someone who isn't that definition. ¬†I can navigate it in a different way than my friend and she navigates it differently than hers. ¬†A model will navigate it differently than the rest of us, a woman of color will navigate it differently than someone who isn't. ¬†Different backgrounds navigate it differently, different socioeconomic groups navigate it differently. As do people of different weights, sexual orientations, regions of the country, regions of the world. ¬†But we can't really get what its like in a general sense until all these people make known their navigation through what it is to be pretty."

But she has been a model for 10 years, earnt a fortune just by walking up and down on the catwalk, and now, when she is getting too old for modelling or just wants to retire in her thirties (she can already do that because she has already earned enough money for the rest of her life), so now she is telling us that beauty is not everything. This is hypocrite. Her whole life shows us that to be a gorgeous woman is a huge advantage in every aspect of your life. What I am trying to highlight is that I have the same impression about this which was shown in the film Good Will Hunting. If you haven't watched the film, it's about a young genius who born with his outstanding talent and did nothing for it. He is smarter than any professor and can do any type of job but he works in constructions and lives in the slum, because his talent is not valuable for him. Ok, this is the same with her beauty, it has no value for her but once again: if there is no value for her why did she become a modell and not anything else? And BTW I'm a 24 year-old-guy, not an ugly raging MILF, but this is my opinion. And sorry for my English it is not my first language."

I love looking at my favorite models do the runway even though I don't have their legs, Its there for enjoyment, not for self evaluation. Find the middle ground. I never thought of models as being beautiful, really. Most of them are a bit odd looking. They are a components of a lovely photo.Cameron however, is whiny, not sufficiently wise, and been drinking the liberal Koolaid a bit too long.

2. She, naively, believes that what the industry thinks is beautiful is naturally what all people think is beautiful.

Oh, my, it must be sooo difficult to travel to exotic places in the world frolic about for a couple of hours,eat at great restaurants and vacation at resorts. Yes, after all the life of a model must be so much more difficult than working construction, working in a coal mine, working on an oil platform, or being a car mechanic. Or working REAL jobs that contribute far more to society with little ay lie being a high school teacher.

But somehow I'm suppose to accept that models are the most insecure people on the planet? I mean its not like they have to worry about whether the electricity is going to be on next month, or wondering if they can afford the next car payment.

Cameron lives or lived in a world where most of what she was fed was a steady diet of yes and appeasement and privileges few people on the planet are fortunate enough to experience in ten lifetimes. And suddenly near the (presumably) tail end of a career that has only elevated her to other opportunities most are denied with far more merit, she has the nerve to miraculously acquire a conscience and lecture the very people who work harder, longer and with less to show for it about insecurities? I have only one question. Cameron, when you were a model and having such a tough time enjoying the perks of ¬†privilege just on your looks, did you cash the checks they gave you?

UghZb6DAfFeRSXgCoAEC,Tierchenmeister,1409236753080,"Sorry, but I don't like the UNDERLYING message of this video. Please, if I completely missunderstood, feel free to correct me (and if so, my apologies for what I am about to say also go to the young lady in the video)

Now, first of, let me say that she seems hypocritical to me. Why? Well, she wants to make it seem like she kinda dislikes that everything is superficial, thus portraiting herself as a 'good' person who TRIES to stand above superficially judging people or herself. Thus she tries to show her own 'noble' striving towards freedom of vanity, it seems. Yet, throughout the video, I couldn't help but feel that secretly she actually wanted to rub in to us how lucky she was. Like, when she was saying sth along the lines of ''It's so unfair, I'm only privilged because I'm a pretty, white girl'' - I don't know, that sounds pretty vain to me. Again, if I missunderstood, I am deeply sorry, but that is the impression this video left me with.

But that's not my main point. The problem is the underlying message. She basically suggests that either you are lucky and you're born with the perfect looks or you are not and there is basically very little chance of ever improving your situation. That message right there is extremely discouraging to many, and also wrong. Not everyone is just gonna accept it like ''oh, I think I look bad, but now it's okay because the lady said it's not right to think looks are important anyways''.

Now, let me start of by saying that I think humans do have some sort of an influence on their outer appearance that goes beyond pure genetics (and i DON'T mean plastic surgery, nonono!). There's so many things factoring in on this, for instance: one's perception of himself/herself, relations to people you grow up with, what you eat, neurotic behavior (or rather NO neurotic behavior), just to name a few of these factors.
Just reducing the looks to a matter of genes is plain wrong, and could probably discourage some people quite a bit. Besides, people carry several 'hidden' genes which can be deactivated or activated by certain circumstances/lifestyles.

Besides, I don't like the whole ''I feel so bad about it but I do it anyways'' vibe and the ''It's sooo unfair that police men and people in general treat me better because I'm so pretty'' - sorry, still sounds vain and hypocritical (again, as I was saying above, speak up and correct me if I'm wrong)

Lastly, why on earth would she tell us 5:44? Also, all those pictures of her life, like a slide show. I know, it's her profession to ''exhibit'' herself (sorry if I used incorrect word), but that still seems so... narcissistic... in a way. If I am wrong, feel free to enlighten me, but well, that's the impression I had :P"

She starts off with how you shouldn't judge based on people appearance through fashion... I should now stop judging and avoiding boys for wearing their pants to their knees because that's just not nice... It's like how we naturally avoid quacks like Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus in public... we should just stop because it's mean. OK.

And the part about racism, yes you shouldn't mistreat someone simply because of the hue of their skin, any humane decent person would agree and support civil rights among races in society, but all that just doesn't fit in with this speech.

During that phase the reception and general judgement I would receive from people tended to be dismissive. Now that I have blossomed into someone of an average build and am now apparently aesthetically considered' above average' (whatever that means) the manner in which the world perceives me has transformed. Now all of a sudden women are more forgiving of my faults and mistakes and I've now become more desirable to the opposite sex.

I personally broke that a few years ago by understanding that beauty does not equal happiness & my life has changed for the better. It's very easy actually, never judge someone based on the way they look & get to know them for who they are. I've dated a couple of girls who were models before but as they were empty inside by only caring about BS like celebrities, TV, movies etc, it never lasted & I would never date a girl based on looks again. My advice to women (& even some men) in these comments is to work on yourself & who you are, learn to love & look after yourself, spend time helping those less fortunate than you & everything else will fall into place as if by magic.

UghZP0vn8mUiQ3gCoAEC,RetardskillMe,1409236787531,"Of course there are smart women who go into modeling... But those are just the minority. Look at those dumb bimbos in those pageant shows... Look at those who are in runway shows... Most people who chose their career in life as a model are because of two things. One is vanity. Two is number one. And what leads to this vanity? Environment and poor upbringings. Why?

Pretty girls get adored, get more glances, get more attention, get more affection. For that, they started to put more and more attention on their appearances as they grow up. Overtime, as they understand what lies out there in the society, they have the underlying notion that they can still go into modeling even if they fail in class. With such a safety net, why would they work hard?

Parents who are over relaxed¬†in bringing up their kids, can never shape their kids¬†into a particular type of person or of much calibre. If you let a kid do what he or she¬†wants, and the kid grew up with no ambition or goal in life, why wouldn't he or she take up modeling? Imparting the right core values to a person while young is important.

Now about a model being smart.. Sure, this model thinks more, and considered more about life, but is that truly smart? Smart¬†is an issue of relativity, and she is just 'smarter' than a lot of models out there..."

Life is so much easier. No amount of self-delusion through positive thinking will change those facts. This video did nothing to take my mind off that fact. 1. She still looked as beautiful with or without that clothing change. 2. Models are only insecure because they're models, not because they're beautiful.

Though she brought up several important topics, she failed to really explain any of them. She basically said she's lucky that shes hot but she still feels insecure. And she also stated that non-caucasian people get harrassed by police more often. Now I'm not calling her stupid. But, for any of you that feel the need to defend her. Don't tell me how I'm stupid or I missed her point unless you can explain to me what her point was. The way I took this speech, was that shes an insecure model..

I'm sure that contrary to others mentioned you had a choice. So just thank your parents for what you are and try to make the best out of you. You seem like a very nice person, and I think you can still be pretty much everything you wanted to be.

And do you really want to be a president? Why? Because of the power and the recognition? Would it make you happy? They have to deal constantly with stress, being on the media. Away from family and constantly followed by guards. Are presidents whining about that?"

That's why models are attractive! That's why movie stars are hot! It's sad but it's true.

As a young Hispanic female I can say that I know where I am placed in terms of beauty within my society. As ¬†Hispanic women are often deemed to be curvy and sexual but not nearly as beautiful as how the young white women are represented. I mean, this is just from my point of view, my place in beauty may be different to others. What I can't seem to understand is why are we as a society so fixated in being beautiful, having the perfect body, and face? I have researched that universal beauty is aliened ¬†with symmetry and the more symmetrical your face is the more beautiful it is. Sure, this may have some sound evidence because I believe we can all agree on some individuals whom may fit a universal attractiveness. However, I believe beauty is more than just a pretty face. Sometimes it cant be explained, and sometimes you may not notice someones beauty after a while of getting to know them. I feel as though media keeps trying to keep beauty within a box and brain wash us with physical traits that are desirable within certain ethic groups of people. However, this is where media messes up because it tends to chose models of different ethnic groups which more closely resembles that of white ¬†feature's or complexions. for example, in the media like spanish soap operas or westernized television, latina women are often tanned, have black long hair, with curvy bodys. Or sometimes they look white. However, media hardly recognizes latina women whom are black and whom have more Caribbean features. Imagine the message this sends to young latina women? I use latina women as an example from my experience, but I believe this is the same for many other ethnic groups as well."

Thus my series ""Pre-Addictions Educational Series"" is to start this conversation about drugs, alcohol, overeating much earlier with children than age 11. (A common response that I receive is Uncle Bob walks too much? I call these ""white addictions"" they seem harmless on the surface but when some exercises to the point they're blowing their knees out or they're robbing their kids of ""one on one"" time there's a problem. This first book breaks the idea down of ""over doing things"" and engages children in critical thinking through the main cute character ""Amanda Cope"".

17 Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab
The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,

The jingling anklets, the scarves, and the crescents;
19 The pendants, the bracelets, and the veils;
20 The headdresses, the leg ornaments, and the headbands;
The perfume boxes, the charms,

The nose jewels,
22 the festal apparel, and the mantles;
The outer garments, the purses,
23 and the mirrors;
The fine linen, the turbans, and the robes.
24 And so it shall be:
Instead of a sweet smell there will be a stench;
Instead of a sash, a rope;
Instead of well-set hair, baldness;
Instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth;

UgjRy-ynryw2WngCoAEC,Precaseptica,1409236864550,"Improving physical appearance is one of the best ways to socialise, because it sheds your integrity the fastest and lets you become a bodiless shape to be absored by the masses as a dream or an illusion. It drains everything about you that individualises you and replaces it with mutable substances that can change depending on who is watching to sate their need or want for something to look up to or aspire to.

As a model you are working to increase global depression and teenage suicides. You are effectively becoming a weapon for the industries concerned with such to destabilise their consumers to ensure rising profits. You want this life because it promises glory, fame, fortune and recognition, just like some people want the Big Mac on the picture because it promises to make your mouth euphoric. It's escapism for you and poison for everyone touched by your success.

It's another example in the line of examples that human beings are manipulated into buying things, ideas and dreams they neither want or need. It is no coincidence that our western culture perpetuates consumption beyond anything, regardless of the fact that consumption is almost proportionately rising with depression and anxiety.

The solution lies in stepping out of your heels. Letting your hair go. Smiling regardless of whether you had braces or not. Laughing like your tonsils are the most beautiful thing on you. It requires some spine to do this, because you will upset your peers. The group of people surrounding you because you made it your goal in life to move yourself as far away from yourself as a child as possible.

But if she is sincere, great for her, at least she has some basic principles in life. But then people saying that looks is everything are a small minority. People love beauty this is not brainwashing. We did not construct the need for beauty anymore than an animal construct the need to find a good looking mate and yes animals do that a lot.There is a profound meaning in the search for beauty and that search can have many different manifestation.

At least as a man I can say that the vast majority of guys out there they wont stay in a relationship tolerating a bad personality for great looks. So looks not only they are not everything they are not even the most important thing.

I am also not convinced that she got favors in her life because of her looks. I am not a very good looking man, just above average and I had many favors in my life. And I am not even a woman, though I am white. So I am not buying this either. Some people are nice. Yes this world has loads of nice people still.¬†

I am not also unfamiliar with what it means to be very good looking, my mother was as good looking as her if not more. at here age, and she still is very good looking for her age. I could see the effect her external looks had on people and besides some very nice compliments pretty much that was it. It was not as big deal as people make it. She was never treated as a goddess and she taught us not to put much notice on looks alone. ¬†¬†

And is not even hard to find good looking women or good looking men. So in the end I would say ""Its not as a big deal as you think, get over it!""

And most people that are really ugly usually is because they dont take care themselves. Personally I prefer a woman with the wrong genes that takes care of herself and she has a good personality over a woman with excellent genes that does not take care of herself and has also a good personality.¬†

Experience also taught me that people not taking care their looks , they tend not to take care their personality too. Though the opposite certainly is not as true as I would want it to be."
UggkvZ7Q2zXWj3gCoAEC,malignor,1409236864659,"Cameron pretty much says it...

Who the heck would want to be a model? A career of petty insecurity where you get told what to do and how to do it. It's a career of zero personal respect, only shallow admiration.
The only reason to be a model is because, if you won the genetic lottery like Cameron, it's easy money and easy fame. Cameron, at least, knows how to use her looks for success, and use that success to earn some genuine respect.

And image is indeed important. Think about a job interview, or approaching a stranger in public, or trying to get a date... these mere social events can potentially change your entire life: a career, a friend, a spouse and family. And they depend on image."

It is good to shed light on some of the problems in society that are occurring; but i do not completely agree with her outlook on life. She said she is a model but that is not who she is but only her profession. What she fails to understand is that, what you do every day for work AND what you do outside of work IS who you are. Every single decision you make in life is a part of WHO or WHAT you are as a person. The world has many different effects on a person and people cannot always control their situations or surroundings but anytime people are given a choice they become more of themselves. Who you were yesterday and who you are today can be different people also. If you choose to go to work every day and be a model, YOU ARE A MODEL. I'm not saying that is a good or bad thing.

The title is like saying 'being white isn't everything', being white gives one amazing amount of advantage but at the same time other races may hate you and judge for your privileges, when really race shouldn't matter. So the alternative title to this scenario should be 'race shouldn't matter'.
Which is what I feel like she was trying to get across, that we shouldn't be judging people by their exterior appearance as a method of judging one's ability. And in the same way stereotypes of race are reinforced through media and public opinion so are looks."

When I was kid I was kinda of chubby, had very little friends, had a jew fro, and poor grades I was not happy because of those things, but I was happy because I was myself and nobody cared to tell me otherwise, I was artistic and imaginative. Now I'm 19 very attractive (due to facial structure) athletic(high metabolism kicked in as well as natural muscle growth) successful in college (that I'll admit was hard work) and I am happy about that but I now have a constant sense of inadequacy like I could still do better also now people pay attention to me and they judge me, ALWAYS. None of my genetic gifts console me of that fact. In fact the stigma's in our society that surround superficial beauty make it so that when someone like my girlfriend Says,"" you're pretty"" I take it as either ""Oh he looks like shit today let me cheer him up"" Or ""You're pretty stupid but it's ok because you're pretty"" contradictory statements and yet that is what goes through my mind all the time and I believe both of them at times.

This woman was even factually wrong when she said that tall, slim figures have been considered beautiful for centuries. This is actually a legacy of the postwar world, where capitalism put a dollar-value on physical attractiveness and hence created an industry (see 17th, 18th and 19th art regarding the female form).

All I am saying is that looks a huge play a foundation in the dating game. And I disagree about women not being open to being picked up by strangers. Again, if she likes your looks and you act normal, she will be open to it. Thats why women go to bars and clubs."

IT doesn't matter how you meet a girl...social circle, class, through work, at a friends place..if she doesn't like your looks, she won't care for your other personality traits.

They judge on looks alone because its all they know about you.  If you have something else to offer find a subtle way to show it off.  For example I like to take girls to beginner's sailing, it shows my fitness, wealth, and confidence (obvious I can already do it) without me coming off like an asshole."

It takes drinking soda all the time. It takes eating fast food packed with HFCS. It takes eating cheap frozen food and preserved snacks from the grocery store.

How do you enjoy life when you're constantly consumed in how you look and you feel your looks validate you as a person.

I'm old, fat, got big ears, arthritis, going deaf, bald, never been handsome etc, but I have loads of interests, lots of laughs & I'm comfortable in my skin. I feel sorry for models, they're just a well paid (a few of them) coat hanger or a lump of meat."

I'm a boxer myself and I'm a sparring partner for paid pro fighters.  Pacman is just one of the fighters we study.  What I've learnt from boxing all these years, guys like pac, hearns, duran etc...They have a genetic gift that gives extra edge.  Combine that with their upbringing, environment, circumstances, you have legends.  Hardwork is just as important as circumstance and genes.  But u can't ctrl the last 2"
UgzBPIsw8g6M5DFEQ_R4AaABAg,JinKazama92,1377701093851,"Im not convinced enough. People like Mozart, or perhaps Pacquiao are seen as genetically talented. I 101% disagree with that. The truth about Mozart is that he was born into a musical environment. Pacqiao had a good teacher. You should check out Pacquiao's early boxing age videos on youtube. His fights when he was still a kid. He always loses."

Being athletically gifted or being born with a genius level IQ are such talents. On the other hand, having talent alone doesn't mean much unless you work hard and hone your skills...especially those that compliment your talents. I mean look at basketball players. Do you think someone taught them height or they worked hard to grow up so tall? No but they worked on their skills. Genetics still has some part in it"

UgwyG9AWwIyGqU1bqXV4AaABAg,Tarryn Tracey,1377701094811,"I don't think that is what she was saying at all.

Around 25 minute mark, he explains how Steve Jobs would not have been head of Apple if he didn't grow up where he grew up.  I'm sure he talks about Bill Gates as well, because in his book, he wrote about Gates and Job simultaneously."
UgxyXNV4det4zOHxPDB4AaABAg,John Lai,1377701094839,"Bill gates had circumstances in his favour.  You should read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.  I think he may have given TED talks on the subject as well.  But basically, hard work is always a requirement.  But being an outlier often times requires circumstances/genetics.  Gates got his 10000 hours early, before the majority of people even had access to computers."

But guys like mayweather jr., pacquiao, tesla, have MORE than just skills, they have circumstances and genetics that put them on another level.  Using Mayweather and Pacman as example, their handspeed is a genetic gift.  Pacman's punching power is related to his body structure (ie. genetics).  Tesla had photographic memory, personality abnormalities etc..(genetics again) all contributed to his super genius."

Probably not. NOTE: I looked into her educational history and it IS impressive. The act of her revealing this concrete truth is nothing fearless. The fearless move would be if she moved to a more chalenging profession of industrial design, nursing, or any other professional field, and thus do modeling on the side."

Maybe she couldn't afford to quit her job because she knew how other people were treated compared to her. Some cops get special treatment and they aren't always happy, but they can't just quit. She might've done it for ten years because she needed the money and work. She didn't model to make people feel insecure.

Beauty standards are nature and association. They have tried to push the whole multi cultural and diversity junk down our throats for decades and not much has changed all that much. If you go to many meetings or groups of folk people segregate up on their own. If white is seen as the most beautiful why should we attempt to change that?"

Girls are always going to be trying to obtain that ideal of what they see in magazines and on television. Russel has shown no real insight here. Is she quitting modelling? No. She reminds me of a lot of rich people who basically go out there and say the general population should not aspire to achieve what the likes of Russel already have.  Its easy to say that when you have a few million in the bank.

The point was that chasing an artificial, socially constructed (and rather ridiculous) ideal of beauty and perfection will not guide you to happiness, but rather increase the insecurities and guilt for being unable to fully appreciate and be grateful for the things you have, especially those which are just a result of chance and not hard work."
UgxpohTSDg0KH7eZi3l4AaABAg,BlueSkyDaisukiAyumi,1377701149549,"From what I gathered, I believe the point she was trying to put across wasn't that she is more than a pretty face, but that behind what is so often perceived as an image of perfection lies a huge deal of insecurities and hidden worries, and that we should try to see those aspects too. You can tell that it can't have been easy for her to say that despite being one of the greatest beneficiaries of it, nothing about being the socially accepted image of perfection makes her happy."

Isn't it more of an fact that you are to afraid to try something new, to find your strengths....I can almost promise you that if you were happy with your self you would not want to be more smart/beautiful.

I'm in the awkward ""above average"" category where I'm ""smart"" but want more smarts because it's not quite good enough... and then I'm ugly and want to be beautiful.

What success I have, I built for myself. The friends I have hang out with me because of me rather than my money or looks. So who was the lucky one? My sister's early life was luxury and pampering when I had to work, but the success I have now is due to my own work.
My fat geeky teenage years, my years of being a social outcast, all forced me to become a level headed, hard working, fair minded and loyal to my friends. So who was the lucky one?"

It sucked being in her shadow as a kid. I had to work for every bit of success and acceptance in society while she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.
Now though, she's in poverty and still has a totally self centered narcissistic personality and wonders why no one likes her anymore. On the other hand I enjoy the success that my hard won skills have brought me. Oh I'm no millionaire but I have a rock steady career that brings in about 70k a year."

I know the feeling. I was an ugly teen too. I also have an older sister who was beautiful and very popular in her youth. She never had to strive to develop career or even a decent personality because of that beauty. She went through her 20's, 30's, living off men who couldn't wait to support her.

After all, if it is an order, then order men not to sexualise. It's made too easy for men to get away with sexualising and women being subject to that.

Granted, none of that talent came from my parents, BUT they're encouragement is what kept me practicing and developing that talent. There's nothing wrong with telling kids that the sky's the limit. It's much better than limiting them unnecessarily. You just can't forget the part about how they need to work to get there."

I'm no Piaget, but I believe a child's environment and upbringing are more important factors and markers for success than genetics. No one said kids are little geniuses (though, crucially, their capacity for learning things is known to outstrip that of adults), but instilling in them the values to aim high doesn't necessarily mean raising entitled brats - just the opposite, really. 

Not that being president requires any great genius, however much we like to pretend it does."

Genetics set the bar for everyone, children are not geniuses or models or have any modicum of artistic talent. That is the problem with parents these days, they raise these entitled children that grow up believing that they are awesome and expect that everything will go their way and when it doesn't then they throw a tantrum and start blaming other people."
UgxbsAeAJPNiMKKQI894AaABAg,Tori Garcia,1377701186868,I greatly admire this woman's vulnerability and honesty. It takes courage to admit to being insecure while feeling insecure.

UgzVyDNp6uxGNpnp7aB4AaABAg,VanguardSupreme,1377701186876,"Depends on who you're telling. 

If you're telling your construction worker friend whom you drink with on weekends that yeah! he should totally run for president, then that's probably imprudent. But people generally grow into being average, consequentially become aware of their limitations, and adjust their expectations accordingly. For kids, however, the sky's the limit (for the most part) and I see no reason to tell them otherwise."

Ugzpa-zMTnDxdZDVQiF4AaABAg,Kevin Grow,1377701186944,"yeah i'm glad she spent a good amount of time talking about minorities and white privilege (although, i wish the talk could've been longer). the reason i was concerned about her ability to switch careers into politics (as an example) it not because of the career itself, but the reason she would be restricted from entering that career. or, the reason people consider her unsuitable for that career.

i mean to say, why do beautiful white women seem so stupid and incompetent to so many people?"

It doesn't seem hard to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when a person is a walking example of the halo effect. She also said she is insecure.

The ones which are 'far' off from the 'perfect' image have to proof more (the black and latino example). The ones that fit okay have to overcome less, and the perfect look is expected to just be pretty (the president example).

Listening and commenting on the quality of her talk is 'the correct answer', you 'ignore' her looks. I think it's a known yet still important message, but poorly conveyed."

UgzAvfYbMPerswgoMsF4AaABAg,Flipped Over Productions,1377701199420,"She's incredibly attractive either way.  I find it hard to respect people this beautiful because they don't have a clue what its like to be ugly.  They think they do, because they may have a poor self image, but they don't.  When you're actually unattractive you get treated much differently than when you think you're unattractive, but have been a model for ten years.  Life is easier when you're pretty.  Like Tosh says, ""being an ugly woman is like being a man, you're going to have to work."""
Ugxo2_HzI3-PvUJxJzV4AaABAg,tdreamgmail,1377701199431,"Nope, you're still hot.  It didn't work.  Why you think most designers dress their models in bin bags?  She's a hipster model.  I hate being stereotyped as being beautiful but still enjoy all the benefits conferred by genetics.  If she really wanted to change how people looked at her, she should start doing meth for a few months, lose her job, and try to get employed not on the basis of her looks.  Talk, as they say, is cheap."

When she says only 2 models were non-white, when you include Europe and the US that's about the right ratio for representation.  Just American, it would have to be like 4-6 of 30.  As society changes more, the ratio of non-White to White models will increase, trust me.  Of course there will be delay, but it will increase."

By your logic, as long as other countries are worse, we don't need to worry about it. Let China worry about China and the U.S worry about the U.S."

UgzSnyb4v-2LcdDnj-R4AaABAg,Chris Flew,1377701239257,Following your logic would imply that the modelling community is naturally white dominated. There's no reason why that should be the case.

You seem to be saying that there are more extreme examples of the statistic she showed.

If it were all (or mostly) white as a nation, it wouldn't be a problem that only 4% of models were non-white, but the U.S. is in fact 27% non-white as a whole.

Although herself, and many others, have been beneficiaries of the current model of the social world, which is vastly based on superficialities, it does not guarantee felicity. It may be easier to find a job as a result of image, but we need to break away from these human constructs that so often cause cleavages in society. The quicker we acknowledge the superficiality and act accordingly, the better."
Ugy6v3wYUPzkTvlevsJ4AaABAg,Suertsje,1377701276074,"""These pictures are not pictures of me, they are constructions. And they are constructions by a group of professionals: By hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production their they build this, that's not me.""  ^_^"
UgyEYp2tPZgRKfZwXPp4AaABAg,mikeydapilot,1377701276083,"Since when is TED onlu about science? Sure, there are great presentations about new innovations and technologies, but there are also great talks about more personal incites and experiences that many people don't always understand. Way to be closed-minded."

UgxsZ7pieZkGvXvpzAt4AaABAg,Suertsje,1377701277759,"""Saying you want to be a modelwhen you grow up is akin to saying you want to win the powerball(? lottery) when you grow up. It's out of your controle, and it's awesome and it's not a career path."" ^_^ nice"

UgxyAsweRUy1gxdWVV94AaABAg,Girish Chandra Ananthanarayana,1377701277806,"Not the greatest talk but a pretty good talk. She provided a perspective that questioned some of the prejudices I had about models and modeling. I did not expect a standing ovation but worthy of a good round of applause for having the guts to talk about insecurities and other subtle aspects of a supposed glamorous lifestyle. As someone said before, a good perspective for those considering modeling as an option. Good one Cameron."
Ugy3yf_aplAjzkVt00R4AaABAg,ZZzzzzzWhat,1377701277819,"btw, i never said she was racist"
UgxEX48XAg_MEXywDVN4AaABAg,JohnPavilonis,1377701277828,Wonderful talk!
Ugz2V88GcIZutWQpVLN4AaABAg,hanna0240,1377701277837,She's right :)
UgxyyxtBtwWpaQrgsXB4AaABAg,ZZzzzzzWhat,1377701277841,"how was my comment racist? 
she's the one who mentioned that darker skin women have less chances to get in the modelling career. What i meant with my comment was this all seems like 'pretty talk' and i doubt that she would fix this injustice (give her place to the less privileged women) if she had the chance to."
Ugxohvle0uuWxKVXEbF4AaABAg,ScottishAtheist,1377701277851,"Boo hoo I'm gorgeous. This talk was all over the place and had no focus. It started badly with her ineffective appearance change; a better approach would have been if she had come out looking like a goofy nerd and then did a gotcha moment. Then it carried on to moaning about a privileged career? 
Cry me a river of crocodile tears. Take the benefits and shut up. No one cares that you feel sad inside for the black men in jail or the lack of ethnic models. 
Less crap like this in future please TED."
Ugy00_vIBXBrH5PZnM94AaABAg,rich64bit,1377701277855,I think the whole point of the talk was not about her lottery but her insecurities in a cut-throat industry
UgxokqmhJA_RRICOrxx4AaABAg,friebender,1377701277866,"What? Dude ideas are ideas, somtimes they are better sometimes they not, but they all have in comman, that they have value. 
Just because a idea doesn't have value for you, doesn't mean it isn't from value for another person.
Be happy there is such a awsome channel."
UgzZlTHWQFZ9tPpHoax4AaABAg,CryHavoc,1377701277873,"The fact that you instantly jump to such an assumption shows that you are racist, not her."

UgyEeeJi_o-HyLKAHk94AaABAg,CitizenofDystopia,1377701277888,"The transformation was true. As a man, she went from this hot barbie doll I wanted to see to this woman, still beautiful and attractive, that was appropriately dressed for a talk instead of a fashion show. Most of us know that the fashion industry works the way she does and that she's reaped benefits of being ""legacy,"" but the power of the talk falls on the fact that very few people in those shoes are willing to admit that publicly."
UgwCFSgXzczAUSV2i1l4AaABAg,cameron wintersgill,1377701277898,amazing and honest talk
UgwzJl9tNLOIggD_s014AaABAg,ZZzzzzzWhat,1377701277903,"typical ""don't hate the player, hate the game"". The question is, would she give her place in modeling to a darker skin women if she had the chance, i don't think so."

UgxczmQESlA9pv1qVA54AaABAg,Wrath of Math,1377701278925,she was referring to the transition from powerful to superficial. not sure what is stupid about truth and honesty.
