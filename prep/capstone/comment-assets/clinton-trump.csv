The liberals, leftists, and Democrats use them as mascots to further their own selfish political agenda and then do nothing to help them or improve their neighborhoods and lives.  They are so filled with hypocrisy using minorities to gain support and then dumping them like the morning trash when they win.  
Conservatives and Republicans do a better job because firstly, they don't make ridiculous unkeepable promises to minorities, but what promises they do make they keep.  However too many conservatives are racist and make no pretense about this, Donald Trump included.  Black Americans are some the the greatest and strongest Republicans, conservatives, and Christians in this country, and yet too many white conservatives do not welcome them as the allies they are and can be.  As a white male conservative myself, I encourage others to see the ally in our black American conservative counterparts.  We really need to be working more closely together and as white conservatives, cutting down on the racism in our own lives."

UgzTyTVOKnGqy3ekJn14AaABAg,James Love,1532464767893,"Trump won all 3 debates. Proof? Flipped multiple blue states. Proof? Trump got his message to the voter. Trump repeated his message and drove it home. Everyone knew what Trump was about going into the election. The end of TPP, trade renegotiation,  NAFTA, wall,  bringing manufacturing jobs back, and doing what it takes to keep jobs in America. Not one Clinton supporter  held a sign about an issue. Every Trump supporter had a reason to get off the coach and go vote. People would wait 4 hours to hear Trump speak after an 4 hour drive, they spent 10 minutes to vote. 

Jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs.  Trump used inception. Inception is not just a movie, it is a theory. Trump planted a very simple idea into people's minds. Make America Great Again and he painted the picture with Americans going back to work and making America great. Layer by layer Trump paints the picture of how it gets done. The blue collar worker regardless of how informed can go outside and see the closed factories then imagine how Trump will bring it back.

Clinton advertised her website. Clinton's website says, ""I'm, with her."" How is that a  positive message for men put out of work? It is not. Clinton alienates people. Clinton is not selling a plan of action or pushing a plan. ""Trumped up trickle down,""  is a silly attack, 1) it advertises Trump 2) takes a minute to think about what she means by that especially for voters who aren't familiar with ""Reaganomics"" 3) doesn't rhyme or roll off the tongue well. People can say MAGA, easy to say, lots of As that roll well. 

Trump is far more charismatic and persuasive. 100 years from now people will look at these 3 debates and see a master crafting his art. 

The VP debate is another good example to look at as well. Pence kept his dignity and Kaine looked like a clown, I don't like Pence and think he was a terrible Governor,  yet that debate had me thinking, ""this guy has dignity and honor.""  Standard politicians who aren't very good at selling a message or a policy should look at that debate and present themselves like Pence. Kaine is the opposite of what to do, he came off as rude and childish.  Voting is an act of responsibility, voters don't identify with Kaine. This was another major blow to Clinton's campaign campaign.

Trump 4 to 0 Clinton in debates. Clinton lost the election in these debates."

UgjCS80BeXOTqngCoAEC,Todd Sands,1503348082160,"Trump mentioned that the African American community has been let down by our politicians. Trump is most likely right. The differences is that opponents did not like hearing those words from his mouth. And HIllary mentioned that Bias is a systemic and national problem in our country which is true also. I did not watch this debate live. Although most¬†political experts deemed Hillary the winner from this debate, this 1st debate seemed to be much more civil than the 2nd and 3rd debates. Both candidates spoke well on some¬†topics in regards to police training &¬†racial bias. They weren't actually going at each other's throats on those topics.¬†Trump had major points about government instability. He did nail it in regards to the costs and charging of spending. When I was in the Army, I had to perform something called¬†PMCS checks on a Humvee assigned to me. And it nearly took a year and a half to receive the chains ordered for the hummer assigned to me. I and my fellow soldiers would scratch¬†our heads¬†on why something so mundane as chains for tires took so long to order? There could have been other factors too such as leadership above us dragging their feet within our ""chain of command"" submitting the order. Trust me when I say this, I'm proud to be a veteran in the US Army, but at least the Army that I was assigned to often did not get the job done in an expedient manner. I'm just telling it like it is. I'm sure other branches of service may have similar experiences about the virtual bureaucratic red tape that exists within all forms of the military and federal government. Our leadership could have thrown money together in a pot and bought chains at a local auto parts store for some tires needed to complete our inventories. But that was of course considered¬†illegal because the chains that the government must¬†approve of all certified parts and must go through proper channels. Which is agreeable. But again, there is no excuse that such a mundane part should have taken so long to order. Just my two cents on some of us in the military feeling the brunt of government inefficiency at that time. I'm sure¬†there are still problems¬†within all forms of federal spending."

UggrHCwnr40sangCoAEC,Tiffany Jung,1503348084379,"Everyone's so worried about Donald Trump causing another world war with some other country, but seeing that him and Putin are on friendly terms, there's a very unlikely chance that a nuclear war or a similar war decades ago will reoccur. That's how I see it right now. And if in fact a war does break out, then it won't be a problem for America, taking in consideration about how advanced our military technology is and our allies, which are superpowers in this world. Trump is a bully and bigot. His behavior is at times unacceptable, and I dislike how he expresses his ideas. However, I believe, as a Republican and a Christian, that his campaign is not outrageous nor is it worse than Clinton's. He is also very clean when it comes to politics because he has no previous affiliations with politicians. However, being a main factor is why people voted for Clinton, her extensive background in politics makes her more vulnerable to having to put interest to her 'fellow' politicians if she won the election. Her lies would become bigger and bigger, just like her email issues. Her view on social issues clash greatly with mine, and I think that was a major factor in the reasoning of why I support Trump. These days, social issues are a huge deal to many people and the sensitivity to it has increased dramatically. Although Trump is a man who was never affiliated with politics/military and is solely a business man, you could obviously tell by the results of this election that he prudently calculated the probability of him winning, which was a main reason in his decision to run. Also, many people claim Trump is 'gay'. Seeing that a) they insult him based on his sexuality or made-up sexuality b) they look down on him because of how is reported to be 'gay', they aren't fit to be a supporter of both the Democrat or Republican side. These hypocrites (Clinton supporters) who slam him down because they think he is homosexual is going against what the Democrats sought for: accepting everyone, whether or not they're gay or lesbian, transgender, a minority or Caucasian, etc.. These sorts of nonsense commentary about him and his personal life doesn't affect anyone, but just degrades the anonymous users behind these computer screens because of their seemingly uneducated background by using that type of diction. I think I covered most of the reasons why I support Trump and his campaign to #makeamericagreatagain. I hope those who read this will respect my opinion, and will take it into consideration before talking smack about Trump again. Thank you and let's see what America has in store for everyone. Good night."

Ugg_w5ZqroK7ongCoAEC,devilzwishbone2013,1503348096030,"Hi im British 
I have been listening to this whilst working and some problems im picking up with Trump
Is that is very vague in his answers leaving it open to perception and people can set them selves up to a false outcome

One thing im noticing his on about slashing taxes, but then his on about policing the streets with stop and search

Taxes help pay for public services (Well thats how it works in the UK, and I would imagine its the same if not similar in the US) so how do you reduce the government income to then say hey, we now going to milk the pot by putting police on the streets doing stop and searches) which risks segregation.

You have this strerotype that black men from ""Hoods"" or poor neighborhoods are heavily involved in armed crime (such as the cribs vs bloods) now I am not saying every black male does this so please dont twist my words, but I am saying if this stereotype exists you will get a lot of people being unnecessarily frisked, this will cause people to feel oppressed by the police and where this is still fresh in the black community specially since they havent let the whole Rodney King incident lie and that was over 25 yrs ago, 

Whilst previously I was a trump supporter just out of ludicracy and seing a change
If i was to be serious for a moment, I feel trump will be negative for the US

Not saying Hilliary is perfect look at the Email scandal, but she has the mannerism is more professional and more suited to the role that Trump, its just a shame its boiled down to therse two canditates for the US,

Some may argue whats it to do with the UK.
The USA is a powerhouse, its one of the largest bodies and influencial countries in the world and a lot of political decisions that take place in the US eventually affect other countries

I dont think it will be as dramatic as some people make out when interviewing the general public on the news, there will always be advisors the president has and the last thing you want is to anger the people you serve as they can turn on you, history shows this

Presidents have been known to have been assasenated, so i dont think for a moment it will cause the end of the world, but i dont think some of their decisions wont be detrimental to people ie Wars in syria or russia with no fly zones, or breaking the american bank and make america fall into further debt, poverty, crime will increase etc and wars can break out between other countries such as Mexico and its alies

Not sure if it would play out like that but I guess we will find out after tonight"

 Our society is rife with corruption, so much that we do not have the 
stomach or resolve to make the simplest of changes. We've already got 
plenty of fine ideas and solutions - but we can't act on them 
effectively. For one, our sovereignty was severely damaged with the creation of the 
Fed and The Great Depression (95+% of our gold was mandated by law to 
sell to foreign gold market-flippers in the 1930s - and afaik fort knox 
has not been audited since, amongst a multitude of other tragedies) . 
 T-Rump is an egotist and a bullshitter extraordinaire that's winging it
 on 9 of every 10 talking points... while Shillary's transgressions are

to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of the candidates and don't  misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years for that to happen PLEASE don't vote for her.

When the freedoms that Americans have enjoyed and now take for granted these fiascos happen. St a recent election in my small suburb of approximately 20,000. 900 people turned out to vote on local matters. city council, milages etc. Then all 20,000 complained at the results. We are very young country. less than 250 years old. And this sickness cthat has set in in America is sickness that is best to have when your still young. We have to learn that can no longer rely on our system to filter out laws, politicians etc. we sit blind to in there birthing phase then wonder how all this happened. A democracy is no better than the values of the people. America will survive this mess and hopefully learn from it. How many of us go or have ever gone to a city council meeting? We vote for drain commissioner. How many know what a drain commissioner is let alone qualifications? If we choose to ignore or system of govt. then it's participants will always have the final say. It is what it is. Nothing we can do about the past. But, with this election as a reminder, maybe we can help our future."

America will stand with its allies and end the Obama-Clinton practice of apologizing to our enemies.
Ugies3zGTbiVxHgCoAEC,Rebecca Cole,1503348179860,"This is why I'm for Johnson! Let him debate! Before you come at me with Aleppo, remember the missing e-mails on Hillary's side and Trump's 'locker room' talk. Before you say how he blanked and couldn't name a foreign leader, remember Trump's missing tax returns and Hillary defending a child who was raped. Every candidate has flaws. Obviously Johnson will not win, but that's not why I'm voting for him. I'm voting for him to send a message! I want actual candidates to vote for!

Hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are unrealistic. Higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the value of the US dollar to go down. Minimum wage is just that! Minimum wage, it's for entry level positions such as fast food. You will see higher pay if you actually applied yourself. So sit your whining asses down! You're not looking or applying yourself hard enough! Quit trying to get everything handed to you! Debt free college is unrealistic. I don't want my tax money to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were educated. That's unrealistic, which removes Jill Stein from the equation.

Trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the America we have today. Maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. He sounds like a complete idiot. He'll run America like a business and not like a country. 

That's my opinion (as a current college student working a part-time job which technically is on minimum wage but + tips)."

No one here even knows what nafta or the trans pacific partnership is or how much it has stolen money from the average american and funneled it to the top. People seem to 'THINK' that Trump represents all that we don't like about republicans. But you people forget that he isn't a career politician it's just the ticket he is on. Because they are misinformed about what has been going on for years but he actually isn't in bed with nearly as many people as Clinton is. Yes words are said and the media doesn't miss a thing but any person worth their salt has stirred the pot. The 1950s was the high watermark of the american economy anyone who did well was able to afford their own home and have access to a quality of life that every human being should be entitled to.

The Antichrist has shocking power inside him to keep peaple alive wile torchoring peaple for years and to give Youth to anyone. The Antichrist can remove Deadly illeness out of anyone and give it to anyone. Antichrist is very evil and i think you all know why? Who is the devil? Hint? What power in the Devil is possable in the years of the Antichrist. They can do anything and i am not kidding around they can walk through walls stand around were you cannot see them. Home privacy is invaded in mean manners you are being watched in the bathroom at home in your bedroom at home. Your being laughed at! The Royals are not so nice and not anymore. There is allot more to this power. The Queen goes out in public looking normal and in secret privacy not even peaple that work for her knows. There could be a few workers that have agreed the secret or elce.  She looks young with her Husband. She is way different looking than her young adult years. We are talking bigger Breast and a body women dream about. The other Royals have taken some of these powers to secretly look better to advance there looks. They were given energy to stay awake at all hours of the night also. The Antichrist can here peaple in the worlds thinking. There know what you think at all times the Queen also took that on With her Husband. They think evil thoughts about the peaple in the world along with this Antichrist. The Antichrist has been here for years and be honest with yourselfs and ask yourself when was this mark given to you years ago. Do anyone of you remember a strange males voice in your homes asking you if you were a christian?! That was the Antichrist. He would keep asking until you gave a awnser and it made you scared maby, confused maby. When you said no that you were not a Christian, Guess what? You got marked by Satan from the Antichrist. It happend! They did this to the world quick and sneaky for most peaple in the world. The high power leaders communicate with him. The world is now a sick evil joke and some of the High power leaders is in pretend mode with humans with some stuff they do. There lives are easy in ways and they live off powers to have more fun it's like better than a fairytail for them. our leaders are pulling your chain now! They will always make things look normal in front of your faces and your hearing. They gave Vanity and great bodies to certain peaple and we are talking major Vanity here. Satan is evil in Vanity issues and it happend through the Antichrist! There was a deal made with these select high power peaple from the Antichrist and he gave them this Vanity and energy and knowledge more than anyone could understand. They are up wile the world sleeps! They trully don't care about you. It is not just the peaple torchoring that they hate it is everyone in the world. They care for there family but there not so concerned about you. The Antichrist Hates all Human peaple in this world!

1) I think there should be some other candidate for President. It sounded both were just roasting each other. 
Instead of talking about the country they are just talking about each other.
2) Plans of trump like cutting Tax is very good. Because in long run this will work if we study this 
system properly, it answers itself. Because cutting tax will get jobs back and addition to few more plans that will
bring more jobs, makes it perfect. Even though Hillary thinks other way round pointing towards middle class but 
the number of jobs it will make is less than the jobs that will be lost. Also cutting tax to wealthy class or 
business people should come with constraints of employment to automatically concentrate on the whole countries 
financial issue and employment. Also investments and concentration on Research and development, innovation and small 
business will lead to increase in employment.
3) Race Question: It can be done by giving equal opportunities to all races and legally taking action against 
those who discriminate. And create a community, having all races as employees in every sector, who will manage all the 
complaints related to race, which will be answered directly by the President and will run independently. And this community 
should be easily accessible. Educational system should also be targeted to teach kids to help remove race discrimination. 
Because the knowledge and habits at the early age is more effective. Problem of races is problem of all countries so the 
above things I mentioned is good at Presidential level but this is actual work of everyone of us.

This is just my opinion!"

Ugj-rr2rbDq_YngCoAEC,seeingeye,1503348238010,"I see our friend Bill gates comments from Hong Kong.    Why is he there?  Because he doesn't want to pay the outrageous taxes of the liberal government he supported.   Microsoft still produces an inferior product, I'm glad they don't make planes, it would give the word crash a whole new meaning.  You can't make a patch for that Bill.
Now to the candidates:  
 Politicians lie, it's just a fact of life, what all you Hillary supporters need to accept is her lying started years ago at the Rose Law Firm and has escalated ever since.  She can't help but lie, if she told the truth she would be in prison where she belongs if for no other reason than Benghazi.  Good God, people were murdered over there due to her incompetence and negligence.  She publicly said after it was over when asked about the deaths her response was ""what difference does it make now"".  Ask the widows and fatherless children if it matters.   She is an absolute disgrace.  
You may not like Trump but I doubt very much if he was in the oval office for 8 years he would rack up more debt than in all the other Presidents in the history of the United States combined,  which is what your golden boy Obama did.   Check the numbers over 200 years of debt exceed in 8.  He should be in prison as well.   And don't even even try calling me  a racist he would still be an idiot if he where green and came from Mars.  Guess what I like Ben Carson and he's black, so shut-up with your race card BS.
You liberals that think the socialist European system is so great should move there, see how you like 60 and 70% tax rates.  The countries over there are broke from ridiculous social programs that support the lazy. To make matters worse they want the few countries that aren't bankrupt, like Germany for example, to bail them out, which is what politicians want the middle class to do.  But then again the middle class is all but destroyed thanks to Obama.  When you take more and more money from people who work and give more and more to people who don't you will eventually run out of workers and money and then the whole thing collapses. 
God bless America and God help America if we believe this socialist brain washing."

I will decrease taxes on the lower and middle classes as well as giving trade incentives to overseas businesses to set up shop here. I will take a no-nonsense approach to any government agencies foreign or domestic in creating terrorist organizations. I will increase funding to public schools for long term education and economy boosts that will more than likely really kick into action after my presidency. I will decrease federal interference in most things that should be state regulated. I will do whatever is needed to return the United States to the economic and industrial giant of post WW2. I'll take a page from my competitor Mr. Trump, let us make America great again, TOGETHER! p.s. for ISIS I'll stop funding to them through blockades and foreign assistance through diplomacy.

It's a scam, plain and simple; yet barely anyone sees it or even questions it.

But the #1 problem is people. People can't get on the same page about what is good and right in the first place. So many evil people act like they believe they have and are doing what is good and right. So this is pretty much all pointless and a waste of time (except to prove how stupid things are) until a group of people get together, dig deeper to discover the core issues of our problems, in order to start being real about what is really going on and why.

UggtbmQOtgLLvngCoAEC,madzangels,1503348273672,"To the citizens of the United States of America,
In the light of your consistent failure to elect a competent or worthy¬†President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable¬†Theresa May¬†MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:
1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour', skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix ""ize"" will be replaced by the suffix ""ise"". You will learn that the suffix 'burgh is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to respell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. When you learn to develop your vocabulary then you won't have to use bad language as often.
2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of ""-ize"".
3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to Cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents - Scottish dramas such as ""Taggart"" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles. While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon"". If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.
4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters. British sit-coms such as ""Men Behaving Badly"" or ""Red Dwarf"" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness.
5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.
6. You should stop playing American ""football"". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2050. You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders"" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs. 
7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 97.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. ""Merde"" is French for ""5hit"". You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.
8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".
9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.
10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian though 97.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called ""crisps"". Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer. Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.
11. As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.12. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all, it is lager. From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer"", and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as ""Lager"". The substances formerly known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Knat's Urine"", with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as ""Weak Near-Frozen Knat's Urine"". This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.13. From November¬†28th ¬†the UK will harmonise petrol (or ""Gasoline"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2017) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol prices (roughly $8/US gallon - get used to it).
14. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you‚Äôre not grown up enough to handle a gun.
15. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.
Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).
Thank you for your cooperation, on behalf of the people of the United Kingdom and her Majesty's Government."

First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, ""10101000101"", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. 
So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

Trump has no idea what the  laws are. He says so many things he will do that are not only unhinged, but illegal. Hillary was correct; he is not fit for office.

He rambled and ranted for 90 minutes, and showed himself to be the least presidential candidate in history. Bizarre.

The Republicans are finished as a party of power, and they only have  themselves to blame for selecting such an unfit candidate.

thats easy going and I would not mind her being in charge but at the

3¬†And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.

5¬†Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,

6¬†And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

7¬†Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

8¬†Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

9¬†And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

10¬†Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

People's priorities are messed up, thinking his character is more important than the issues. Obama made America worse, and Hillary will follow. Who cares about getting a degree, if you can't find¬†a job after you graduate. Look at how many people are on food stamps and other government benefits; you really feel America is doing better? Everyone is working minimum wage with Masters degree. Trump knows how to change this, as Hillary will make it worse. People are going after how he had ""locker talk"" and etc. as Bill Clinton's affair was made publicized when he was in the office, so come on with that. Everyone needs to wake up and think of¬†what matters. Also, just look back at when Hillary was running against Obama in 2008. Another thing that kept coming up is Trumps tax returns. Did he do anything illegal? Then who cares? Who doesn't want to pay less? He's a business man. This debate wasn't fair because Trump basically spent the time defending himself with things that just don't matter, with not only Hillary, mind you. Where were Hillary's follow up questions? That's right,¬†she didn't have any, because heaven forbid she go off her script.¬†Also, about Obama's birth certificate... are they not supposed to check to see if the person running for president in America is in fact American? Get off this.¬†Does it matter?¬†I rather vote for someone I at¬†least respect the ideas of, and is real. Hillary¬†I will never respect as a smart or strong woman.One last thing, for people who think that Republicans are just red neck hillbillies, who do you think are the majority¬†on food stamps and wishes for the government to care for them? Not the Republican party... Think about it.¬†¬†Trump 2016."

Trump's proposal would exploit the working class. The working class makes up a greater percentage of our population. Clinton is right in this. I agree with her on that we should focus on the middle class, but her plan and strategies? I doubt they would work in the long run. Increasing minimum wage is only a band-aid.

I think there's already cyber securities and intelligent
some time they say in the news that there's a terrorist attack by a specific terrorist group or ISIS now a days  how did they know that it's from ISIS somebody must'v been saying something so why they don't get interrogated with who and where. or the news all just lies these days working for the governments propaganda  

1:11:30 Hillary speech
""we want to squeeze ISIS in Syria""
well let me say:
 what does Syria have to do with that? more trouble making in Syria and then do you want to Enter Syria without permission from the current president Bashar Alasad 
honestly I hope you cooperate with him because he didn't give up his country for chaos exactly just like the Turkish president did but the Turkish president had an instant perfect execution of bringing peace back maybe when you cooperate with Syria and the other middle eastern countries it would build a good strategic ally to exterminate ISIS without the sacrifices and the bloodshed over the the last years in the middle east and start building decent living for these countries that suffered too much from bad politicians I heard president Bashar speech before Isreal war on Lebanon he said if we left Israel going to start a war and that what happens after that Isreal lost the war and they started making the problems in Syria and the interfering of it's national security ..

1:24:00 Hillary speech until 1:25:00
well that's my replay on what Hilary said:
I'm from Saudi Arabia I'm just a normal citizen but I don't think it's appropriate to say this about my country or do u consider Saudi Arabia and other mentioned nations terrorist countries that want nuclear weapons?
as for the nuclear energy might need it for technology development or if there's a alternative safer way to produce energy like Magnet maybe I don't know why not...
I don't think any country should have or use nuclear weapons especially america they are the one who created it and used it 
and if any country used it NATO should be against it by force.

1:25:00 Donald speech until 1:26:20 ""Lester Holt"""" WE NEED TO MOVE ON and he continue the same subject on 1:33:30
well my replay on what Donald Said:

1st able we don't need your protection on behalf of every nation.

the winner is Hilary then Donald

I think the most important thing is to keep the peace and don't criticise others the world become open thanks to the technologies from USA and across the globe as many bad politicians and governments mistakes the world is going just great at the moment for all nations except the poor countries and countries under wars I hope you can do something about that politically and not by making another wars peoples lives is not cheaper than money and we need moral awareness in everything we do in life.

It's a totally different world now. Trump represents what America used to but sadly that America doesn't exist anymore and is dying out. There are still many die hard real Americans who care and love this country but there aren't enough of them anymore;; Hillary will be the next president because that is who the establishment has chosen long before this election has started just like they chose Obama. It's a shame but all good things have to come to an end i guess. America used to be great but it's a total corrupt country now run by Liberals who are really destroying this country. SAD

This is not an episode of The Apprentice  where he gets to talk over people as he chooses and his word is the final word.  I am Black, I'm female and I was born,  raised and live in Chicago, I right here in the middle of it and I don't have to listen to his BS, I know exactly what the truths are and I know from his own words what he thinks about ""the Blacks"", women and Chicago. I appreciatei the conversation but before you start chastising people for telling the truth about Donald, maybe you should stop assuming that they are wearing Clinton tee-shirts."

Republicans have a bad reputation because the media and powerful entities are trying to flush them out. 
Donald Trump is a real person and I see that in Pence too. Trump is somewhere in the middle of democrat republican (as we all should be). He used to be a democrat and then he woke up to the reality that his party was pushing global initiatives like Global Warming which was debunked and changed back to Climate Change. Nobody denies Climate Change is real (not even trump) there are however Global Warming deniers and rightfully so. It is a scare tactic that the United Nations tries to bounce around every ten years or so. Another global initiative Dems are in support of is DEPOPULATION (yes I said it!). Why do you think they are so for abortion (even late term) with no reason other than I dont want a baby right no or destroy my vagina. (Thats what birth control and condoms are for) (and bitch your vagina is already flabbergasted if you are getting knocked up at random). I'm pro -life to the extent that the woman's health wouldn't be jeopardized and of course rape or incest. 
We as Americans have been fooled for quite some time. I voted for Obama, but like Trump I woke up 3 years ago to the realities that a lot of people are still blind to. Unless we get someone like Trump who uses common sense to handle the issues we face and challenge the government that is corrupted and become a system that fools and confuses it's people rather than one FOR THE PEOPLE. America as we know it will be no more. 

Hillarys world:
Hand over your guns, congratulate your daughters on their first abortions, send your kids to school  in your driver-less car to learn how to have gay sex, then take a bunch of drugs that you see advertised on TV and die as soon as possible so that the earth doesn't boil over with global warming and there no place left for the elite to live."

TPP is bad too and Hillary would approve it and she is wrong too. They both suck. I only agree with a few things. trickle down does not work. We tried it, it failed. despite the lower taxes they are not creating good paying jobs. The only way to pay off our debt is to tax corporations, they have all the money. the poor. low wage average Americans don't have the incomes to collect enough taxes. But you can give tax breaks and incentives to create good paying jobs. then get more tax revenue by increasing wages."

She will sell out this great country and all the people in it in the blink of an eye if it suits her purpose.

Taxes are a form income that the government can use for investment, subsidies and etc. I love the idea for free education but it cannot be done without money. Tax is also a form of control and to discourage certain market activities. From trumps point, businesses would rather save more else where which is true as they would want to maximize profit. But Trump fail to realize that lowering taxes for the rich will reduce the amount of government is making for using it to benefit for society. So when prices go up, people will automatically spend less. thus money will not cycle around. Business will not be able to make money thus businesses will let off workers due to poor sales. So let off workers will save because of no job.These are one factors to cause the ressession. Plus Hillary is raising taxes on the rich and not for the middle and below classes. Donald is making it such that everyone is getting a tax rise. Hillary is getting affected by what Donald is saying and she went off track abit. Also the bias from trump side because he has business and it would affect him greatly. The form of greed is the cause of people like him to want to enjoy their form of lifestyle. The government is not taking half his pay but just a percentage of his income. Equality vs equity. Equity will benefit society if everyone is willing to share."

UgjASAQfPOHurHgCoAEC,Ekks K,1503348432930,"They both act like two children fighting over a game, the United States is a board game to both of them. Just watching this made me sick to my stomach. The way they go back and forth at each other. All that was missing is a mom yelling at them in the back ground to stop fighting. Trump the whole time was so busy trying to criticize Hillary, instead of trying to justify his ideas. Reason for this being is he can't. Trump spends so much time either criticizing Hillary, or repeating each and every question, then finally getting his idea out.You wait forever for him to stop beating around the bush. The reason for this is he truly doesn't have a clue how to handle struggling American families. He grew up rich, and has always been rich. He has no idea what it is like to struggle. But you can just tell he fears it. I personally think Trumps greatest fear is becoming poor. That is why he wants to run for president. To change laws for him and his family. He doesn't have the United States best interests at heart. But then you have Hillary, a ball of hot air. I did agree with trump when he said yep that sure sounds wonderful but will never happen. I like most her ideas, but she is digging herself into a hole. Honestly most her ideas in the end are going to effect everyone. They both are evil in a sense. One is lying her ass off just to win the board game. Telling us what we want to hear. And the other one doesn't care about anyone but his own personal selfish needs. Trump keeps going on about how China, and other countries are so much better off then we are. Well it's because they don't have children in control. And even if China is using the Us to  rebuild their country, as Trump said it's just business. He sure doesn't like it when others do to him what he does himself.And then you have the whole racist crap that lasts forever. Okay BOTH of them are talking about African American people like they are beneath them. Or pawns for their board game. Like look at me I love people of color pick me pick me! It's all laughable. What needs to happen is first off African American people need to shut up over slavery already. It doesn't matter what race you are, we have all been slaves at one point in time. It has always been wrong. But we need to let it go. What people of color don't seem to understand is by complaining about  slavery and being afraid of white cops etc.  All this bullshit going on. They are giving power to White people. It's like a pack of wolves. If the alpha sees your weak your going to end up at the bottom of the pack. With that being said certain white people thinking they are better cause they have white skin. Need to see a good shrink. We need to start off on a new leaf. College needs to be free for everyone. That is a (huge) problem. For every child that grew up in a below average household or even average. They're chances of getting to go to college are slim.  Denmark and other countries college is free. Come on us! Trump and Hillary are titting and tatting over bullshit. And avoiding all the real problems. LET COLLEGE BE FREE! We wonder why the U.S. has so many street gangs. People need to start using their minds for good use instead of bad. We were all born with beautiful minds.Why not start using them for good use. Let the children go to college and not just have dreams but get to keep them. Lets have trade schools too, for those who aren't wanting to go to college. Lets make it easier for people to own their own business. Money shouldn't even be a problem at this point in time. We should be past worrying about it. Honestly if I could be president everything would change. There would be no more countries because we would all be one. Regular schools, would change you would only have to go through to 8th grade. And then would have the choice to continue to college, or a trade school. Both college and trade Schools would be free. That would honestly make more kids want to stay in school, and keep them off the streets. There will always be people with more money then others. But I would make it so there would be no such thing is a low income family. Housing and land would be extremely cheap. Where anyone could afford it. People who could not work who have disabilities and note have doctors backing on it. Would be able to have a home and car paid for them. The house would only be as big as the family needed. But still to own your own home and vehicle instead of seeing so many homeless is a improvement. Look at how the U.S. for example treats veterans they fought for our country. To what end up being homeless? Or going hungry? Cause they can no longer handle a job. That is bullshit! They should be honored. The way I see it they should own there own home paid off and vehicle of they're choosing. And also have a card kinda like a EBt or credit card. That has no limit each month they would get money for food and whatever else. Also they should have a card where they would not have to pay for doctors visits or hospitals. What about all these old houses that could be fixed up really nicely. Plenty of homeless people could have a home. Every child should also be covered for doctors check ups and such for free. Dentist and so on should be more like Canada. Free dental. We also need to help out the farmers. And start having more honey bee farms. And this would apply to everyone around the world. A one country order. Take the good from each country. Remove the bad. No more worthless pointless wars anymore either. Why would anyone want to change it? Also if we are all one country there would be no need to fight against one another. Then there is the huge problem with religion that would come into play. Id have it so each and every one would have the right to have their faiths. Note as long as it isn't going to hurt anyone or anything. But sense we would be a open country if some one from a former country no longer wanted to be apart of it would no longer have to. If they so choose to. There would also be the problem with disease spread I am sure. But that problem is happening anyway. If we all banned together and everyone could get the treatment they needed in the end we would see less and less of a problem. If people in third world countries could have the shots medicines etc. Better hospitals they wouldn't be dying over everything.  A lot would have to change and I may sound off my rocker. But I think it would be a much better way of life for us all."

Separate from that observation I think there is a possibility that Trump's performance was terrible on purpose. He has so much ammo to use against Hillary but spent the whole time defending himself. Perhaps it was orchestrated so that all the good points will be saved for the last debate to which he will decimate Hillary.

UgiBDEd0lH_c33gCoAEC,HUED,1503348466674,"I see two options here:

1) A massive racial conflagration in which whites refuse to live in fear and defend their rights. A major political tide shift occurs with an emphasis on race realism and an increased understanding of humans' tribalistic nature. Society as we know it continues on with more free association and awareness of human tendencies, and by extension, there will be less racial tension. Everyone will be treated equally under the law and we will stop the phony obfuscation of equality by understanding that unequal outcomes are okay in a free society.

2) Whites continue down the current path of repeated concessions, kowtowing, and appeasement. We totally shirk our identity, culture, and achievements, using our IQ as a sort of mechanism to deny nature, in favor of the self-flagellative progressivism that has percolated through our society from academia and the media. Whites birth rates continue their decline and the whites left in the new majority brown society flee to other places in the world where whites have fled to already.

Option 2 may be a bit hyperbolic in that we don't know how long it will take for these demographic shifts to occur, but it should come to no surprise to anyone here that as whites lose their identity and pride, future white generations will realize what their forefathers hadn't: While whites lost their pride and culture and bowed down at the altar of postmodern-machinations and historical injustice to receive their lashings, other peoples remained just as tribalistic and prideful. They will realize the extent to which white civilization treated minorities with kindness, i.e. the opposite of their new minority experience."

FBI Director Comey Took Millions from Clinton Foundation Defense Contractor
 TIM BROWN ‚Äî SEPTEMBER 29, 2016
ShareTweetPlusEmailPrint

 
Is anyone surprised by this corruption? When FBI Director James Comey said that the organization would not be seeking to bring charges against Hillary Clinton over her illegal email server, anyone paying attention knew there was a deep level of corruption. Now, it's been made clear. James Comey received millions of dollars from the corrupt Clinton Foundation, and his brother's law firm also does the Clinton's taxes.

According to a letter sent by 200 Republicans who stated Clinton ""clearly placed our nation's secrets in peril,"" Comey was asked why he would not bring charges against her. ""No one is above the law, and the American people deserve a more robust explanation for your decision to not recommend criminal charges.""

MiniPlanet reports:

A review of FBI Director James Comey's professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader ‚Äî now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton ‚Äî is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships ‚Äî all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton ‚Äî reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.

These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey's former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner's board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation's taxes.
In the report, Comey is noted as receiving $6 million in one year along from Lockheed Martin, who is a Clinton Foundation donor, and became a donor in the same year Comey received those funds.

Additionally, Mr. Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings in 2013. HSBC has also partnered with The Clinton Foundation, where records indicate that the bank projected $1 billion in financing through the Clinton Foundation for ""retrofitting"" 1,500 to 2,000 housing units to conserve energy.


 
Additionally, Peter Comey, James' brother, serves as ""Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas"" for DLA Piper, according to the report.

DLA Piper is number five on Hillary Clinton's all-time career Top Contributors list. DLA also performed an independent audit of The Clinton Foundation in November.

So, is anyone else going to question the motives of FBI Director Comey when it comes to failing to call for charges against Hillary Clinton regarding her blatant disregard for the law, national security and the American people? I think not."

Hillary is the biggest flimflam artist in political history. I'm not saying Trump fits all presidential attributes.. i.e. spontaneously scripted talk, temper and poise however, he's not speaking out two sides of his mouth and he hasn't been perched in government positions for 30+ years. that's a long time to potentially press for change.. Only until now has Flimflam (Hillary) become a visionary for a better America. AND when provided the opportunity to enlighten us about her vision, she put all of it on the back burner to her priority of disparaging Trump.. FlimFlam's gaze is short and shallow."

Basically your country has been shooting itself in the food for the past 20 years since the approval of NAFTA and now soon the TPP. The special interests do not care about your country, they're just looking for a way to increase their wealth. The global economy does not rely on the dollar anymore, those days are over. Unlike the Nixon era when America was the most powerful, you can't keep on printing money or it will cause the financial bubble to implode. Unless you Americans do not quickly Implement a new policy which will eliminate the no deficit free trade agreement your country will be in serious trouble, only through import tax will you be able to pay off the 20 trillion dollar debt. This artificial economic recovery in the last few years has been nothing but a cheap attempt by the federal reserve to mend their wounds, while they are indeed trying to recover, it is only a matter of time before the country bleeds itself to death. You cannot afford to have 4 more years of an establishment puppet that has absolutely no brain nor control to turn away America from turmoil. Her criminal activities do not concern me, however it is pretty obvious how the FBI director Comey keeps covering her tracks it is plane obvious that she is guilty and anyone who thinks that she is innocent at this point are simply blinded by their hate for Trump and not for what she did or how she acts like she's above the law. But that's not what I a trying to explain here, what I'm trying to tell you is that this is not about her being a woman I frankly give 0 fucks what her gender is at this point. My concern is America and the suicidal path it will take if it keeps falling for the same establishment propaganda machine that it has been following for many years now. I don't know if you realize this but the American standard of living has been getting worse in comparison to 20 years ago and it will only keep going down unless your country actually pulls their heads out of their asses and stop treating this election like some popularity contest, rather than the salvation of your great nation, that will not be so great if Hillary wins."

Ughs3XNTVtypSngCoAEC,Lech Biegalski,1503348509096,"Neither Donald nor Hillary have mentioned what really needs to be done 
in order to make America great, again. Here it is:

1. Remove from politics and from influence on politics all unelected 
officials and organizations. Like Ronald Reagan, kick out of politics 
the neocons, if necessary, jail those who will be plotting against such 
decision;
 
2. Nationalize banks, especially the Fed. Government should be in charge
 of fiscal and monetary policies.
 
3. End speculation and corruption of the Wall Street. Economy should 
serve the people and not the other way around.
 
4. End our illegal wars for domination and resources and our meddling in
 internal affairs of other sovereign states. Brings the troops home. 
That's where they belong. (Donald has ""sort of"" mentioned it.)
 
5. End our unconditional support for criminal states like Saudi Arabia 
and Israel. End our support for terrorists used as proxies in order to 
destabilize other countries with the view of a regime change.
 
6. Arrest, jail, charge, and punish people for their actions, not for 
their color of skin. Police must be responsible and accountable for the 
use of force and weapons.
 
7. Do not relax government regulations - it leads to monopolization and 
to excessive price gouging, it destroys consumer protection, it is good 
for the business and the crooks, but bad for the people.
 
8. Make the corporations pay fair taxes for an opportunity to do 
business in this country - (Hillary has mentioned this but I am not 
sure, based on her past business dealings, if she would really implement
 it, if elected.)
 
9. Remove money from politics. Outlaw political lobbying. Assign equal 
time on major national media for the parties and candidates to present 
their programs and to have meaningful, positive and constructive 
debates.
 
10. Ban political propaganda in the media. Stop lying and manipulating 
public opinion. Stop destroying democracy, which should be based on the 
ability of the voters to make informed decisions and meaningful choices 
based on true information."

SO I AGREE WITH TRUMP WHEN HE SAYS THAT IN ORDER FOR THEM TO EXPAND HERE IN THE U.S. THEIR TAXES AND REGULATIONS HAVE TO BE DEMOLISHED SO THAT THEY ARE BUILDING HERE , CREATING JOBS HERE, PUTTING CONTROL BACK IN THEIR HANDS SO THAT THEY CAN STAY AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE PROSPERITY THAT WOULD LIKELY BRING TO MIDDLE CLASS AMERICA BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR COMPANIES TO EXPAND. ....THEY HAVE TO HIRE LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE!!!! TRUMP ALSO SAYS THAT IF THESE HUGE CORPORATIONS DO NOT WANT TO STAY HERE IN THE U.S. THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY HUGE TAX IN ORDER TO BRING THEIR PRODUCTS INTO OUR COUNTRY! !! SOUNDS GREAT WHEN I THINK OF IT THIS WAY.....SEEMS LIKE HIS PLAN MAY WORK. HILLARY SAYS THAT SHE WILL CREATE JOBS BY RAISING THE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. I MAY BE WRONG BUT DON'T WE ALL HEAR THIS SAME PLAN EVERY SINGLE TIME OUR COUNTRY ELECTS A NEW PRESIDENT? ?? WELL IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IF TAXES ARE RAISED ON THE WEALTHY. ....THEY NO LONGER CAN AFFORD TO EXPAND AND THEY LEAVE...BUT I WOULD LEAVE TOO BECAUSE THEY CAN BUILD SOMEWHERE ELSE AND STILL BRING THEIR PRODUCTS INTO THE U.S. AT NO COST.... THAT'S JUST GOOD BUSINESS! !! ALSO, I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO DISCUSS THIS AREA BECAUSE OF ONE REASON....MY PARENTS HAVE WORKED 80 OR MORE HOURS EVERY WEEK, 7 DAYS A WEEK, FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS BUILDING THEIR OWN  SMALL BUSINESSES!! I'M VERY PROUD OF THEIR DRIVE AND AMBITION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE  TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES!!! SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT?? SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY RIGHT??? WRONG....WRONG....WRONG! !!! DESPITE THEIR HARD WORK YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR 40 YEARS.....THEY ARE BACK AT SQUARE ONE BECAUSE OF THE REGULATIONS AND TAXES AND OBAMACARE.....NOW I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT HUGE CORPORATIONS.....I'M TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES BEING UNABLE TO EXPAND AND EVEN LOOSING MOST EVERYTHING......SO WHEN HILLARY SAYS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DOING WELL AND SHE WILL HELP US CONTINUE TO GROW......SHE'S A LIAR......SMALL BUSINESSES CANNOT SUSTAIN LET ALONE EXPAND.....AND NEW SMALL BUSINESSES CANNOT GET GOING BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS  AND MONEY IT COSTS TO EVEN SELL YOUR FIRST PRODUCT IS TOO MUCH AND OUT OF REACH!!

After listening a while you notice that there is no ""red thread"" to his vague rants. Nothing connects. He spent his entire debate actually saying nothing. It feels like he's all about creating a giant cloud of vagueness that every less intelligent listener can fill with whatever he or she thinks personally, so that they all can believe that trump believes what they believe. Regardless. 
And that's how you dupe almost an entire nation.  TA-DAW!

well I'm really
calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous
jobs they're going to expand their companies they're going to do a
tremendous job i'm getting rid of the carried interest provision and if you
really look it's not a tax
it's really not a great thing for the wealthy it's a great thing for
middle-class it's a great thing for companies to expand and when these
people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and
when they're going to bring two and a half trillion dollars back from overseas
where they can't bring the money back because politicians like Secretary
Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so
onerous and the bureaucratic red tape
so what is so bad so what they're doing is they're leaving our country and there
believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them
have lots of money outside of our country and instead of bringing it back
and putting the money to work because they can't work out a deal to and
everybody agrees it should be brought back instead of that they're leaving our
country too
get their money because they can't bring their money back into our country
because of bureaucratic red tape because they can get together because we have a
problem we have a president that can't sit them around the table and get them
to approve something and here's the thing Republicans and Democrats agree
that this should be done we've looked at York alright so there it is i think...

  That said, as both Clinton and Trump won't be too beneficial (in some cases even damaging) to the economy and political systems, I'd rather choose Clinton to ensure the US' slow but stable growth until the next election- when we can choose better candidates.

sent hand to face signals to Holt signifying interrupt Trump away from certain
important subjects. 2: A psychological expert trained Hillary to use
emotionally charged trigger words to put Trump on the defensive and to keep him
in this pattern of thinking, wasting his time and giving mere appearance that
Hillary was on the attack. 3. The Cleaner: A man at the end of the debate
picked up Hillary's notes. The Cleaner then held them at his side, standing
still. As Holt moved toward off stage, the Cleaner moved in Holt's direction
and as they passed the notes were smoothly exchanged between the two of them
seamlessly. Therefore, these (3) planned exchanges definitely suggest a rigged
debate. The next debate will not be free of rigging mechanisms in favor of
Hillary."

These (billionaires) are people in our country with enough global interdependence to benefit from our economic collapse. People with those kinds of assets can then buy up everything (your house) at rock bottom prices, and reset the economy with competitive wages. The average income in China is $5,000 per year, ten times less than America's $50,000, and yes this is after conversion. That's why he can't tell you what he plans to do. It appears that they have been trying to crash the economy. Right before he left office, Bush bailed out the banks for about 800 billion, then Obama, another 800 billion, that's 1.6 trillion. The republicans scream TOO MUCH SPENDING!!!! Obama get's out of the wars, QUICKLY. Wars with a price tag of right about 1.6 trillion over the previous eight years. Now Obama boasts eight years later, the economy is up 10%, right about 1.6 trillion. And they pass ""Citizens United"" a bill that allows politicians to receive 10 times more than before. And Donald Trumps says we need to get that 2 trillion dollars that American companies have oversees back into the country, but how are we going to get that 1.6 trillion that Obama and Bush printed out of the economy? This is a big deal. And for the Christian GOP constituency that got us in this mess, Read Ezekiel 19.

One of the country's two major political parties is on the verge of nominating a man unfit to be president ‚Äî and the lack of fitness is thoroughly comprehensive.
Donald Trump knows next to nothing about public policy. He is a serial, perhaps a certifiably pathological, liar. And an unapologetic misogynist. He actively encourages racial and ethnic animus, and conspiracy theories, and delights in egging on political violence, and in mocking the disabled. He regularly demonstrates contempt for established institutions of liberal democratic governance both domestically and globally. He has threatened to order the armed forces to engage in actions that would amount to war crimes. And advocated policies that would require government actions on the scale of a police state (the rounding up and deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants) and others that are almost certainly unconstitutional (a blanket ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States)."

We can hold the professional political class of this country accountable for the despicable things they say behind closed doors when they think nobody is listening.

In the leaked audio, Hillary at her fundraiser launches a huge insult to Bernie Sanders‚Äô mostly youthful supporters and millenials. Hillary casts them as ‚Äúliving in their parents‚Äô basement,‚Äù which you can hear in the audio below the story at the 24:45 mark. Hillary goes on to contend that many college graduates are frustrated that they are only able to get jobs as ‚Äúbaristas,‚Äù which is also a slam on the Obama Regime‚Äôs eight-year record of economic failure.

Also in the recording is another slam on Obamanomics. Hillary makes a clear attempt to explain what was in February still a Bernie Sanders phenomenon and admits that ‚ÄúAmericans haven‚Äôt had a raise for about 15 years,‚Äù she says at the 4-minute mark while acknowledging that ‚Äúpeople have not recovered from where they were before the Great Recession.‚Äù Note that this isn‚Äôt the stance that Hillary Clinton takes publicly."

His main bargaining chip is lowering taxes for the rich so that they keep their money in the country. It doesn't work. I know that for fact. 
One thing is that high achievers have already have the way of avoiding taxes so 15% 35% makes no difference for them they will not pay either. 
An other thing is wages. Even is they had lower taxes the wages they need to pay would be several times higher manufacturing at home instead of China or Mexico. 
Thirdly and most importantly look at the example of Hungary. The prime minister did exactly what Mr Trump proposes and it only made thing worse. Far worse in fact. The rich became super rich, the poor got to the edge of existence and the middle class almost entirely disappeared. As a result the inner stress grows, nationalism, antisemitism and racism is at record heights.  
Do not follow the Hungarian footsteps it leads to no good.

Mostly I see that the companies have become very irresponsible themselves in some of their own policies.  When no one realizes the relationship between high inflation without any type of income security in the form of wages, then you're bound to have tremendous losses.  What people also don't realize, with lower taxes on big business, the big business forgot about also improving job situations for those doing the work.  Their expenses become less with lowering taxes, but you don't just go on a greed growth and forget to also reward those workers now that your costs aren't as high.

Trump's policies are just the same old Republican trickle down economics:

- still more huge tax cuts for corporations and for billionaires like Trump and his friends

- abolish the EPA and eliminate all regulations that prevent corporations from polluting and from screwing you any way they wish, for more profits

- serve the fossil fuel industry by denying climate change

- having zero interest in overturning Citizens United and reforming the corrupt campaign finance system

- leave prisons and health care in the hands of private ""for profit""corporations



 By contrast, Hillary is leading the Dem Party, and it's only in the Dem party that you find a huge faction pushing for policies desperately needed by the middle class, including:

- overturning Citizens United and reforming the corrupt campaign finance system

- raising taxes on billionaires, and closing the loopholes that let corporations and billionaires evade taxes with offshore tax loopholes

- raising minimum wage to a living wage

- universal single payer heath care

- reforming the criminal justice system so that the U.S. does not continue to spend billions of dollars having the highest incarceration rate in the world, and one which disproportionately hurts blacks and Latino's

- making public colleges and universities tuition free for families under $125K, allowing students to refinance student loans to take advantage of lower interest rates, and getting government out of the business of profiting off student"

She got under his skin and he was on the defense. ATTENTION TRUMP!!!

I apologize to mrs clinton and to the american people. In the last debate, I let myself get side tracked and instead of discussing many important issues, much time was wasted on squabbling on things that have no bearing on the future of our nation.

It's time to repent before it's too late. Revelation 14:12 says that the saints are those that KEEP the commandments of God, not forget, change or ignore. Please get right with God.

1. Her healthcare plan led ground for the Affordable Healthcare Act, which, like it or not, has helped millions of Americans.¬† 2. She played a leading role in the development of the¬†State Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, which provides the much-needed aid¬†for children whose parents cannot afford to provide them with adequate healthcare coverage.¬† 3. She was instrumental in the creation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act.¬† 4.¬† Successfully fought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and asthma at the National Institute of Health (NIH).¬† 5.¬† She spearheaded investigations into mental illness plaguing veterans of the Gulf War, which we now call ""Gulf War Syndrome"".¬† 6.¬† At the Department of Justice, she helped create the office on Violence Against Women.¬† 7.¬† She was instrumental in securing over $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center redevelopment.¬† 8.¬† She took the lead in the investigation of health consequences of 9/11 first responders and drafted the first bill to compensate and offer the health services that our first responders deserve.¬† 9. Was also instrumental in working out a bi-partisan compromise to address civil liberty abuses for the renewal of the U.S. Patriot Act.¬† 10.¬† Proposed a revival of the New Deal-era Home Owners‚Äô Loan Corporation to help homeowners refinance their mortgages in the wake of the 2008 financial disaster.¬† 11.¬† Was a major proponent of sensible diplomacy which brought about a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel,and Burma.¬† 12.¬† Oversaw free trade agreements with our allies such as Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.¬† 13.¬† She helped expand health care and family leave for military families.¬† 14.¬† Was the most traveled Secretary of State to date, which translates to ""she got out and actually spoke with the people""!¬† 15. As secretary of state, Hillary made LGBT rights a focus of U.S. foreign policy. She lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and declared that ‚Äúgay rights are human rights.‚Äù And here at home, she made the State Department a better, fairer place for LGBT employees to work.¬† (On this note:¬† True,¬†Mrs. Clinton wasn't¬†for same-sex marriage in the beginning; even advocated against it.¬† Guess, what?¬† In my younger years, neither was I!¬† The idea of same-sex relationships made me very uncomfortable!¬† It made a lot of people uncomfortable!¬† Thank God enough of us¬†are not the closed-minded people that we once were, because we would be missing out on knowing millions¬†of wonderful and beautiful people!)In additional to these accomplishments as¬†Senator, The Clinton Foundation has improved the living conditions for nearly 400 million people in over 180 countries through its Initiative Program.¬†Her activism¬†on behalf of women and children across the world is renowned, and her fights¬†to¬†raise the minimum wage and combat climate change is stellar.¬† Her management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China, and her¬†efforts to create and implement the toughest sanctions ever on Iran, helped¬†lead us to the agreement currently on the table.

Also, on another feed before it started, Holt had trouble with his earpiece (is earpiece allowed?) and removed his suit. Throughout the entire debate, Hillary sounded way too scripted and rehearsed and was obviously reading a bunch of lines because she would always look down & wasn't able to form smooth sentences (eg. talking about African Americans & inner city). Also, I noted that at times during the debate, Hillary had some twitch in her index finger (maybe she was scrolling something to find a pre-written line to attack Trump with). At the end of the debate, when Clinton and Trump were going to go shake hands, I noticed a white, rectangular (screen?) that faded to black 1:38:37 - 1:38:40 ...nothing on Trump's podium. Finally, I noticed the same man with the white hair & glasses from the beginning go directly to her podium and take her notepad and other items underneath. When the Clinton Family were going around and waving to the crowd, a couple other people came to her podium to examine it and her team stood around to block the view so they could take a box or whatever it was. I watched the replays multiple times and that white hair guy at the end looked very suspicious and continued looking around him like he was not trying to get caught while going back and forth to her podium."

UgiFmdwARzVKAXgCoAEC,legorig,1503348663473,"On the topic of energy, while I do semi support Clinton, I have to say that Trump was partially right. 

Solar panels aren't really the best alternative, if you want to get serious about clean energy and fixing you energy problem. You should start off with actually participating in 4th generation fission nuclear plants. The plants you guys have now are mostly all 2nd generation, which are pretty crappy. 4th gen plants will use nuclear waste as fuel to make more energy, it is physically impossible for them to meltdown, because the reactor shuts itself down after it passes a certain temperature. 

For long term you should look at upgrading your hydroelectricity plants, Canada has a province that runs entirely on hydroelectricity. 

Another thing that looks extremely promising is Nuclear fusion reactors currently being researched, they use deuterium as a fuel, deuterium is produced from sea water. That means the reactor uses sea water as fuel, and they can't meltdown because to sustain nuclear fusion the temperature has to be extremely precise, and if it goes over and under that specific temperature the reaction cannot happen."

I think Clinton still won at the end of the day; she certainly does have a better temperament than Trump. But the media bias against Trump is the most extreme thing I've ever seen. The fact that he is level with Clinton despite not an ounce of positive media coverage for his campaign is incredible.  Some of Trump's policies are tough but make sense - especially the US role with NATO (without other countries paying ""their share"") and how US shouldn't be an ""international policeman."" But then some of his ""policies"" like building a wall are stupidity and he speaks a lot of rubbish, usually starting with the words  ""everybody says..."" With Trump you know that there will definitely be a CHANGE in the scene of American and World Politics - whether it's for better or worse (most likely worse) and with Clinton you have the same typical politician - no real change -  and things continuing to get progressively worse.

Ughbynfvqs6aj3gCoAEC,Insatiable Chaos,1503348679706,"I see problems with both candidates. Hillary seems to have a habit of hiding things and lying (though, I guess lying isn't new in politics). I think that Trump should release his tax returns and that Hillary should NOT have deleted those emails. While Hillary seems good in debate, Trump seems to struggle, particularly with temper and focus. Though just because Hillary is a better debater doesn't mean she'd be a better president by any means. I am worried with how diplomacy in particular would play out with Trump if he gets into office, not to mention his seemingly aggressive standpoint. Both Hillary and Trump seem to have made many mistakes during the past years. Though Hillary admitted that she had made a mistake with those emails, it still seems like more than a mistake to have done what she did (Trump had a good point there). Fact checkers seem to prove most of Trump's points wrong. A lot of his statistics are either inaccurate or outdated, which is potentially worrying. Though to be fair, Hillary has done her fair share of lying as well. Hillary seems dangerous, as does Trump, and both of which seem capable of damage. I also agree that Hillary is crooked, and that many 'behind the scenes' esq things are going on. Overall, both candidates don't seem like ideal presidential choices, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably choose Hillary. Don't get me wrong, Trump has a strong personality (And he gets some undeserved hate sometimes), and he seems smart and all, but I feel that Hillary is more grounded, calm, and has more realistic goals (Trump's idea of building a wall and deporting illegal immigrants is unrealistic, as he wouldn't have enough power as president, considering the senate and other areas are involved in decision making and can veto presidential choices).

He put the ridiculous chauvinistic, disrespectful racist , liar , pig of Trum on the ground! Yeay The stupid old guy just was able to stutter .. ah ah china  ah ah china they they they are doinfg this to us china china... in all his answers. He was so disrespectul unable to follow the simple rules of timing in the debate , he was childish , ignorant answers all the way . His stupid answers were only a verbal character assasination of the future President of the USA Hillary Clinton but he was not even able to answer the questions what a retard !  The more the ridiculuos Trump talked the deeper he sank hahahah . What a difference in class and emotional control Hillary has , I loved it when she said : and I am prepared to be the President ! That's very right go Hillary ! I am so satisfied to see that Trump Looked just the way he truly is :  A cynical , misguided racist supported by tons of white supremacist groups and endorsements for KKK and others  and people who are in character just like him a bunch of red necks who have never gone anywhere so they do not appreciate other cultures. . The fat ugly guy Trump  with no hair with all that money he says he has  that's all he thinks about. Doesn't he realize many people totally hate him? I mean seriously he says the most stupid things ever just like a person who never attended school or some weird syndrome that unables him to think staright before talking. Trump was unable to contain his toxic load of nastiness. His only ability is to be a BULLY a narcissist who thinks he is great even though his family should feel ashamed to be seen with that nasty racist chauvinistic A.H. The most funny moments were to see his fat ugly racist face red of anger when the next President Woman Hillary Clinton  asked him to show his tax returns and he kept giving excuses, but never answers ... ah  ah China ... china he said. hahah when she said he even own money has filed bankrupcy 6 times, hahah no even me I have once done that. He is a total A.H And even more he is so stupid he did not even think in apologizing to show some class after looking like a retarded bear  for the birth certificate issue. hahah And even more asqueroso he doesn't even pay the workers he had wprked for Him ? that's unacceptable even to God, and he called people names just like the bully he is .His favorite word in the debatewas : "" I"" I I I I never 'we"" instead Hillary said "" WE""The people. Trump the A.H He kept repeating stupid stuff over and over , he has just coin sounds in his decayed brain. His only response to everything was to blame another person : Hillary. who offer consistent responses, kept her class, did not let the retarded Trump distract her toomuch with his baffle. He can talk endless about nothing at all Great ! All retards vote for him , and people who actually want a true leader , with charisma, intelligence, and certain innocence and hope Vote for Hillary. She offered great plans to support the people you and me and our families our lives. Students, true significant issues with clear plans. She was higher in every way she did not resort to lower herself to pig Trump's level, he has some money but all that he has in money he lacks in true leadership, moral values, heart , compassion, goodness, he lacks transparency, he is racist , he is close minded, chauvinistic and simply lacks CLASS.  I am voting for Hillary all the way!!! And every time I pass by Trumps signs I honk - tatatatata-ta - ta ... it means CH. T .M. C . Right? For thos who get it ( No trump supporters obviously haha)Google it !  :D"

These two¬†American presidential candidates shouldn't be running for power, they are both sinister,¬†power-hungry and untrustworthy.¬† None is¬†morally better than the other.¬† The other, Hilary¬†Clinton, ¬†is just good at hiding her mischievous conduct.¬†¬† Donald Trump is a mumbling bumbling over-emotional simpleton who will find it hard to implement his political ideas if he ever get into power.¬† But I am still a fan of him because of his dislike¬†for the Muslims and I wholeheartedly hope he bans them¬†from entering America.¬†¬†America shouldn't become like Britain, we have some cities in Britain that look like the middle east, and¬†yes, we¬†have¬†many no-go¬†zone areas where you get confronted and threaten just for¬†¬†walking around holding your girlfriend hands or wearing western clothing's.¬†¬†When Michelle Obama visit a British school last time, she¬†was photographed with¬†a group of pupils all wearing red head scarves and¬†it was a nauseous sight¬†because that shouldn't be the face of British schools. ¬†¬†With regard to Trump, He's sees things as it's deliberately designed to appear to the public without actual critical analysis.¬† Basically he's an idiot who will find it hard to transpire his ideas into reality.¬† Many of the members of his own party doesn't like him and everything he stands for politically."

UgifW8iD1zgaKHgCoAEC,Lone Hansen,1503348782766,"Dear Americans, If you vote for Donald Trump, you will drag your country into a recession. This man is so full of himself, of greed, very disrespectful (interrupting all the time and then demanding everybody to listen to him!!!!) and know nothing about the rest of the World. He will sidetrack your country, since no country wants to negotiate with someone who do not have the slightest sincere bone, in his entire body, and lie whenever it suits him. In the entire debate, he did not come with anything substantiel as how to create new jobs. The result of the cutting tax will just result in even more greed for the 1% rich people, who already own 90% of the entire wealth. It will not get companies to start in the US. As long as there are cheaper places to set up ""shop"" this will be the place greedy people choose. And the World i governed by greed. Even Trump admits to be smart by not paying taxes. So the US have to compete on other merits than less tax. It has never worked before and it will not work now. Lower taxes have never gained any good merit or long term benefit anywhere in the World. Why do you think we Danes are the happiest people in the World? Because we do not mind paying taxes and being part of the development of our country. We can see how much it benefits our economy with a highly educated workforce. The public services make people feel secure so they can think about spending time with family and friends and not worry about getting sick, disabled, old or have to work two jobs to make ends meet. So it might be a good idea to invest in education as stated by Clitnon. The US have to remember that countries like India and China are creating highly educated engineers, in the millions, every year. And they are a lot cheaper than US counterparts and education is a lot cheaper. So the US have to do even better. This is not done by cutting taxes and having the expensive educational system as you have now. It pust the middle class and the poor at a disadvantage. You will end up with a lowly educated labourforce, which can not compete with the rest of the World of highly educated countries. I do not know why any Americans will accept this. It has now proven not to be the smartest system, when you can experience other countries are overtaking you in the fast lane."

Clinton has vision and the specific plans to make America the leading green-energy superpower of the 21st century. People need to check their REAL reason for their opposition to Clinton. Could it be the fact that she is a powerful ""woman"" and some may feel jealous and others may feel threatened.

Hillary cites Trump getting a loan from dad for18 million? he turned it into a 7 billion fortune which is incredible.Hillary has taken money from the highest bidder on hundreds of occasions as a 170k year public employee shes been paid 3 billion dollars. Watch Clinton Cash! Obamacare is garbage, ask anyone who went from 300 month health ins premiums to 1600 month. What a disaster. She deleted classified documents 30,000 plus that has put our great country in jjeoparty, and said she didnt know what the ""c"" in classified meant . Obama and Hillary are trying to start race riots, Take away our constitution one step at a time. Our roads and airports are 3rd world. 20 trillion in debt which has more than doubled since Oshead came in. And Obama and Hillary are rushing hundreds of thousands of unvetted young single men from Middle Eastern countries.in as fast as they can to start serious turmoil from within( Remember the trojan horse.)  When I was a child everyone was proud to be an American. Now people burn our flag, sit out the National Anthem. If you don;t love America Then Get the F out. America can be a great country again. Bottom line Mr Trump does not owe favors to wall street and big business like Hillary does... She owes so many people and countries that even if she actually cared about people instead of just money she would still be stuck having to do what she was paid to do. She is dangerous to our country and must be defeated if you care about the future of our once great country. UNemployment is at 22 % if you include underemployed people and the people who have given up on finding a job. Sorry for the run on sentences I have been working 15 hour shifts after they fired 2200 people at our company and made everyone left do 2 or 3 peoples work.

Trump has had 4 bk's and has had a 96% SUCCESS RATE WITH ALL HIS BUSINESSES, IF A BASEBALL PLAYER HAD THAT TYPE OF SUCCESS HE WOULD BE 100 X BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BALL PLAYER IN HISTORY!. He has hired 10/s of thousands of employees and Hillary has never created jobs. Watch Clinton Cash!!!!!!!!!  Watch out in a few days when control of the internet goes overseas the Media and the computers will all try too sucker us. Democrats are for big business and giving people just enough handouts to keep you down and out and keep Tyranny and slavery intact.

My score for this debate is 
Hillary 55% to Trump 45%. 

Why I am still saying Hillary lost?

In the debate, Trump had many disadvantages. Even with those disadvantages, he proved himself strong and presidential. 
Hillary was expected to win this easily because of her 26yrs of experience. And with the help of all these media and moderator, she hardly beat Trump. 

Disadvantages for Trump: 
1)Moderator was biased. 
2)Trump was asked more negative questions than Hillary. 
3)There was about 6 questions with fact-checked to Trump, and ""0"" for Hillary.
4)Hillary wasn't questioned again when she gave answers, but Trump was. 

I believe questions should be equally divided, because they didn't ask any of these questions to Hillary:
1) Benghazi
2) Her lies to FBI 
3) Clinton foundation corruption
4) TPP
5) NAFDA
6) Rigged election against Bernie 
7) Raped child: When she was lawyer she defended and freed that rapist. 
8) Four Americans (Diplomat) murdered in Benghazi. 
9) All her false Oaths; proven wrong by FBI. 
10) whether her health condition is perfect to be president of America. 
11) Her meanest comments for Trump supporters as ""Deplorables""

UgjXCNDlbMRsm3gCoAEC,J N,1503348832168,"A snippet of Trump's debate logic: 

Interviewer - ""Mr. Trump, what's 2 + 2?""

Trump - ""I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, ""What's 2+2""? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. What a disaster! Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.

First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, ""10101000101"", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. 

So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK?"""

Obama has been one of the worst presidents in history. Let me point out some facts for all you uneducated know-it-all people that THINK you know what's best for this country. Fact #1 When George Bush took office America's national debt was at 5 Trillion dollars. When he left office our nation debt was at 10 Trillion. When Obama took office our national debt was at 10 trillion and now today it sits at almost 20 Trillion dollars. On top of that we spend billions of dollars a year on food stamps and welfare for illegal immigrants in this country and send billions and trillions to other countries to support their country as a whole while we leave American's out in the cold and as our government makes broken promise after broken promise to we the people and you people eat it up like candy. Trump is NOT a politician. He is business man who took 1 million dollars and turned it into 10 BILLION dollars. And to do that you have to be economically smart. And don't say you could do that cause most people would blow a million with in a year. I'm not going to sit and argue with morons but i can't wait to vote for Donald J Trump November 8th and make America great again!!!!!!!!!"

I don't know if he said that or not, but if he did, that's true! Women don't deserve equal pay just because they are women. They deserve it for doing a good job. 

Men don't get equal pay either. Men get paid based on their abilities and work ethic. They don't get paid more because they are black, hispanic, or have a cleft lip. They are paid based on performance. If women expect to be paid equally to men, then they need to expect to work just as hard as men do.

As a man, I've often times not gotten paid equally to other men because I value my personal time, and I don't sell out to the company answering their beck and call at every moment of the day. And you know what? That's fine with me."

Kennedy said ""think not what this country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."" In other words, the people who surround you, your neighbors. This country's political ideology is the OPPOSITE of nationalism. It seems like the average American is ashamed to be an American, and again, that literally translates into being ashamed to be associated with our peers and our neighbors. America is one big, broken family. The average citizen is so self-centered. So ignorant. Democrats refuse to believe that their candidate can do wrong, and vice versa. You think Trump wants to pursue hate among us? In what world is Hillary not? Realize that ANYONE who focuses on class warfare, income inequality, racial issues, sex issues, etc. wants to divide, conquer, and steal. Hillary is a career politician, and I can't think of anything I'm really proud of that she's ever done and I'm no republican. She says that Trump may not be as rich as he says he is, or he's not charitable. Either way, we'd all LOVE to be in his shoes, whether or not he's not ""as rich"" as he says he is. Trump made it, he's a success, and so is Hillary. 

I wish Ron Paul was president because he's honest and CARES about people. These 2 clowns just care about bragging and bashing each other instead of being specific about ANY topic. Out of these two, I'd rather have Trump than Clinton. I'd vote Obama over Trump, Bush over Trump, or almost anybody over Trump. I'm ashamed of my vote, but good God, Hillary is horrible. Ultimately, values are the muscle of the country, and money is the spine. We can't be in this much debt, and that's Donald's strong point."

They keep going back and forth about debt and more jobs, more jobs, more jobs and more debt.  so the question really is, How is making more jobs going to actually make us more money... In reality, if you create more jobs for us to work at, then the value of our dollar goes down when you don't bring any money in from an outside source.  So the only way for this to actually work. Is for us to stop buying products from other country's and make our own products for the world to buy! The more we can offer the more the world will buy from us.  Now mind you trumps arguments are not exactly perfect but if you look at the bigger picture, closing out on products imported to the united states means less money going out.  Which is what he would like to see.  Which makes sense.  Now if we go with Hillary's argument, she makes complete sense but the problem is, by only increasing education status, creating more jobs, and creating more opportunities, only creates more chances for people to move their work to another country only to have American money once again leave the country.  Which means, it does not fix the problem... We need a change. While I personally do not agree with either candidate or really like them, I believe trumps argument when you pull it apart actually, makes sense. Finally the last part is, Hillary has a lot of secrets in her closet.  Do you really think she is going to tell you what those are? or that those will not come back to bite her, and by that, I mean, affect every American.

Trump's plan is about  lowering taxes on the Corporations ""the rich"" to induce higher flexibility for  company growth, and expansion  within the U.S. borders;  thereby creating new U.S. jobs with the intent of assisting the middle class to raise their standard of living. Policy ideals for both these candidates are on opposite ends of the spectrum:  Government control and regulation  versus  limited freedom for innovation, growth and opportunities.    We all live in a circle.   How do we want to live? 1) Being a cog in  the wheel  or 2) Retaining the freedom  self responsibility."
Ugj4KqQWQu1SbXgCoAEC,Dr. TJ,1503348943997,"Many of the post-debate commentators said Trump lost the debate with his responses to the release of his tax forms, stiffing people by declaring multiple business bankruptcies, and the birther/racism portions of the debate. While Trump did respond poorly in those portions, I think the responses of the two candidates to the cyber warfare, NATO, and ISIS portions are even more telling of just how little Trump understands international issues. Clinton's responses in the cyber warfare, NATO, and ISIS portions were thoughtful and direct. Trump saying (paraphrasing here) ""It may not have been Russia, it could have been other people that hacked the DNC servers"") just shows a willingness to make up stories that have no substance.

I was also a little surprised that Clinton did not jump on Trump's comment about opening up a club in Palm Beach, Florida that doesn't discriminate against people of color. Trump's comment about the Palm Beach club is similar to one where he tried to take credit for constructing buildings with handicap access. Trump is so desperate for praise that he tries to take credit for doing what should be done by everyone all the time (no discrimination) or following the law by constructing his buildings handicap access. This is like saying, ""Hey, I didn't rob a bank today, aren't I wonderful?"""

In my opinion, I think Donald Trump is the clear choice to be commander and chief and the leader of this nation.  Through his knowledge in fair negotiating, belief in strong military, law and order, and the will to fight for Americans first, I think he's the best choice in regards to him vs. Clinton.  Clinton's problem is she lies too much, WAY too much.  Through the lying, the e-mails, and getting 4 Americans killed in Bengazi then not caring for them or their families, I don't she is a good person nor will be a good president to run the United States."

UggN8HzkZhgDSHgCoAEC,Travis RC,1503348948602,"TRUMPCHOSIS
Trumpchosis is a mental disorder characterized by a voting choice that shows a complete disconnection from reality.

Trumpchosis is generally characterized as a disorder that compels one to believe, and vote for Donald Trump no matter how incompetent he appears to otherwise mentally  healthy individuals. Victims of this disorder also suffer from delusions that, if elected, Donald Trump can do any of the things he has promised in his campaign. 
SYMPTOMS OF TRUMPCHOSIS

‚Ä¢ They suffer delusions of overwhelming victory. 
‚Ä¢ They feel that Trumps ignorance to actual world politics/affairs is a ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù characteristic for the President of the United States.
‚Ä¢ They believe that facts that contradict Trump are just liberal media spin that‚Äôs paid for by the Clinton cartel!
‚Ä¢ They will proudly declare that ‚ÄúI am not racist!‚Äù, yet they are not quite comfortable with how BROWN America has become, which is why they feel the need to ‚ÄúTAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY!!!‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ They will have yelled, or angrily typed any of the following in the last year:  Crooked Hillary, Benghazi, emails, pay for play, unfair, liberal, lock her up,  build a wall, or lying Hillary.
‚Ä¢ Listening to Hillary Clinton speak for more than a few minutes invokes a fit of inexplicable rage, and/or nausea.
‚Ä¢ When Donald Trump is asked about his future plans as president, and he answers by talking Obama, their reaction is: ‚ÄúNAILED IT!‚Äù (High five‚Äôs the guy next to them).
‚Ä¢ They can‚Äôt listen to actual policy speeches so their candidate treats his policy speeches like pep rallies. Lots of yelling and cheering. No, long boring words, just short, catchy slogans that are easier for their afflicted minds to remember. Even ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù was too long, had to be reduced to #MAGA. ‚ÄúI love the poorly educated‚Äù -Trump 2015
‚Ä¢ They allow Donald Trump to lie with impunity while simultaneously raging against Hillary Clinton for made up lies they think she may be telling. Trumpchosis causes severe logic deficiency.
‚Ä¢ The easiest way to spot Trumpchosis is to CHECK THE EYES. As victims try to defend Trump‚Äôs erratic, flip-flopping, inconsistent, incoherent campaign the WHITES OF THEIR EYES become exposed.  A clear sign and obvious sign of Trumpchosis."

UgjGLzEHLAeT23gCoAEC,pretty bullet,1503348959418,It's very obvious from watching this debate that Hillary Clinton has the political know how to help run the country.  I'm not saying that she is perfect or even completely honest because she's not.  [ And neither is he ]  but then very few politicians are..  I figure that's one of the reasons why a lot of the GOP dreaded the fact that Trump ended up as their candidate. Donald Trump [ who has zilch political experience ] is going up against Clinton [ who has many decades of experience in how a government actually runs.]   I can imagine that the high level GOP's are cringing about these debates.  I don't think that Trump realizes just how little power he will actually have. Being the president of your own company is totally different than being  President of the U.S.A   I remember hearing him say one time that even though he lacked political experience that he didn't see it as a problem. He stated  that his advisors will give him the facts and then he will  make the decisions from there.  I'm not really sure that he even realizes what the House and Senate are there for.  During an interview with President Obama I remember him making the comment that he didn't realize just how little power he really had as the President.   If by chance Trump does become President I believe it will be quite an eye opener when he see's that it's more than  just him  giving the orders and the orders being carried out.  He's going to have to work with Congress and that is going to end up being a total disaster.

Clinton is a sociopath - she has been a part of the government that has turned the DOJ and FBI into political arms of the White House.  THAT - of all things - as much as her taking money from anyone who has it regardless of ties to foreign governments or terrorists AND her complete lack of regard for security - is most troublesome.  She appears to be completely disconnected from the American public (and a little weird).

Trump is a media/glory hog.  He is in so over his head that what happened Monday was embarrassing to watch and listen to.  He is an opportunist who repeats phrases that incite reactions thus giving him glory (in his mind).  Bigger than that - because he will lose - is the Republican party. They are a sham and should be ashamed of themselves.

I am not convinced that she is trust worthy or would do right by middle class and the poor.

CNN contacted me yesterday asked me to do a full analysis on the debate (and I obliged, free of charge...the things I do for Democracy, pls note the views expressed are mine & mine alone). 

I won‚Äôt tell you who won the debate, you can judge for yourself. However‚Ä¶.I do have some general observations, advice & recommendations for drumpf (and any other future idiot who wants to run).

In random order

drumpf‚Ä¶in typical drumpf fashion‚Ä¶praised himself‚Ä¶(says that he was too nice and didn‚Äôt want to embarrass Hillary), this was after he blamed Lester Holt for being bias and also blaming a faulty microphone. 


drumpf‚Ä¶you need to take responsibility for your own actions, man. Why don‚Äôt you just come clean and admit that you didn‚Äôt prepare and had no clue what you‚Äôre on about. 

drumpf‚Ä¶you got whipped by a woman‚Ä¶what‚Äôs worse‚Ä¶*she‚Äôs not even a 10*. 

drumpf‚Ä¶reality is different from ‚Äúreality TV‚Äù‚Ä¶get the point???

drumpf‚Ä¶bringing up Sean Lumpy Hannity is not a viable defense

drumpf‚Ä¶I saw you sniffling‚Ä¶I hope Hillary didn‚Äôt give you Pneumonia, next time bring some tissues

drumpf‚Ä¶I saw you drank (a lot) of water‚Ä¶Hillary didn‚Äôt even take 1 sip‚Ä¶don‚Äôt lecture us on stamina, ok. 

drumpf‚Ä¶a debate between 2 people is very different from a debate where there‚Äôs 15 other guys acting as sandbags for you...

drumpf‚Ä¶seriously dude‚Ä¶your business record sucks‚Ä¶it speaks for itself‚Ä¶I mean, how many other Billionaire(s) have filed for multiple Bankruptcies and have that many Lawsuits filed against them???

drumpf‚Ä¶who called yourself ‚ÄúMaster of Media‚Äù and yet you claimed that mainstream Media is biased against you (WTF???)

drumpf‚Ä¶you‚Äôre a national disgrace and an international embarrassment‚Ä¶don‚Äôt believe me‚Ä¶just f*ckin‚Äô Google it

drumpf‚Ä¶they say never carry a knife to a gun fight‚Ä¶you carried neither the other night‚Ä¶the only thing you carried into there was your mouth‚Ä¶and it did nothin‚Äô for ya

drumpf‚Ä¶after the debate, I saw you went into the ‚Äúspin room‚Äù I thought that was a bit desperate‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never seen anyone ever done that before. Did you even shake Lester's hand??? 

drumpf‚Ä¶your comments about Alicia Machado was disgraceful‚Ä¶and you know it‚Ä¶*there‚Äôs only 1 truly Disgusting Slob in America drumpf‚Ä¶and it ain‚Äôt her. 

drumpf‚Ä¶Hillary Clinton belongs in the Whitehouse‚Ä¶ you however, belong on the Springer Show 

Finally drumpf‚Ä¶*it‚Äôs not your fault you have small hands*‚Ä¶Yeah I know, I know‚Ä¶(people can we please drop this thing about the size of drumpf‚Äôs hands‚Ä¶no matter how small it may be)."

All Hillary is, is talk and talk and talk. On the other side, Trump has the energetic honesty. A kind of a serious inner power to conduct the nation properly - just watch any of his rallies. After doing so you won't say he hasn't got it. I think he's doing a lot better with his conscientiousness. He also looks a little bit like a turtle (just a joke, of course), and that's a good sign of vitality (lifespan of a bigger turtle is an average of 100 years, without having severe health problems if you know what I mean ;D). When it comes to ruling the world, it's all about the verve. I don't trust him yet, but surely he could be surrounded with better people than she was and is right now. I would rather vote on him, because he thinks and acts bigly. And Hillary? She's not a doer, she's a plain talker. She does zilch, while extremely hoping for her (not her, actually) calculated and inflexible plans' to work. And when they would fail, the same way as they failed in the past (mainly caused by the embezzlers, of course), she would completely slow down our economy - yet again and again. Year after year, it would systematically get worse and worse (40 or 50 or 60 or 70 year olds can see that now). Don't you smell the opportunity for sheer embezzlement here? Trump's verve is an assurance and at the same time an insurance of doing things fast-paced/flexibly. Also of being surrounded with more competent people instead of all-the-way-up wannabe politicians. You must remember one thing - being slow as a ruler gives a huge field of operation/a playground to embezzlers - especially for insiders (whom we know Clintons' foundation protects as if it was a matter of the utmost necessity). Remember that in future! Trump's policy is going to loosen the pressure on a middle class businesses/workers by rendering all the regulations to easier. After he won, he would have no time to actually safezone the people who worked for the government. I think that's the main change here. In the government. He would naturally act like a vacuum cleaner. It's not about him! It wouldn't be he himself who would change things to better, but the whole nation would! Us! You, your parents, your sister, your brother, your aunt, your uncle or your cousins! Or even your friends. Do you see that or are you that blind? Hillary, as one of the main decision makers in the USA for the past 30 years, simply sped this nation's problems up. She's surprisingly bad at what she's been doing. For years!!! She's good! Especially at talking. ;) I don't freakin' trust her any more. Why would you? Ask yourself.
What's more...
Now she's like ""we need"", ""we need"", ""we need""! Just listen to her. In my honest opinion, it's outrageous! It's a disgrace when a huge politician says what a minor one would: ""we need"", ""we need"", ""we need"". It speaks for itself. Yes, we freakin' need - as a nation we know all that already! On the other hand Trump says what's to be done. What he implies, are not stories, as Hillary's shills think and say - his statements are simply the act of preparation. He is already preparing for the changes he wants to apply, the same way as Hillary's speech was prepared for the debate (by the way, it was perfectly staged - she acted as the highest craft of the most manipulative politician - congratulations to her preceptor, seriously). She even uses her own foundation's fabricated arguments to make us certain that she's in control... She acted like she perfectly knew what her old establishment is doing - that's another lie. The very moments she didn't speak were the moments where you could see how calculative she was towards Trump, instead of being honest towards us. She didn't know how to repair this country for 30 freakin' years, damn it! It's an insult to human intelligence. Don't do it next time, just please. Stop doing that!

You should really drop a hint at Trump's honesty in almost all of matters they debated about. That's what makes him more reliable as a president. Someone could finally speak for us, for the people. Look at Obama - he acts like he changed anything - a lot! His one-sided and completely dull speeches always made me curious about why he acts like this. Now I know that his heart was and will always be indifferent. He always reads those prearranged texts like a salesman, while staging his own emotions to make some people fall into them - but not all of us are that naive. Every time he neglected the real problems on the national level. How Hillary acted in the debate was just another example of how extremely prearranged she could get, even more than Obama. Instead of trying to let people know how strongly she could be trusted, she played her robotic role as perfect as she could. She acted and still acts like she was presumptuously legit! That is a total and complete insult towards the community! The very fact that she acts like she was even slightly reliable is simply overwhelming to a healthy conscience! And because of that same exact fact I despise her. Few days ago she made fun of Trump by saying ""He's gonna' wear his read tie, I'm sure"", while laughing at him, then suddenly she shows up wearing that eye-hurting crimson suit. Guys, I'm never voting on her! Not because of her lack of reliability, but because of her sheer lack of self-criticism! Trump's got the healthy conscience, that's why he doesn't want to play her psuedo-moral games anymore - he just wants to move forward with everything - don't you feel the energy that he emanates with? This debate made me sure of one thing - what Hillary does best, is slowing other people down, instead of healthily speeding the system and her own self up. Throw a rock at me if you think otherwise. That's exactly why this debate made me feel proud of that guy Donald. The temper has nothing to do with the lack of self-criticism. Make a note on that. A full vote on Trump here, guys."

And all this in the General ""piggy Bank"" acts of America there in heaven! Hillary Clinton, has already ""spent material"" and as Secretary of state his policy in the world proved once again that the United States is the cancer of the planet! It is in the physical (visible) world. And the language of metaphysics (invisible to the human eye) said that the United States is a 300-year-old metaphysical(!) satanic project that has evolved over 300 years, the human rabble, went across the ocean from all over the world of the ephemeral ""American dream"" (better to say they ""walked"" through the lust of the eyes, not the heart) the whole human husk criminals, prostitutes, lovers of ""warm baths"" and so on, which are ready for ""shiny beads"" to sell not only the memory of ancestors, mother, but even the soul! Even the statue of liberty (created in the image of the goddess of darkness Hecate), and the satanic icons (Masson - sensitive Satanists) on the dollar, their metaphysics points about this project on planet Earth and who really wants to replace the true value (invested by God in the beginning) around, with the help of globalization and world government for ""exceptional"" nation to make its own criteria of values, where ""God"" is a question of money and permissiveness. Criteria promote its goals of America in the world America is promoting through the lies (Colin Powell with the vial at the UN -the result of millions dead and Iraq is wiped off the face of the earth), hypocrisy - a change of rulers under the pretext of democracy), through the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people (example - the last meeting of the UN Security Council on Syria, show in the style of Hollywood performed by Samantha Power, which is not enough to show a bloody baby toys, and so to deceive millions of Americans!)..............and flowing rivers of human blood in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine..., millions of broken lives, in the past, economically developed and prosperous countries in the end driven into the stone age. The Lord is merciful, but there is a limit, especially when the infection eats the whole body.

 The answer to all of today's problems are told by the writings of our founding fathers.
 We the people must take the power back by boycotting every corporation around us.
Sacrifice convenience and price for liberty and freedom. If we open the borders to those who don't care and will not stand up against our oppressors, then we will really be screwed. It's bad enough I see ppl in camo shopping at Wal-Mart and eating facist CAMO food while driving their hummer with my tax $.

Climate change is worst than destroying America and what it STOOD for, and is not something we can put off.
 I say these words as a man who does not drive, does not support ANY of these corporations, does not support CAFOs. I know the quotes of our founders, and I know why we went to war with Britain in the first place. This entire system is completely against our founding, and we are REQUIRED to boycott it all.
""The end of democracy and the defeat of the American revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of lending institutions and moneyed incorporation""-Thomas Jefferson-1816
""Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it""-Thomas Paine
""If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude than the animated contest of freedom, go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms.

Ugh7sqIaCbftTXgCoAEC,Vincent Pergrossi,1503349071276,"Nobody even mentions Gary Johnson or Jill Stein within this debate. I love how the government censors people that they don't approve of. Many people believe that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton are fit to be president or that they will lead America or the rest of the world to prosperity. In spite of this, the media effectively mutes the ideas and limits the renown of other potential candidates. This prevents a large portion of the United State's citizens from even considering the possibility of a third-party candidate, such as Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. For those of you that feel like there is no winning with this year's presidential election and are not aware of the two possibilities that I listed, please research them. You may find the alternate candidate that you may choose to support. Should you decide that neither of those two are the right option for you either, then you are entitled to your own respective opinions, and I respect you for taking some of your time to become more involved than you may have been beforehand. Censorship is wrong, and the debates are part of the issue. By excluding the third-party candidates from expressing their ideas in front of the millions of people that watched this debate, the curators are practically preventing them from potentially building up their campaign. I do realize and understand that a candidate requires a polling threshold of at least 15% to take part in the debates, but it is the media to blame for the lack of their prevalence within the presidential race. The news channels only ever talk about or report on Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, which prevents the third-party candidates from becoming well-known, as well. Overall, this means that they are not given an equal chance to win over the people of the United States, and the third-party candidates are not given an equal chance to spread ideas, which is censorship to the ideas that big businesses and the dominate social class of the extremely wealthy disapprove of. Protect and enforce out first amendment. Our country's founders added the Bill of Rights to protect the standard citizen and their beliefs. I don't see why this is not true in this modern day. Protests end in violence from officials that attacked without provocation, but that is a topic for another comment. Thank you for reading.

P.S. Regardless of the attempts of the officials and CEOs that try to keep these two under wraps, Gary Johnson is not far behind from becoming a part of the debates anyway. He is currently polling around 7%, which is very nearly half of what is required. He is not giving up and his numbers grow by the day. Do not feel like your vote would be worthless if you voted for a candidate that you do not believe will win the race. Every vote counts. If everyone felt like that, then nobody would ever win. Consider your options carefully and consider who and what you stand for based on your own needs and beliefs, not mine nor anyone''s."
Ugg2ZjbjddsZE3gCoAEC,Jean Thomas,1503349071286,"Trump says he will bring business back to America and help keep it here in the US. How? He says through tax breaks and deregulation. Then he goes on to tell Americans that he was ""smart"" not to pay taxes. So if this is his business common sense then we would have large corporation flocking into America unregulated and paying nothing in taxes. Hello America this equals slave wages, dangerous working conditions, and inferior and possibly hazardous products flooding the US market. 

I cant believe he even has supporters. People he is wealthy from cheating admitted tax evasion and purely driven by self greed. What he basically thinks is that his stated income of over 600 million was not enough income to contribute and help  pay for roads and law enforcement and all the securities  that are funded by taxes. Yet he agree he wants to  increase theses services to better American People. So its ok that we pay the bill and he gets a free ride on his 600 million income. 

Trump talks the talk on immigration constantly speaking about boarder control and illegal immigrants in America costing the American people money and jobs. Yet the illegal immigrants at least pay taxes and help shoulder the burden. While Trump believes hes ""smart"" for avoiding his civic responsibilities. 

That alone makes Trumps supporters either severely uneducated, super rich, or a stock holder of a large corporation.

Course I see things that others don't.¬†Like both¬†candidates don't give a damn about The Children, let alone anyone outside their elitist circle. The only thing I can think, when looking at these two candidates, and thinking of¬†children,¬†is, WHERE THE HELL IS JESUS ???¬† I¬†know. Right? Ok,¬†any REAL¬†Hero on a white horse, at a scary time like this. However, he had a thing about protecting children. And they have never been in more danger. Nuclear destruction.¬† Thing is, and¬†allegedly it's supposed to be a big secret, ¬†I hear that the Pope, Mormon Prophet, Protestant Queen of England, the President, CIA, FBI, Secret Service,¬†on down to the police, post office, trash collector, salesclerk, Hollywood, Sports, all know where Jesus is. If you're government and don't know, you need to get to the water cooler more often. Get some of Hillary's lost emails. the one that leaked out was about ""that Jesus things."" They don't do their own spellcheck apparently. And, the question is, ""What Jesus things?""¬†¬† I think anyone that has a child and wants that child to have the opportunity to grow up and have children of their own and so on,¬†would want them to have¬†a planet to live on. Like this one. In fact, this one. Since it's the only one we have to live on.¬†if either one of these two candidates become president, you can kiss your baby right now and every day, and all those grandchildren that may never even get to be born, or if they do, are covered in radiation poisoning. ¬†This planet doesn't have much longer before there is no atmosphere to protect us from the Sun. These two candidates don't give¬†a damn about that. They already know they're dead anyway. Why should they care about anyone else surviving. They'll shoot the nuclear missiles. Trump already admitted he could. So either way, planet is doomed. ¬†¬† Colin Kaepernick and his Knights in Shining Armor, protesting during the anthem, gently, and reverently with a Kneel, I do believe was asking America, the president even,¬†for change in how people were treated. The president is stepping down.¬†I believe if Jesus were President, there would be no more protests for equality and protection¬†for All in America. And if we have a racial civil war brewing in Satan's cauldron, we're going to need Him again. He's good with America coming out smelling like a Rose after the Wars. And who knows how many wars and disasters¬†he and his Angel friends have nipped in the bud. We don't know, because they didn't happen. I heard Gabriel, aka Mother Mary gave her Soul to Satan in '62 in exchange for ending the Cuban Missile Crisis -¬†WITHOUT nuclear war. Since, it happened. So a God, some think of him as Superman, Captain America, etc. and his wife Gabriel aka Mary, went back in time and made a deal with Satan. Her Soul, no war. Satan already had Jesus trapped in an abused child, so his mother jumped in with him. Satan still has them. Their only escape, is to get elected president. Trump called for harder torture on ""Terrorists"" which is what they called Jesus, for writing a book on Revelation. ¬†¬† The bonus perks are: world is saved for all future generations, thus creating many new jobs. The Oppressed's Faith in a Hero finally pays off and they can start to enjoy life too. Colin can stand up during anthems. America becomes an Honorable Nation instead of the¬†Planet's Main¬†Destroyer.¬†Bill Clinton¬†called Jesus a Terrorist too, which should take the wind out of the Terrorist's sails. And Jesus would go down fighting,¬†until all Evil is eliminated. So that People can wake up every day, glad to be alive. Instead of as they do now. Living in fear of what new hell the day may bring. Drudging through the day, half dead, or all dead. I imagine if Jesus were president, you'd see change. Every week, I imagine, something new and better happening. Life and the health of the world getting better and better every day. People waking up from a long sleep."

Look people it's an¬†easy decision to make, all You need to do is ask Yourself if You are insane because the definition of insanity is repeating the same proses over and over and expecting a different outcome,¬†""So are¬†You going to¬†vote"", Sorry¬†I meant to say- ""are You going insane"", And if you haven't got an answer to either¬†then maybe¬†You should get You're advice from a bunch of children, because every debate I've seen in this nonsense race with expectance to maybe this last¬†one¬†'excluding the moderator', have had¬†the appearance of a bunch of¬†adult's acting like children.¬†¬†¬†¬†The Government are meant to govern, not partake in a popularity contest. So I have Our almighty God¬†as My Ruler and he has never let¬†Me down not, even once, and His term is everlasting like His Love.

George Soros is reported to have paid people to protest, and even in NC recently, most of the ones doing criminal acts, looting, fighting etc., were BUSSED IN from other states!  I don't believe it's any coincidence that BLM people were disrupting Trump's rallies. 

  This is engineered social problems probably to try to distract people from what is going on politically, to create a sense of unrest, and feelings of insecurity among the people in order to get them to swallow bad laws/politics for the sake of ""peace and safety"" as the globalists push their agenda more and more via crisis whether engineered or simply taken advantage of.

At all Americans (sorry for the word) are idiots to not see that are being manipulated. I know everyone of you are very patriotics, the bad of that is you have a giant ego. And the problem with the ego, It makes you act by feelings and not by reason.

Why do not you think better? Simple logic. Why would someone who had never worried about his country suddenly bacomes the voice of the people?
Its simple proposals are rubbish, have a very poor idea about politics.

Worst of all is its dangerous terrorism. Which has killed millions of people ... oh wait that's never happened. In history are at least 4000-5000 people killed by terrorist attacks. How many people know the simple fact of not having money or life insurance there dead? 5000000.

Because if I recall correctly, didn't Obama give a bunch of money to a ""Solar power"" company (or a group wanting to build solar panels) and the company went bust?   

And the last Economic Crisis had more to do with banks not loaning to the right people.. giving loans to people who should never have had them, selling homes to people who couldn't really afford them,.. and it all collapsed because once those balloon payments came due, no one could pay them.  No money going to the banks and it all came crashing down.  That had nothing to do with reducing the taxes of the rich.  I think Trump has a good plan.. taxing those businesses that are going overseas when they want to sell their products back 'home' (the home they abandoned, to the people they fired) is a great idea!

And Hillary is the one that was boasting about how she was going to put millions of coal mine workers OUT OF WORK!!  WTH is she thinking!?

Not understanding a basic thing like which documents are classified and which are not.. not ""getting"" that she was not to use a private email server, or to send classified documents on a personal email (including on her personal phone) etc. just speaks volumes about how unqualified she really is.

Caucasians...possibly by extension, one religion. 4. Social Mobility will disappear. The rich will get richer and the poor will be buried. Middle class and white collar will become obsolete, because anyone not on the multi-million dollar corporate train or above, or private big hitters or old money, will be reduced to third class menial workers that get standard, fixed wages.

Trump is right...she has essentially been in office for 30 years and things are still a mess, yet SHE is going to be the one to fix it in 2016? Meanwhile this country is nearing 20 TRILLION dollars in debt thanks to the last two decades of Obama, Bush and Clinton. If she has all these plans and ideas to heal the country, why doesn't she implement them NOW?

Go back and watch the Obama/Hillary debates from 2008, Obama said the same things Trump is saying now. Hillary will SAY ANYTHING to get elected because that's all she does...run for office. She wants to run on her husband's record of success, but when confronted with his blunders (both private and political), she averts the topic and claims she shouldn't be tried on her husband's record. She want's it both ways. She feels she is ENTITLED to be President, and we should all get in line and bow to ""her Majesty"". 

Trump is not a perfect man by any means, but I give him major props for walking away from his business to run this campaign. He could retire and spend the rest of his life doing anything he wants, but he is out there slugging it out on the campaign trail working for the opportunity to be President. He is not polished and speaks his mind, which sometimes bites him in the ass, but I would rather have that then an android who spouts the same talking points, offers the same ""go nowhere"" solutions that never happen and only care about ""the little people"" when it's time for you to vote again.

The lighting was also better on Clinton and dimmer on Trump (great reference to the Kennedy/Nixon debate!). I won't go into Mr. Holt's admonishing of clapping for Trump but absolutely silent when supporters clapped for Clinton. 

I do not support the neo-facists ideas of Trump but he did strike me as saying something  true when he said our country is hurting. 

But thanks to Wasserman-Schultz,  Schumer, Murray, Reed, Pelosi, Obama, and all the other too long in office, sold-out, bought Democratic party hacks, they rigged the primary so that the biggest purveyor of Crony Capitalism and a liar to boot was selected as the Democratic nominee. Hillary is not going to make nobody's lives better when she and Bill gets shoe-horned in to the Oval Office so they can start selling off what is left of this great nation, its ideals and principals to the highest better. Oh, and Hillary and Bill are on the record racists too.

I am an African-American woman, professional, 54 and middle class. I hate these two candidates with all my being but if someone held a gun to my head and said vote or you will die, I would pull the lever for Trump. Again, he said last night that there is something very wrong in this country and he is absolutely correct."

Ugh71bE3z_TUr3gCoAEC,yourdarklordandsaviour,1503349192553,"(British) I see people criticising Trump, calling him a racist and call bullshit on that. He wants to do the best for his country and is representing his people accurately. I hope he does build a wall - nobody wants illegal immigrants, (potential) terrorists and a flood of refugees entering their country. 

He should have added, on the topic of racism - because it is clear that this is aimed at the 'Black Lives Matter' campaigns, and police shootings of black males - 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks, blacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do, and the percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is due not to a sudden epidemic of racism, since black on black crime has been at it's lowest in the 1940s/50s when racism was rampant and legal. It is a result of culture, a result of diminished family values, over 72% being born out of wedlock (2013 study), and over 79% being raised by single mothers (2003, Cook County).

Regarding the rest of the debate. While it was clear that Trump struggled to answer certain questions, seemed somewhat unprepared, and deflected. Hillary did the same thing but amplified and in a more underhanded, sly manner: she deflected, avoided questions, prepared non-answers which she was reading, laughing and and smirking at Trump and the audience. In addition, she's trying too hard to please everyone and appeal to minorities and women, promising more freebies more privileges, free money, free university education. Nothing is ever free. Who does she expect to pay for all of this? The money owned by the rich won't cover it. I doubt the people who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to her campaign would happily give their hard earned money away. 

In fact, Hillary and her campaign funders probably have ulterior motives and are using her as a female to get more votes. The fact that she has a vagina does not mean she'll make a good President. She has a long track history involvement in corruption and shady deals. Even what's going on with the media - they only negatively portray Trump, and do the opposite for Clinton. Google deliberately shows positive results when people search for Hillary Clinton - wonder how much they got paid. Trump gained a massive support on his own, while Hillary is using dirty politician's tricks, bribery and throwing dirt on Trump's campaign to elevate herself in the polls and gain more votes. 

More atrocities committed by Clinton(s) are mentioned in the other comments on this debate, please read. Although, a quick google search of Clinton's corruption, pending investigations, ties to a KKK recruiter, failed deals, and potentially disastrous proposals for the US are all available on the web.

Neither of these people are Presidential material, but Trump is definitely the lesser of two evils and may actually do some good to restore faith in the system. Something about Hillary's cheating, lying mug, on the other hand, deeply infuriates me. VOTE TRUMP 4 PREZ #makeAmericagreatagain"

BUT
I'm not buying it. It seems like she is a marionette without own mind. She says what a lot of presidents said before and it just seems so scripted..
Trump answers out of his own mind and heart that's why he stumbles sometimes.. he didn't scripted his answers and they just seem so natural.
He is shocking. Different. That's why he attracts a lot of people. Because he sometimes says the ugly truth.

I have to say i do not like any of these two.
But maybe if you want change vote for someone different.

Hillary is a liar who deleted emails which probably contain sensible information.

Trump maybe is not as rich as he says he is and maybe he is not paying taxes.

WHY out of 300 million Americans these two are standing there?
It scares me
So much Americans and the two finalist are two people which it seems like nobody can really stand. Two loud mouths.
Not a single one who can attract ALL the pople

THIS is the problem in many communities, but esp in black communities where fathers abandon their children and leave young men to grow up in single mother homes with low income, who themselves turn to violence and crime to get by. And the cycle goes on and on and on. You have a choice, people of every shade. YOU can choose to work, not acquire debt, live within your means. Sometimes that means being very, very poor.

also, immigration IS GOOD. people think its just that theyre stealing our jobs and putting a strain on the government.  no. in realting what immigration does is it massively boosts our economy, our economy wouldnt survive without migrants. we have an ageing population with more elderly dependants and there is a defecit of workers in the economicslly active group to be able to pay for them. so migrants help fill this defecit which wouldnt be filled any other way. they also do the jobs we dont want like night shifts, cleaners etc. that would leave a massive skills gap in our economy too if they werent there. it is essential for every ageing population to have migrants. thats why australia want far more in.

-Sometimes I feel like America needs to be run like a company for a few years
-Why does Hillary just keep plugging her different books and websites? Shut up...
-No ones listening to the moderator...
-Slap fights galore
-Trump, please stop using small adjectives... It doesn't look good
-Hillary please stop addressing the crowd for approval, it looks weak
-I agree the trickle down doesn't work very well. To make anything strong you start from the bottom up... I know nothing of economics however
- We didn't need to be told that Obama was playing golf after you told us he was going to the golf course when he retires... Unless he just like to hang out there... What was the question?
-OH! Get'em Lester
-Bait and switch, Hillary? You're also dodging the email question...
-""There's something he's hiding"", Hillary... Pot meet kettle
-I like the word ""braggadocious"" 
-I also think we should be fixing things inside the country before fixing the world. Within reason
-Talking about how many people love you feels a lil sad, Trump. Don't fall into her traps
-Hillary will only stoke the fires of these ""race wars"" by feeding Black people the garbage that they're constantly victims. Trump would probably also put gas on it by too bluntly telling them they're acting like babies... They are, but still...
-The leading cause of African-American male deaths is African-Americans males...
-Racial profiling, depending on how and where it's used, is a good thing
- Hillary, building strawmen like she's the wizard of Oz
-I like what Hillary said about implicit bias. I don't wanna, but I do
-Hillary bringin' out the R-word for all the regressive left hordes...
-Haha, Trump callin' out HIllary on her two faces. Good
-Trump told Putin to hack you, not Americans, Hillary. Stop it
-Hillary licking her lips in rage and/or worry... Very brief, but it tells a lot
-Trump supporting the war doesn't really make any sense. When you boil anything down with Trump it's about business. He doesn't see any profit in war. Hillary however...
-Trump, please calm down. Proving you have a better temperament isn't going well. You go off on tangents to save face and end up losing more of it. Stop being batted
-1:50:11 Hillary is looking pretty haggard. She'll sleep good after this...
-Hillary, I agree saying you have a secret plan sounds like, ""I have a girlfriend in another state..."", however he shouldn't be broadcasting HOW he's going to defeat someone is a stupid thing to do
-hahaha,  Crowd: ""You won't tell us when to clap!!""
-God, Hillary. He didn't say those things about women. He said those things to one WOMAN at a time. Not ALL WOMEN
    Thanks to anyone who's read this far... This was an interesting debate. Kind of annoying on both sides though"

UghexaCWXVYZUHgCoAEC,Dreighen,1503349274714,"Only watched up to the first debate question so far, but why not just have generous tax cuts for SMALL business owners - not the conglomerates, not wall street, but your mom and pop businesses, start-ups, etc. Those are the businesses that actively EMPLOY people. Why does this have to be complicated?

I believe we have to trade with other countries, like china to keep costs down in order to provide services and products within the budgets of middle America, so they aren't the villain in this per se. Americans need to take the initiative to BETTER THEMSELVES, rather than after work going home turning on the tv and tuning out. Take that time to get new skills , increase your marketability so that if you lose your blue collar job to china you have the skill sets to take on even better prospects.

The government cannot create jobs, that's the private sector's responsibility, in order for that to happen businesses need to be able to operate in an environment that's conducive to that growth, you can't grow while being heavily taxed as a small business and demand also play a role, you can't have a business if people cannot afford to spend money at your business. 

So it's simple - we need demand(consumer side) and we need business growth to meet that demand.

- Tax incentives to small business owners, new business owners, with a cap as you get into bigger businesses, the too big to fail businesses don't need tax incentives.
- Close big corp tax loops, a slight increase in the revenue they pay in taxes.
- Fix social security, medical, prescription costs
- Invest in preemptive measures to reduce the health costs related to obesity and other health issues in this country 
- Reduce some of the federal defense budget and have that money reallocated to Education (to reduce student loan debt)
- Tax cuts for poverty  and middle-class Americans so they have more discretionary funds to put back into the economy or save! (we tend to forget that concept here in this country) or use that money to invest in skills to help them rise in the socioeconomic ladder.
- Better trade deals with foreign countries that benefit middle American since those jobs are being shipped overseas to reduce costs. Surely with all the brain power in congress, and the private sector we can come up with a solution here other than reduced costs on the consumer end."

A raindrop may raise the sea but the only way the American people will survive the next four years is if we all work to elect someone who ACTUALLY has Americas best interests at heart; The part that terrifies me most about this is that as it stands now, I don't believe we have anyone on the ballot that has the welfare of the country over their own personal gain in their ""grand schemes"" and views of the future."

Hillary was predictable - smiles and sentences that don't mean anything. Typical marketing manipulation ""doesn't matter what you say, just keep smiling, be positive and pretend everything is fine"". I hope people won't fall for that.

HIllary at least sounds intelligent and clear headed.  She has had years of observation time from the inside of the political system.  Don't argue trade agreements and money and jobs with her.  Especially since you've only built one large corporation and gone bankrupt during those same years.
Donald is a pig and to be less politically correct than I should be, he is a retarded pig who makes the same grunting noises over and over again and has to be pushed and prodded to follow the same path to his money trough every day.
 sorry, he just sounds like a rambling drunk.  At least his lies are easy to read.  Glaringly easy.  Speaking of special interests, Trump should know all about corporate-political manipulations.  He might be savvy as Mr. President with that kind of skill, but it doesn't seem a good idea with his undisguised double talk and rambling.

After all it's because of people like her and her husband that we have the whole mess with NAFTA where all of our jobs can and are being shipped overseas. As bad as that is, my question has more to do with something that was proposed by Trump, and specifically that was also proposed and implemented by Bush and was a very big contributor to the 2008 great recession, by the way. If you haven't already guessed, it happens to be the tax breaks that Trump proposed tonight for the wealthiest Americans, which he himself claimed will (ALLEGEDLY) enable and/or encourage wealthy executives to create and keep jobs in this country as opposed to shipping them overseas. However, there is a giant loophole in this proposal, one which every republican since Clinton has apparently failed to acknowledge (keeping in mind that NAFTA didn't exist prior to Clinton, and so the outsourcing jobs thing would for the most part not have been an issue). At any rate, they are overlooking the fact that, as with Bush, the companies/wealthy executives/CEOs have had zero accountability to create jobs in this country in lieu of the tax breaks. Basically, it's as if they can take the tax breaks and then still continue to ship jobs overseas on top of it without any law or anything legal put in place to stop them. I know this to be the case because it was done under Bush, hence the reason why jobs were still being outsourced under Bush even AFTER he gave tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. What I am basically asking is will there be any accountability under Trump for companies to create and keep jobs in this country in exchange for the tax breaks. I did not once hear Trump talk about this during the debate, and it just scares me to death that we will have the same thing happen again like it did with Bush."

UgjDaJxj2wlNw3gCoAEC,Nico S,1503349324626,"I for my part am an Austrian citizen, and I think the outcome of this 
American presidential election is pretty important for all of us, not 
just for American citizens. I'm terrified about the fact that lots of 
people actually believe the things Trump keeps on saying. Yeah right, 
that doesn't mean Hillary is a saint either, but I wholeheartedly 
believe that Trump just isn't up to the burdens of US presidency. He 
knows lots about money, right, but that isn't the only skill required 
for a president, doesn't matter if its the president of Cameroon, 
Kazakhstan or the US.

All I am just saying is: please, Trump voters (and also Hillary voters!) try to get to the bottom of what the candidates are claiming, question all the things they claim being absolute facts! Dont just form your opinion on a red dress that suggest she's a devil or other stupid things like that.

And yes, if you ask me I would be pro-Hillary in this particular election, because I think she would lead to a more positive future than Trump. Populists like him exist also here in Austria, as well as in all other countries in the world and they are no good.
But that is just my opinion.

That being said, I for my part really like the US, despite the fact that unfortunately there are some people here in Austria that don't have a good opinion of the US."

WIth all the bombastic banter and NEWSPEAK from Hilary and others about supporting the downtrodden ""Middle Class"",  No one ever defines what they mean by those words. Is it someone making under $50,000 per year? Under 80,000 per year and over 30,000? OR can you make over $150,000 and still be included as one of this unfortunate group of losers? Define your terms!

Who are the ""Wealthy""? 
If you are making over $100,000 are you wealthy? I don't think so.
The middle class is losing because they are taxed into the ground on the money they earn. 
To me wealthy means making over $300,000 per year. Even then it doesn't mean you're that rich. The super wealthy hardly pay tax anyway as they have lawyers and tax accountants to make sure they don't. And they won't. 

Graduated income tax as outlined by KARL MARX in Das Kapital looks good on paper but is a disaster and has never worked in real economies. The only way to help the middle income earners is to drop personal income tax to a low flat rate and reform the Banking System so the government isn't paying taxpayers' money to interest on loans to FAT PIG bankers and other fat cats who never worked a day in their lives and wouldn't know a tax payment if it got up and kicked them right in the goonies."

From the fact that he was incorrect about his comments about 78% of the time. 
The fact that he somewhat admitted that he will not show his taxes because he has not paid them. 
The fact that he became flustered and lost his cool
The fact that he did not even try to go to the audience afterwards to shake hands with people who would vote for him
The fact that he had a chance to clear up top issues and he really did not. especially about race. that part was just awful.

However, Hillary Clinton while can speak beautiful speeches during the election, acts in opposite after the elections. She has proven record of not just weak diplomacy, but also her involvement in the corruption with the Clinton's Fund and being a war criminal for bombing the independent countries without the UN sanctions or invite from legit leader from those countries the US and its allies bombed in the past years. Her character is true demonic because the person, especially if you are the woman, can't be happy and laugh when the other leader dies. Remember her ""we came, we saw - he died, ha-ha-ha"" when speaking about brutal death of Muammar Qaddafi.  All she wants to do if elected is to support our corrupted military industrial complex conspiracy by creating more conflicts around the world, so her friends that make weapons could prosper at our tax-payers' expense. That is why she continues to demonize such leader as Vladimir Putin and Russia. Her claims about Russian hackers has absolutely no factual proof or support. Every intelligent PC user knows that it's impossible to pinpoint the hacker in this century. Donald has no diplomatic experience, but at least he defined the problems in the White House and hopefully his team will assist him in cleaning the House from rotten politicians."

Its in our nature to predict the worst. That is in fact what our brains do best, predict, so we can avoid getting hurt by dangerous outcomes and find some peace and joy in our lives. 

I suspect you'll find only loss and grief with Donald Trump. Trump is merely skillful at playing on people's negative emotions by reminding them over and over again what they often think themselves, that they are in constant danger. He just reminds you to feel that way over and over again. 

We do of course have some real challenges. Unfortunately Trump has neither the intellect or conscience to help protect any of us. He's actually one of the predators we're all afraid of running into, one of those whom we're all trying to avoid. He's shown little more than the classic hallmarks of an unprincipled con man. He uses stress to beat you down and lies about solving your personal problems to pump you up so he can elicit your support. He's simply using negativity and manipulative mind tricks to confuse you. He's as indifferent to the truth as he is to your circumstances.

It was stated that the last known look at Trumps tax returns showed he paid nothing in taxes. Nada, zip, zero. And he didn't deny it. In fact he seemed quite proud of that fact. His rebuttal? ""It's because I'm smart"". And then, right after that, he went on complaining about how our roads, bridges and other tax funded services in our country are that of a 3rd world nation. Seriously? So there you have it people. The man you want as president thinks it's smart to not do your part as a citizen and pay your taxes, and then bitch about how crappy our tax funded infrastructures and services are. Apparently that's how you make America great again. By being an entitled jerk. #DumpTrump"

Me and my fellow brethren are very offended by this false notion that we are somehow getting a free ride without paying a dime for the services offered. While it is true that our economy has flourished under the dependable protection from the US military in the past decades, it was more of a mutual agreement of interests; US also happened to be in the midst of cold war and in desperate need of a staging area to fight off communist expansion, and also a model country to tote as a token of supremacy of capitalism over communism (and certainly a fair share of genuine goodwill I am sure).

That being said, the cost of hosting USFK bases is nearly a trillion KRW annually, which is about a thousand million USD. Not exactly a chicken feed for a country with about a tenth of GNP US enjoys. Also, we are deeply concerned about the level of commitment the future American leadership will have in the event of a military crisis on our soil. Clinton had a clear cut answer to this, Trump was busy pointing fingers at people he shouldn't have. 

I have no idea how some of these most obvious factoids are lost on Trump' camp and his supporters. Maybe he prefers asking Sean Hanitty to some plain old googling? Not blaming the the poor moderator failing to address all these, he had hard enough job with the onslaught of so much misinformation and FUD coming from the great sniffer. Is Trump too lazy to do actual research, or given a free pass to go on purposely lying about so many things?

Before someone even attempts a slippery slope on me: there is no denying what Hilary did with her email thing was unethical and illegal. Again, I don't really like her personally and don't support her. At least she owned up to it unlike trump, when confronted about the birther fiasco and releasing his tax records.

How can you stand there and feel smug and proud about the fact you have paid NO tax. You are one of the mega-rich but have paid nothing in tax. That is disgusting. Pay tax and help your country create jobs.

She wants to increase the estate tax to 65%, so if you thought you'd be okay once you'd inherited the monies your parents worked hard and used their talents and skills to amass,think again!

No one has to file a 1040 unless they want to. There is nothing the IRS can do. You only have to 'pay' taxes IF you file a 1040 and sign your name on the dotted line. Otherwise, you are free and clear for life because the wage tax is voluntary. You also do not have to have taxes taken out of your paycheck. No wage tax goes to pay for anything in the United States as so many believe. The full wage tax is collected by the IRS, which is owned by the Federal Reserve, and it goes into the pockets of the bankers who own the Federal Reserve. We are simply slaves that work to pad their pockets. All you have to do is a study on IRS Fraud, and you can see this for yourself. Trump probably knows this but can't say it publicly. Note: this only applies to wage tax. (There are many YouTube videos on this subject as well as written transcripts - all put together by ex-IRS employees and other reputable sources.)"

To those, who don't read any long comments - read this, you won't regret it. You may even learn something new. Let's continue.

Hillary is all talk and talk and talk. Donald, on the other hand, has got an energetic honesty, the inner power to conduct the nation (don't say he hasn't got it, just stop lying to yourself, please). I think he's doing a lot better with his consciousness. He also looks a little bit like a turtle (just a joke, of course), and that's a good sign of vitality (lifespan of a bigger turtle is an average of 100 years, without having severe health problems if you know what I mean ;D). When it comes to ruling the world, it's all about the verve. I don't trust him, but he could surely be surrounded with better people than she currently is (actually she is surrounded by wrong people for many years now - you know that's a fact - nothing is changing to better - it's a freefall, a regression in the hands of globalists - is that really hard to understand?). I would rather vote on him, because he thinks bigly. 
She thinks almost zilchy, while extremely hoping for her (not her, actually) calculated and inflexible plans' to work. And when they would fail the same way as they did in the past (those failures were mainly caused by the American and British embezzlers, of course), she would completely slow down our economy yet again and again. Year after year it would systematically get worse and worse (as 40, 50, 60 or 70 year olds can see now). Don't you smell the opportunity for inside or outside economical embezzlement here? It always was the main factor in enrichment, especially for the bankers. Trump's verve is in my honest opinion an assurance and at the same time an insurance of doing things fast-paced and flexibly, also by being surrounded with completely competent people, instead of all-the-way-up wannabe politicians. You must remember one thing - being slow as a president gives a huge field of operation/a playground to embezzlers - especially for the insiders (whom we know Clintons' foundation protects - strangely, as if it was a matter of the utmost necessity) - remember that! Trump's point on American enocomy is to progressively change rules to less complicated and easier to live by. He would have no time for actually safezoning and hiding the people who worked for the government with bad intentions. Trump's win would change the nature of the very government and that's the main and most important point here! Not even he himself would change things to better, but the whole nation would! Us! Our fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts and cousins! Do you see that or are you blind? Hillary, as one of the main decision makers in the USA for 30 years, sped this nation's problems up for years now! She's surprisingly good at it. Especially at talking. ;) I don't freakin' trust her any more, sorry. Remember - that's only my opinion. No hate speech here.

Also - now she's like ""we need"", ""we need"", ""we need""! Just listen to her - it's outrageous! It's a shame when a huge politician says what a minor one would: ""we need"", ""we need"", ""we need"". It simply speaks for itself. Yes, we freakin' need - we know that already! :/ Trump says what is to be done and what he implies are not stories as Hillary's shills think - his words are simply the preparation act. He's already prepared/preparing for the changes, the same way as Hillary's speech was prepared for the debate (perfectly staged - it was the highest craft in my honest opinion - congratulations to her preceptor). She even uses 
her own foundation's fabricated arguments to make us feel that she's in any control of the economy. Like she knew what they're (her old establishment) doing. The moments she didn't speak were the moments where you could see how calculative she was towards Trump, instead towards us. She didn't know how to repair this country for 30 years, damn it! :/ It's an abomination to human intelligence. Don't insult us next time, just please. Stop doing that!

You should really drop a hint at Trump's honesty in almost all of the matters they debated about. That's what makes him more reliable as a president, because someone could finally speak for us, for the very people. Look at Obama - yup - like he helped a lot with his one-sided, dull speeches... His heart was and will always be totally dark if you ask me. He just reads those prearranged texts similarly to a salesman, while staging his own emotions and making some people fall into them - but not all of us are that naive. Sorry, guys. He always neglected the biggest national problems. What Hillary did there, in the debate, was just another example of how extremely prearranged you could get! Even more than Obama! She, instead of trying to let people know how strongly she could be trusted, played her role perfectly like a robot. She acted and still acts like she presumptuously was legit! This is a total and complete insult towards normal people! The very fact of acting like she's even slightly reliable is overwhelming to a healthy conscience! That's just my opinion. And because of that exact fact I despise her. Few days ago she made fun of Trump, saying ""he's gonna' wear his read tie, I'm sure"" while laughing, then - at the debate - she suddenly wore that eye-hurting crimson ensemble. I'm never voting on her, that's a 100% positive here! Not because of her lack of reliability, but because of her anti self-criticism! Trump's got a healthy conscience, that's why he doesn't want to play her mental games anymore - he just wants to move forward with everything - don't you feel the energy he's emanating with? This debate made me sure that what Hillary does best is slowing other people down, instead of healthily speeding her own self up. Throw a rock at me if you think she resonates with positive energy! That's exactly why this debate made me feel proud of that guy Donald. The temper has nothing to do with the lack of self-criticism. Make a note on that. A full vote on Trump here, guys."

I was born in a former communist country and I still live there. We're now part of the European Union and of NATO, but you can still see what the communists did to us. And life is still hard, and salaries are low, and unemployment is high. And yet you Americans are rushing to be just like us.

Are you insane?! I don't care if Donald Trump is orange. Or if he says things that bother you. If the choice is between him and communism, you'd be a fool to choose communism. And make no mistake, what H. Clinton promises is communism. 

Taxes on the rich to give to the poor. Are you insane? This is not Robin Hood. Those rich bastards whom you hate so much actually create jobs. If they don't do it, who will? 

After the United States fought so hard against communism, I can't believe that it's now becoming the USSR. Freedom of speech is already gone with you guys, thanks to the PC culture. The only thing you still need to do is just make everybody poor. And don't expect any other outcome. If you divide the wealth of a nation and give it to everybody, then there's now chance in hell that that nation will increase its wealth. It's simple math. 

If I were a citizen of the United States, I'd never vote anything except Republican. I have never in my life voted for the left and I will never vote for the left. Having the state extra-involved in your business is never a good thing. We had that. All the businesses in my country were controlled by the state. They went down immediately after the fall of communism. It didn't even take long. The right means less taxes, more freedom for businesses, and more for the individual. Stop this socialist bullshit. If you don't want to feed yourself, then others shouldn't have to do it for you. I don't want to pay for those who don't want to work. 

We were poor when the communists were here and we're poor now. And this is your future if you continue to vote for the left.

And the parties are both bought & paid for by SuperPACs, foreign interests, corporations, and lobbyists. We don't even bother to hide it anymore. It's just an accepted fact. Another fact is, if the citizens of the United States would send a message by saying ""no more"" to the two-party system, it would truly change things for the better. Trump is a 3rd-grader playing a video game and has no chance to win. Clinton is a corporatist, de-regulationist, militarist politician who works for her special interests, not the middle/lower class, as she claims. She will change nothing. Educate yourself about other candidates and who will represent YOU, not simply be a vote against the candidate you hate the most. We live in an oligarchy right now, but if the people join together we can make it a democracy again."

Bankrupt from too much fancy-schmancy interior and overbudget from high fuel prices and sold at a loss. His 'Tour de Trump'? Renamed and taken from his control. Six casinos? Bankrupt and sitting in ruin. Trump steaks? Obtusely overpriced AND disgusting, went out of business after one year. GoTrump.com? Sloppily put together, posted cheap rates at dumpy locations and closed down after one year. Trump Mortgage? Started at the beginning of the housing market crash. Oh THAT was smart. Closed down after almost two years in service. Trump freaking Monopoly?! Sold to Milton Bradley on the excuse that his face would sell it and when it didn't, the game was discontinued after, you guessed it! One year. That's just a few failed business ventures. If he can't even keep simple business ventures like a board game going, I genuinely want to know; how does he think he can run a country that's already struggling through severe financial stress, unemployment stress, and with the highest percentage of young people being unable to afford housing in decades, which could eventually lead to yet another housing crash?

UgjbKnc_xmn6SXgCoAEC,TayoEXE,1503349460289,"You know what? Everyone here is using terms like ""clearly"" or ""you're an idiot if you think"" as if your opinion is the only unbiased, fully-supported, opinion on the planet. The reality is that there are reasons why people are choosing the way they are. That has to do with personal values among other things and which candidate seems to support those more. And voting for one or the other does not imply that the person is idiotic or even fully supportive (or supportive at all for that matter) of that candidate. I think I can say for most of us, we are indeed choosing between the lesser of the two evils. Both have their pros, both have their cons (and maybe a lot of cons actually). All of the insults, accusations, judgements, and arrogant attitudes of the commenters here seem to be, ironically enough, the intolerance that each side accuses the other of. If you're going to vote, be informed, be unbiased, and select whomever you think will do a better job. If you truly are trying to meet half way with the same objective, then let it be in helping to unify our nation rather than dividing it. There is already enough hatred, misunderstandings, and other problems we need to face in our country."

UgijKMt17iyLcngCoAEC,Aorie,1503349463917,"Let's be honest with ourselves here, I feel bad for Donald Trump for embarrassing himself in front of billions of people who are following this debate. But before I leave the matter as the trainwreck that it is, I wanted to say that it is painfully obvious to see the big difference between someone who is prepared and someone who is shitting his way through the debate. And is someone who is treating politics as a big joke deserves to be our next president? Someone who underestimates the importance of such a debate, if such is so, then what will happen when he comes into the Oval office and gets to decide on more important issues such as international trade relations, and domestic social and financial justices? Watching the debate, I get this notion that Donald didn't think the debate is important enough for his mighty self to even look up facts, and study his responses. It seems to me that Mr. Trump realized that he was able to get this far by just bullshitting his way through, so why don't he continue doing the same thing that he was doing to win more voters? It seems to me that, Mr. Trump was born with privilege as a young lad, and he doesn't have to work hard for anything-- including this debate, including this next presidency. And though in the beginning, Trump's supporters might be interested in this more radical opponents to iterate their dislike of the current president (though I don't know why anyone would find fault with our current president because you can tell that he and his family put in a lot of efforts to make life better for the typical American, (don't get me wrong, I am not saying that Obama magically make life better for everyone because let's be honest here, not even God can do that) but he works hard to help enough people during his presidency to not deserve the hate that Trump's supporters are throwing at him), and spit out irrational policies and campaign proposals, this debate is where it has to stop. For surely, even Trump's supporters should realize the grave mistake that they made in their chosen candidate. When presented next to Hillary, Trump seemed to be like a child bulldozing topics upon topics that are going nowhere, spilling nonsense that make me feel stupid as I'm trying to figure out what is it he wanted to do, and once in a while, when I got something coherent out of Trump, I realized the policy will crash and burn if it's put into practice. Anyone with a brain can see that, and much of it doesn't need to be said. 
Look, I honestly don't want to vote for either candidate for the upcoming election but at least one of them won't run us into the ground and let the work of our predecessors go to waste.

Ugiw1CIzTyiu93gCoAEC,ThreesharpsA,1503349469410,"Trump missed so many opportunities to remind people what a liar and corrupt person she is. When she insinuated that Trump may not give as much to charities as he wants people to believe, it was the perfect opening to give the people some of the truth about the Foundation, as documented in the movie ""Clinton Cash"". If you wan to really see what the Clintons are about, watch it  http://www.breitbart.com/clinton-cash-movie/

I'm not sure the debates will change that many people's minds, the race is already so polarized. A majority of people know the Clintons are corrupt, self-serving political hacks. People are so eager for someone new, a non-politician, especially when the democrats offer up the ultimate political insider. They may not be fans of Trump, but they don't want more of the Clintons. 

The media has been able to convince a number of people that Trump is unqualified and a joke. What they haven't been able to do yet, is convince enough people that he is untrustworthy,  not charismatic, not a leader. He is all of those things.

It really comes down to one question - Can America be convinced to vote for a proven liar, someone the majority of the people dislike,  or vote for a decent man that will be vilified by the MSM. Someone who will continue the path the country is on, or someone who  will try and stop the bleeding. People are very worried about terrorists being allowed to enter the country and a very serious attack on our soil.  They are very worried about the rising costs of health care (wait till they see the premium hikes coming for 2017), and everything else . All of this economic uncertainty in the face of  stagnant wages and jobs leaving the country. So many people are  very worried about the escalating racial tensions. Everyone I speak with is  very worried about the cost of illegal immigration both in terms of dollars and safety. It's just a freaking mess, anyway you cut it.

Maybe America will vote with their wallet, as they have in the past and vote for change, taking America back - Trump. Maybe they aren't concerned enough to care who wins and the MSM will push in one of the most unqualified people ever to run for the office - Clinton."

It was comical at best, quite funny actually. I have lost all respect for her, even with her taking the blame for the 33,000+ e-mails, as she mentioned earlier in the debate. The United States is definitely in a very bad position, globally speaking. More needs to be done, even if that means to loosen restrictions and regulations in order to promote businesses building and producing employment. In examining political history the only true means of producing employment is by enhancing incentives and¬†in lowering taxes for the business owner, with those incentives being in the form of hiring employees. When more money is working in the economy the greater development will be. This will also result in the form of stabilizing if not bettering the infrastructure."

At 45:25, Trump speaks about introducing the biggest tax reduction ""since Ronald Reagan"".  When Reagan was in power, everybody loved him - and why?  Because life was good.  Why was that?  Because the country was awash with cash.  And where did it come from?  Well, it had a lot to do with the fact that during Reagan's tenure of the White House, America went from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor nation.  Don't believe it?  Try Googling ""Reagan creditor debtor"".  The trillions of debt that Trump now bemoans started with Reagan - but most Americans just remember that life was good while he was in power.  Wake up, Folks, Trump is now threatening a rerun of the same policy that put America on the slippery slope towards the 2008 depression, and left it with trollions of dollars of debt in 2016 - and why would he do this?  ""To make America great again""!  If trump gets into power, America will piss its pants, and have a long, hard Winter to consider its choice.  Following a Trump victory, America will still be regretting it long after he is dead."

European people are facing the same kind of problems, especially in UK. And you know what happened to them after they made the ""right choice"", through democratic procedure.
We are in a similar situation, where increasing number of people support the extreme right. I'm pretty sure it doesn't work as it may sound.

But she absolutely dominated Trump in this debate.  If you were to simply judge both candidates based on their performance for these 90 minutes, it was an unmitigated disaster for Trump.  He started out OK when talking about trade....then slowly the wheels came off until he was reduced to a blubbering idiot delivering half-cocked insults, lies, and word salads.

One of the scariest moments of the first Clinton/Trump debate was Hillary's tactics to deal with ISIS. 
To quote part of Hillary Clinton's answer exactly from the transcripts :
""We're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.‚Äù

Syria is already a total powder keg thanks to Obama's and Hillary's obsession to take out Assad, even after Assad won the election in 2014. People like Obama, Lindsey Graham, Hillary want to put in a no fly zone as they did in Libya! This time, such a move will create WAR WITH RUSSIA, something our generals don't want to happen. For what? So Hillary wants to create more ""Syrian"" refugees to flood into Europe and America? Why would she want to push more throat cutting terrorist into a country she claims she cares about, a county we are about to have nuclear war over? Is she mad? And is the media so blind as not to see pain and misery her ISIS policy would create? I do know that the Bush and Clinton family have made countless millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia who wants to run a pipe line through Syria when it is razed!"

She had nothing to offer, only whats been done before and I hate it... Everything thats been done in last 8 years or even 12 is complete BS. My company laying off people. Insurance went up 2 years ago by 40% and last year another 30+.  People out of work. Prices are crazy. No security... All she said is I am going to continue whats Obama has been doing in the last 8 years. Well.... this is the end. She will raise taxes for top companies... hmm... right... those companies will raise prices for whatever they do.... so who will lose in the end? thats right..  me and you. This is really crazy how politicians think that people are idiots and you can feed them all you want and they eat it.
I think Trump will be either the worst or the best president ever. I have no idea. All I know this country need a change. Not an obama kind of change. 
Think about this... They came to Libya or Iraq saying there is no democracy there. People rules those countries for decades....

Hopefully the American public can see through that. 
The issue that swayed it for me was that Mr Trump doesn't pay federal tax.
Although this could be seen as a negative move for a politician it's a mark of genius for a businessman. When you're 20 trillion in debt you need a businessman, not a politician. It's a shame that elections are essentially a popularity contest and not a job interview in which the best person for the job is selected. 
Let's remember that Mr Trump not paying federal tax is a LEGAL business decision. We all want to be billionaires, to never have to worry about going hungry to build a legacy, that can not be achieved without exploiting legal loopholes ect. And I respect his outright honesty, a rare sight in political debates.
However when probed about deliberately concealing and deleting classified emails an going to some distance to source and maintain a private server Mrs Clinton can simply say ""I made a mistake""?!?! Really?!"

Why can't the majority just vote a third party to see if something huge actually changes this political mess? I'm curious to see if this whole election is rigged in general. I guarantee Hillary is going to win this despite if the majority, vote for Trump because most of the Republican party hate him ( Though not as much as Clinton).

UgiPj8sivMhAi3gCoAEC,aMcSpank,1503349542012,"I here explain how I and Millions of other Americans feel about Donald John Trump.....We don't mind if the man swears . . . or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't mind. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.Our country is a mess because politicians over the years have made it that way. The elected leaders of the Republican Party are so two faced & gutless they can't stem the onslaught against our Constitution by the elected leaders of the Democrat Party, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt and destroy this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't mind that Mr. Trump is crude, not a polished orator, we don't mind that he has changed positions on a few things, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, the bias news media, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Ted Cruz, John Kasich, the Bush family, (Jeb, George W.), Lindsey Graham, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what many of them are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists. They certainly know his. we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out, even though, a great many did, and very successfully.This country has been militarily weakened, we're bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, our friends doubting us. We are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And Donald Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democrat and Republican Parties. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, out of control government spending, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self-serving bills and back room deals, trade deals with foreign countries extremely unfair to us, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing our country, and the phony pay for play money laundering Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and there is a movement underway to change the direction we're taking. Mr. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, created a lot of jobs, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only, and last, chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office and filling the Supreme Court with Socialist judges, and selling our beloved nation for cash are frightening. Mr. Donald Trump, a non-politician, is leading a tidal wave of the American people, non-politicians, and it‚Äôs going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and prevent further decay caused by politicians in an overbearing Federal Government 

P. S. A Pragmatist is: ""One who sees a problem and understands it must be fixed."" ""Skilled in business or law."" Donald Trump is a pragmatist. He doesn't see the problems as Democrat or Republican, Liberal or Conservative. He sees them only as problems and understands they must be fixed."

None of those ended up on any tax statements or returns nor did the last couple of years charitable donations ended up being a part of my tax write offs.  The whole reason to donate isn't for taxes, but to actually help people who need help.   So, if Hillary Clinton thinks tax returns are the one stop shop for how you donate, she is wrong.

He's also donated to their foundation as well as them themselves, and the only thing Trump asked for, was for her to go to his wedding.

A proven track record of disastrous foreign policy, in bed with big business, high probability of selling classified information and a documented history of shady backroom deals through her foundation. Nixon and Watergate looks like a boy scout operation compared to her. An epitome of what's wrong with politics today, and a true professional. So far she's also one of the most fake orators I've seen in a long time. A nice facade but a master of double talk.

Then there is the other candidate, the only true outsider in the race, one that has been selected by actual people in primaries (not by ""superdelegates""). Who's bashed by mass media non stop from the first moment he started to gain momentum. But also one whose style inevitably causes that plenty of people simply won't ever like him. For sure a better and more experienced negotiator when it comes to trade, but a wild card when it comes to diplomacy and public relations.

Anyway, I'm amazed at the staggering bias, the die hard team mentality that makes it almost impossible for most to even slightly accept anything even remotely objective about the candidate they don't cheer for. Which is of course greatly fueled by the fact that there's practically none at least only slightly biased / programmed mass media outlet left. Journalism in the means of its original codex has died in order to serve big business to push their political interests.

So eventually you're likely to have people voting emotionally based on a completely irrational scheme that it's more important what someone says (aka doesn't speak offensive in public) as opposed to what has been proved that someone did during his time in government (evidenced track record of corruption, endangering national security, a key part on some of the most disastrous and short sighted moves in foreign policy etc.).

Don't vote is not an option and Clinton clearly needs to be in prison  so it makes me sad that I will be voting for trump.  He just doesn't seem presidential to me.  I hope he spends more time preparing.  Also I noticed that after the debate basically all the commentators on nbc slammed trump.  I hope American can at least see through this and know that he was at an away game and of course he will get booed.  It comes with the territory it's just he didn't fully prepare himself for this and proved that he could not handle the pressure this time.  I hope he does better next time.

Here's the thing aight, Hillary says she plans on defeating ISIS, well who does America hate more, Bashar Al Assad or ISIS? If ISIS is already trying to take down Assad and the rest of Syria, the quote ""the enemy of my enemy, is my friend"" plays a factor.

She and Obama have been giving American soil to pay for the trillions we owe. Trump would tell them to kiss his ass. That's the attitude we need in the White House. As far as trades go, they're insane. This country use to be the only country others would want to trade with. We were the Giant. Now, because we never charged them for importing their goods into our country, wiping out our factories and taking away our manufacturing companies, we put ourselves in a hole. Trump is totally correct on that point. The only problem with that is if Nike can have their shoes made for a dollar a pair, why would they want to do it for 25?  It's all about greed, no pride, no loyalty to this country. Increasing minimum wage will only increase our debt, yes it will help lower and middle class, but it will be short term, then the jobs will disappear....so why increase? Trump is absolutely correct....Remember this, after years and years of the unions getting increased pay for employees where factory workers were making 18 to 25 an hour....how long did it take for the companies to call it quits here, go overseas and get their products made for pennies. Clinton is only going to continue getting us deeper and deeper until we're begging China for help. If she wins, everyone might want to learn how to speak Chinese, they will own us."

The past 16 years of this nation has made irreconcilable differences between our citizens, allies, and enemies. Everyone wants change, no one wants to do anything about it, thanks to (though necessary) technological distractions and the need and want for our next pay day to go out and be distracted even more. The Roman Emperors called it 'Bread and Circuses' to distract the Roman people from rising up and demanding change at the tip of a sword. I'm ashamed to be a citizen of this nation. I'll probably get a lot of hate for this comment like 'well, what have you done? What are you doing?' .. And that's okay, because I'm guilty of standing by also. I just want people to realize this now. Politicians promise every one the world and then sit inactive and only move for legistlation that benefits their Party, which only furthers the rift between the two party system that needs to be disbanded and buried. Amazing how people can say they don't trust their government, yet argue against each other to which Party they belong to and why said Party is better and 'more American'... Spoiler alert: Neither are more American, neither care about you, neither will bring constructive change, it will only get worse from here. The die is cast. There's no coming back, no coming prosperity, no healing the social and economic decimation done to this nation and the world. War is coming. If you don't know history then you don't know what I mean. Things are just like pre ww1 and ww2 except now with more tension. The only reason it's been delayed is because nuclear weapons will be used, and no one wants to be the one to be known as the 'shot heard around the world' first.. People ask why war happened in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria... Why the Arab spring happened and leaders who kept the chaotic and confusing Middle East in moderate peace, from Libya to Egypt, Yemen and Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.. Tunisia.. Etc.. Power plays that will determine the resources acquired for something you all hear everyday, 'National Security.' Yep, meaning we can't allow our 'enemies' to have them, WE need them. It's West vs. East. Captalism and a false 'Democracy' against Communism, Socialism, and Islam. If you can't see the puzzle being formed yet, I envy your ignorance, because it is bliss. How restful it must be to be driftwood in this day and age. Remember this comment, copy and paste it, save it some where. Because mark these words, war is coming, within 10 years this world will be at war, from November of this year, until 2026, irreversible events will happen culminating in the complete and utter destruction of nations and this Earth.

If a voter prioritize speeches and neglect current PUBLIC SERVICE ACTIONS and current REAL EVENTS, it is the voter's will....

USA borders got an open borders alright (welcome ILLEGALs, you got the patrons of the current governmment) - thru all these years elected politicians neglected - the flow of ILLEGALs and the burdens it brought to USA of spending $110billion+ annually to support it. Be good to neighbors, patrons called racism as issues to cover political neglect that even the cancer of weak security and extreme negligence went to the walls of White House and go to desks of extremely negligent Secretary of State. What can security serve to a lowly citizen of USA? Well Obama government under its noses Snowden (showed distrust on the leadership) and hacked. Snowden actions revealed the poorest and weakest system of the negligent Obama government. It is also revealed the distrust of the Obama/Clinton government against its own people. What a legacy?

Don't believe the bullshit that you'll scare them all away if you raise their taxes. They pay effectively a 0% rate here, less than ANYWHERE else in the world. We're talking about the HUGE companies here, not your dad's hardware store or your uncle's construction business or landscaping business, etc. Politicians use these fear tactics because they work for the international corporations that own everything. This is a corporatist economy, NOT a capitalist one. Politicians are all on the take; we know that now. Study the government just a little bit to know this is the truth. Here's some homework: watch ""Requiem for the American Dream"" currently on Netflix. Watch that and see if you can disagree with any of it. This documentary features a man who has been saying this for 30 years already. All of his major predictions have come true. Nobody listened to him‚Äîor, I should say, the people who listened to him didn't have much power to do anything to change the problems we face. We are currently on the precipice of losing all our voting power forever. Once either of these jerkoffs becomes President, none of our votes will ever matter again. Hillary will give us the TPP which will give international corporations power over sovereign nations like our own, so what voters want will not matter because it will be overruled by international corporate law.

UgjD7yremdVCSXgCoAEC,Ryan Sheridan,1503349678405,"There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the way the current presidential debates are handled, so I've been thinking about what we should change it to. Before I begin I should note that this is similar to the Oxford style debating Intelligence Squared uses. So first off we add a 4th debate and run it on PBS or The CW, and we invite both the presidential Candidate and the Vice Presidential candidate. Then we choose topics that are more prone to debating, or that allow for more in depth policy. We could get some of these by asking your average Joe what they would like to hear about and/or asking YouTube stars to submit 3 or 4 questions, then the moderators select a few questions to showcase. Before we start we take a poll to see what side people are on/what candidate they are going for). Now the actual debate would start off with 4 to 6 uninterrupted minutes for each side together to discuss what their opinion is. After that each candidate together get a few minutes for rebuttal of the other person's arguments. Then we open the floor for them to argue with each other (moderators stepping in when necessary). Then we move on to some of the people in the audience (or on Twitter) asking questions about what the other person's argument was. Final we have a short closing statement. Then we take a second poll to see how many minds got changed. Obviously there are flaws (for example you take up a lot of time for every question), but this is just a basic possible outline."

And, WHY are all the people involved in the email scandal except one pleading the 5th? What does she have to hide?? Why did they wipe the server clean, including the use of Bleach Bit. Why did Comey make a public announcement of all the rules she broke then claim nobody would prosecute the findings in court? Why did Lynch publicly state she will take whatever Recommendation the FBI gives, then does it without ANY investigation themselves, after privately meeting with Bill Clinton?? Idc How Trump runs his business's he's making money! And to think of that Brain being in the Whitehouse, after Obama has destroyed this country and more than double the US Debt, has me ecstatic! We need to recoup the TRILLIONS Lost during this 8 year racially fed lame duck administration. Hillary, Obama, Holder Lynch, Cummings, Lerner, Huma, Paliagano, Comey, they all deserve to be in prison... Build America back up! This Administration has failed the people and created a Huge divide between races, starting with the 08' Campaign video where Obama Directly addressed the black race, then after endorsing Hillary, who he said on numerous occasions was unfit for the oval office, then stated Black people would show him a huge disrespect by voting for Trump.

She nods her head a lot when she talks, and has a high blink rate. The blinkrate is sometimes irregular. Trump also blinks a lot, but seems to squint more intermittently. His blink rate drops when he goes off script, I posit.
Both of their heads are flanked with the words ""Right...People"", which was certainly decided by someone. Are secret messages imbedded behind their heads? Probably not.

I'm not saying to forget our cultures, cultures are great and helps us be unique but acknowledgment of different skin color, positive or negatively, is why racism still exist.  The more people realize that we are all the same the faster racism will die. That includes not having a black history month and not letting our race be an excuse for not doing things or using our race to play the victim card.

He had so many opportunities to point to the facts that Killery and Obama CREATED ISIS for their banister puppeteers, and he barely touched one. I don't think he's even aware of the criminality that has been this harpy's trademark all the way back to when she was kicked off the Watergate investigation for unethical behavior. She would definitely be the death knell for our country, playing the role of slave to the CFR, AIPAC and the other Zionists who have used the criminal banking cartel to run the world's economy into the ground. Any monkey would serve us better than she. But Trump revealed what I feared all along. He knows nothing about the insidious, underhanded dealings the U.S. government has been practicing for the last 103 years. What a shame. I only wish it was Dr. Paul on that stage. Perhaps this will encourage Trump to fire some more advisors and get Cynthia McKinney and Ron Paul working on his campaign. He needs a hard dose of facts. Still, if it came down to Killery and King Kong, I'd still vote against her. Once again, we are left with voting against the worst instead of for the best."

Clinton's policies on the otherhand, benefits the lower and middle income groups and tries to redistribute the incomes across the economy such that there will be a more equitable income distribution. Development of small and medium enterprises will greatly benefit USA. Govt spending on education will also raise quality of America's workforce.. which is very bad at the moment.

Singapore may be small, but good leadership makes us one of the strongest country despite our size. We Singaporeans know what and who we are voting for. And Clinton is the best choice for America.

BUT, THE MAIN PROBLEM IS, Hilary Clinton is not an expert speaker, and knows less how to tackle questions and acquisitions. On the other hand, Trump is actually expert in small talks, which catches the attention of people but ultimately seems futile. 

Trump is thinking supporting the top 1% of the economy will help the bottom 90%. That doesn't bring balance. While workers might get new jobs of $10-12/hr, companies will profit in millions, which will further increase the wealth gap."

Also, I guess Trump is the only one who gets fact checked, another command of the Clinton machine. Hillary got to say whatever she wanted, most of it wrong....and...nothing. I think Trump did well under the circumstances. Hillary on the other hand, is just as terrible as always.  She has no vision for her campaign, and her plans are totally wrong.   One more thing. You cannot raise taxes on the wealthy and fix ANYTHING, they will move the money offshore, OR they will just pass it down on the middle class in the form of more expensive goods and services. Trump wanting to cut taxes on business is a great idea, along with cutting spending and cutting regulations. They will save money that will go back into their companies to expand, and hire. One more last one more thing. Hillary saying that she wants to have a revenue sharing plan? Uh, that's called a paycheck stupid. Government should stay out of it!  P.S. In case you think I am some kind of right wing kook...sorry,  I am a liberal democrat who voted for  Obama 2x (yes, her campaign started the birther thing)....But I will not vote for a Hillary. She is a neocon war hawk who has been wrapped in greed and scandal forever. She is old news. An anachronism....America would no survive even one term with her as President."

If you don't pay taxes because you are doing something that is ""illegal"" - tax fraud or tax evasion - that's a crime.  But if you take advantage of any deductions that you are ""LEGALLY"" entitled to receive - that indeed is ""smart"".   Any citizen or business should do that.   From one news article:

The tax bracket system might be practical for the lower & middle class, but for the elite echelon of the upper class, maybe there should be a system of evaluating how you operate in the market, and being eligible for a slashed tax rate. So if you can be shown as someone who is looking to invest in new or expanding business, you get taxed lower.

I don't understand why Clinton keeps blaming the housing bubble collapse on everyone but her husband, Bill Clinton who dreamed up and set the housing bubble collapse firmly in motion.
Young black men who are the product of Democrat sponsored single mothers are the single biggest  cause of black violence and homicide, not guns.   Instead of just assuming bias and giving bias counseling to police officers, (additional training would be better than counseling) focusing on the moral bankruptcy and culture of violence that is the black culture would be a far more effective route.

Honestly when 'i' think about our economy, and the price of everyday electronics and consumers in the country; trump is not really right on companies leaving and paying their fair share. How? Those big companies basically live on the 'New York stock exchange', and you have to ask yourself. Do the stock exchange companies really pay their fair share? Maybe or Maybe not. Anything is possible, but what isn't possible is having Hilary Clinton as president making a change in history while negatively impacting our economy. Honestly i hate to say it, but when it comes down to a choice of presidency for 2016 you want a candidate that is honest and has integrity Hilary has none of that. She avoided her email and Benghazi claims up until now. We can't afford to have another 'administration leader that makes mistake, because when you make mistakes in an administration that is so huge and heavily funded you fail to lead and you have no good results other than corruption which seems to be good to the past and current administrations.

UgiEHluiDnK5T3gCoAEC,The Stern Dragoon,1503349831167,"GIGANTIC, OVERUSED RED FLAG ALERT:

Trump's proposal to ""cut red tape"" will NOT incentivize companies that do hand-over-fist profits overseas. Reaganomics was an ABJECT FAILURE in economics with repercussions we still see in the massive income inequality that has gotten so out of hand it has destabilized the economy as a whole.  There is NO MONEY ""stuck"" overseas. NONE. That money is in the pockets of the 1% and their tax shelters and, incase you had to be told this, it's 100% by their CHOICE. This was CAUSED by Republican deregulation in the 70s and 80s and the floodgates are open. There is no going back. It's an epidemic of sheer soulless greed and the only thing you can do to even ATTEMPT to equalize their 100000% markups and pure profit margins is to RE-REGULATE and TAX them. These aren't companies that need to outsource because they can't afford the American equivalent. These are superwealthy scumbags who decided to take advantage of this gross human rights violating loophole so they could make absurd profits.

IF you're a right winger and you have EVER believed in the ""billionaires create jobs"" bullshit, I implore you to look up FRANK LUNTZ.  He's a linguist propagandist and he's responsible for the Fox News tauted buzzwords that Republicans spew from their mouths at every opportunity. He INVENTED the ""job creators"" term for CEOs who largely do theri business through outsourcing to try to drum up more trust for the worst Americans we have to contend with (unless you believe you can ethically or morally justify taking jobs away from Americans to have them done by Vietnamese 7 year olds for NO REASON other than simple gross profit.)  He's also responsible for the ""Death Tax"" (millionaire estate tax), ""Energy Exploration"" (Fracking and ""clean coal"") and ""Climate Change"" (Human exacerbated global warming).  Even if you subscribe to any of these terms and the GOP stance on them, don't you at least feel a LITTLE manipulated and played by him and the RepubliCONs?"

Often, he disregarded the moderator's question all together in favor of explaining some ""tremendous problem"" in America that he has a ""tremendous solution"" to. In fact, he rarely gives any specifics to aforementioned solution, its implementation, or its goals and outcomes. But, I could deal with all of this vacuum cleaner salesman rhetoric if two of his actual verbalized propositions weren't ""Reaganomics"" and ""Stop and Frisk."" Trump paraded about these ideas that have not only been recognized as wholly damaging to the economic structure and outright unconstitutional respectively, but he does so in complete disregard of the horrifying effects of both on very specific racial and socioeconomic groups. Anyone ( Trump supporters included) who were alive for, or have educated themselves about the tax cuts of Reagan and their outcomes should be horrified [barring, of course, anyone who is of the upper class (such as the Donald himself)]. And anyone of color who lived through or read about New York's stop and frisk policy should be outraged with the idea of a national unconstitutional policy proposal (although it would most likely stop there).

He's rich, he only wants to help and protect rich people.

It's the biggest scam ever, and all these politicians know it but are afraid to say or do anything about them because of the incredible power they have. Every dollar they print is debt, and that's where the government gets their money, so how can you pay off a debt if the money you use is more debt? You can't. The government needs to arrest every executive affiliated with the fed, along with the Rockefeller, Rothechilds and so on, sieze all their assets and put it in the US treasury and start printing our own debt free money again. And that's just the beginning. Then the president, being the commander in chief, should take the army into these black op bases, that won't even tell the president what they are doing, and take all the zero point energy technology so that everyone can use it.

What's important now is getting America out of debt. We cannot go on anymore with who speaks better or or who has met with other countries more. I want this country back, more jobs created, and less money going out of the country. Most of all block anyone from entering this country unless they are creating jobs and keeping money in America. God bless us all!"
UggU-Z_MBsxiB3gCoAEC,Jackie Walker,1503349920477,"I wish people would remember what set off the great crash of 2007-2008... you know, the housing bubble crash? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were basically set up by Democrats during the Clinton administration, putting pressure on banking institutions to loan money to folks would otherwise wouldn't qualify for home loans. They KNEW the people didn't qualify, and they forced mortgage lenders to do it anyway. Prices in the housing markets skyrocketed, and then when the whole thing collapsed it was George W. Bush got to take the blame for it. It blew up at the the end of his term, but he did NOT cause it. In fact, the Obama administration has been blaming Bush for everything ever since. Well, as bad as the national debt was under Bush, it has skyrocketed under Obama, and the economy has NOT recovered his ""leadership,"" and everyone knows it. If it wasn't for the media spin, this last 8 years would have been called the second Great Depression. But the media spin is there, and therefore, it is merely the Great Recession. <sigh> 

     The fact the Bernie Saunders and Donald Trump have done so well in this election cycle speaks to the fact that the people of this nation are tired of the way politics as usual are done. Washington bureaucracy wastes more time and money, and introduces more regulations that interfers with the abilities of Americans to either run their businesses or start new ones. The best way to run this country is to FOLLOW the Constitution! The Federal government was never intended by our Founders to be as large as it has grown to be. There are a few basic reasons the Federal government was founded, and the Preable to the Constitution lists them quite clearly: 1) form a more perfect Union, 2) establish Justice, 3) insure domestic Tranquility, 4) provide for the common defense, 5) promote the general Welfare, 6) secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. The powers and limits placed on each of the 3 branches of government are clearly defined in the Constitution, and frankly, the Executive branch and the Judicial branch have greatly over-reached their Constitutional powers. And up until the last 60 years or so, Judges (even those on the Supreme Court) who misbehaved while sitting on the bench were subject to IMPEACHMENT for their behavior, even for behavior away from their courtrooms. Seriously, folks, we need to start demanding upright and moral behavior from our ""public servants."" They are NOT our masters... they work for US!!!

     The only candidate I've seen recently who doesn't seem to care about being politically correct, or in the hands of the lobbyists, is Donald Trump. He is also the only one largely paying for his own campaign. Is it really any wonder he is so popular? His primary opponent is quite well known for lying and committing treason, endangering American lifes without caring who was in danger. And now we know why the FBI investigation went nowhere... Obama too was using her private email server using a pseudonym. So if the FBI investigation had been allowed to proceed to an indictment, it would have implicated the President of the United States, and that just cannot be allowed. Big Surprise! 

     Ha! <sigh>"

She has the potential to diminish the racial tensions through this way of speaking.  Donald is clear cut and does not make himself relatable at all throughout the debate.  This does not do well, however, he chooses to incorporate people or experts on subjects within his debate which should help him, but the way he speaks clearly elevates him instead of humbling his demeanor.  He knows better on how to run the business side of the country.  Middle class businesses might work for an isolated region of the world.  They seem more family and community oriented, but they don't have to be.  Still, they will never shape our country like international corporations which are leaving our nation.

They do this by abusing workers and giving away subsidies, but we cannot stop them. If we charge import taxes, then our prices on common goods will skyrocket and sales taxes will hit the poor and middle class hard. Who in their right mind would recommend raising prices and taxes for billions for employment for a few millions? Absolutely insane.

Can barely even hear the question come up before trump or clinton interrupts him to try and make the other seem worse than them.  I noticed clinton was trying to focus on the question at first. But that quickly went away and both of them just started basically attacking each other with a few information pertaining to the actual question every now and then. New question, clinton starts to answer question, then turns into a 30 min argument that is 90% fighting and 10% answering question. Trump tries to answer a question, he tip toes around it and rarely actually tries to answer the question, then also goes into a large fight without actually answering the question.
Doesn't matter who is winning the election from these two America is screwed.

Trump spoke of giving incentive to jobs lowering taxes and putting the working class back to work. We all know people who have lost jobs due to them going overseas. Cheaper to make parts in another country then it is here. Yet Hillary refused to say that was wrong and she refused to say that money rolls up as well as down. Support jobs only work when they have people to support that are making money , producing a product and being a part of the machine that is the nation. Hilary is out of touch with the people but so are most people in Washington these days. Hillary spoke from a script she seemed drugged up and she brought up facts that had nothing to do with the debate. He said or she said and from friends and so forth like a two-year-old. ""Well my mom's friends said"". Who cares for this is a debate. She kept doing this and why was she not called out on it? Shameful and it set the stage showing that she thought it was funny and it was not. We need to empower the people who have a dream. I had a dream , small business and big as well so they hire more people and put us back on a track of production for nobody works nobody can buy. Trump said it best we need to bring jobs back to the country. We need to invest in space in the next west in forward thinking.

For those who say Hillary won the debate, they are right. The only thing she has going for her is that she could be considered more legitimate than Donald Trump. To try and use that to her advantage, she's going to attack him on whatever she can, large or minute. In the case of this debate, it was the minute. If I had to guess, Trump is planning on going on the offensive in the final debates, bringing up all the crap she wouldn't want you to think about (i.e. emails, the fact she represents a broken system, previous comments, and scandals).

    I was in the middle of who to vote for, but now I am voting for Hillary for President!!!!
    Donald is so threatened by Hillary that most of the questions that he is asked he has to attack Hillary for some thing that is not even related to the question.
    I think it is funny how Hillary just laughs at Donald Trump for all the ** he just makes up.  Donald Trump can not even control him self. Donald Trump can not even answer the questions that are asked. He does not even know what to say so he just puts blame on others instead of coming up with solutions.
    Trickle down Trump. Hillary wants to help people. Donald wants to help rich people so the rich people can decide what to do with the money.
    Donald Trump said he wants big business to expand and some how create new small businesses. You can't do both! Big business take up most small businesses business.
   Donald Trump said he wants Hillary Clinton to release the emails. the whole point with the emails is that the emails could be hacked into so people could see them. That is why the emails were bad in the first place. Does Donald Trump want the whole world to see these emails? That would be treason!
  Donald said the not paying Federal Taxes makes him smart!
  Donald thinks every thing that he says is true and honest and accurate.  https://twitter.com/factcheckdotorg how about you decide what is true and honest and accurate.
  Donald thinks he talks for the people. I'm pretty sure people can talk for them selves. What he needs to do is actually listen. He most definitely does not speak for me!!! how about you?
  Donald puts blame on other people for the lies he tells. Saying this is what some one told him. Does he believe every thing some one tells him?
  Why is Donald so insecure about him self and his abilities that he has to keep saying lies about him self to make him self feel better?
 Donald said we are a third world country. Is that how he sees America? 
  ---Donald needs to release all sources that he stated in this debate!- I'm sure that they do not exist.
  Donald said that the roads and bridges are fine then he says couple minutes later that we need new ones!!!
  Donald talks like Hillary is the current person in charge and some how every thing bad is her fault. Why does he think that? She does not defend her self for the reason that she wants to have a debate and not a tug of war game with Donald.
  Donald is a criminal 1:03:00 and he did not argue about that unlike most this Hillary stated. He takes advantage of the laws of the nation for him self and that is what he does. 
  Does Donald want to tell people what to do and what to buy? 1:05:30 Does Donald have people that can control the USA Military budget? How much experience does Donald have with the USA Military budget?
 1:08:45 Donald states that Hillary does not want to ""use"" two words, law and order. Hillary just described law and order!!!
  1:09:00 lol Donald can't remember two recent shootings so he says ""I could just name them all day long.""
   1:21:30 Classic Donald not being able to answer a question and classic avoidance that he is afraid to face is many many many many mistakes.
   1:24:35 Donald is just some old angry racist.
   1:31:25 Does Donald think boarder control can help with cyber security? What is he even talking about? I don't think he knows what he is saying half the time. lol, we need to do cyber better. lol. Donald is a hack.
   1:36:30 Donald complains about Hillary wile he sits there and does nothing.
    Donald is like a 5 year old arguing with his dad. 1:42:05
    1:48:30 Hillary just said the number one threat is nuclear then Donald mumbles some thing about how she thinks it global warming.  Then later says he agrees with Hillary that nuclear is the number one greatest threat.  What is wrong with Donald Trump? is it dementia or narcissism or some thing else? He wants paid for helping other people when they do not ask for it? That is called a scam!

UggSuToBpuw2AHgCoAEC,Serah Steel,1503350034865,"[My thoughts about this] I think Trump just keeps talking and a big mouth and acts way too power hungry. Both Hillary and Trump has their faults, but by the end of this election im putting my vote on Hillary, she wont be as quick to cause wars upon nations and people we are neutral with, unlike trump, he will threaten our safety by being overly aggressive, and money hungry to act as the bigger man. Hillery at least talks about peace and prosperity, about education program being supported, more jobs, and understanding of our allies to keep along our treaty. 

All I can see is that Trump with him over running his mouth during big moments (if he was president) will cause an unnecessary hatred upon America and Americans (which he's already done for himself with latinos and muslims) and if he continues this he'll do the same to China and or other nations/races that we didn't need to get in a fight/war with. He thinks too much of his ""big business's and money"" as key to controlling anyone and everyone, rather he doesn't think of mutual respect and prosperity, especially if he gets overly aggressive by ""taunting"" and acts to blow them up. 

He'll cause wars and we need to start ending them instead of provoking fights. Im not saying Hillary is perfect, but at least with her as commander and chief of America, we'd have less chance of pissing off other nations and I believe in Hillery's economy values and what she wants for America, over what Trump is trying to say with his big business money hungry attitude. [If anyone wants to respond and debate with others, feel free too, I am not here to start unnecessary cursing and arguments. It's just my opinion and outlook about what I think about Trump and Hillary.]"

UggQ6A-Dm5-f1ngCoAEC,Wrestler X,1503350046528,"SERIOUS QUESTION ABOUT TRUMP: First off let me just say that I am NOT by any means in support of Hillary. After all it's because of people like her and her husband that we have the whole mess with NAFTA where all of our jobs can and are being shipped overseas. As bad as that is, my question has more to do with something that was proposed by Trump, and specifically that was also proposed and implemented by Bush and was a very big contributor to the 2008 great recession, by the way. If you haven't already guessed, it happens to be the tax breaks that Trump proposed tonight for the wealthiest Americans, which he himself claimed will (ALLEGEDLY) enable and/or encourage wealthy executives to create and keep jobs in this country as opposed to shipping them overseas. However, there is a giant loophole in this proposal, one which every republican since Clinton has apparently failed to acknowledge (keeping in mind that NAFTA didn't exist prior to Clinton, and so the outsourcing jobs thing for the most part would not have been an issue). At any rate, they are overlooking the fact that, as with Bush, the companies/wealthy executives/CEOs have had zero accountability to create jobs in this country in lieu of the tax breaks. Basically, it's as if they can take the tax breaks and then still continue to ship jobs overseas on top of it without any law or anything legal put in place to stop them. I know this to be the case because it was done under Bush, hence the reason why jobs were still being outsourced under Bush even AFTER he gave tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. What I am basically asking is will there be any accountability under Trump for companies to create and keep jobs in this country in exchange for the tax breaks. I did not once hear Trump talk about this during the debate, and it just scares me to death that we will have the same thing happen again like it did with Bush."

Hillary is fake, a phony, a liar, and I don't trust her. Also, she could very well not like Black people as well. But since she's a Democrat, I guess that automatically means she supports Black people?! Also, she might be more tactful in not revealing her true attitude toward Black people as do most other Democrats do.

Learn business and taxes before commenting so you don't look like a jackass please (friendly advice).

Trump said he's smart for not paying any federal taxes because he knows how to do his taxes (unlike most of you children who probably never touched taxes in your life.) So stop trying to make him out to be evil for being smart.

He send jobs overseas because America is failing you retards. That's being a smart businessman. If he kept all his companies here with our crippled economy and failing policies he would be bankrupt. He's smart (smarter than you and I) and knows how to make businesses work. His plan now is to fix America so that companies don't have to leave the country just to survive.

UghYU15GuG8AZ3gCoAEC,onseau,1503350077425,"IMO Hillary got owned, even though it seemed like Trump was holding back...  

He didn't even comment on her email scandal during the cyber-security question?!?  Also no comments about Bill during Hillary's sexist rant (Still, I love Bill Clinton, doesn't matter what he does.  He could publicly hump the Statue of Liberty and I'd still vote for him as President).  And ironically, wouldn't it be sexist to not insult women that insult you, since it'd be implying that they're not on an equal playing field?

Lester Holt was even more terrible than expected.  Not even intelligent enough to mask his obvious bias.  He should be banned from media, and then farted on.  

Still, it was surprising that Hillary was able to last the whole time without her limbs spontaneously falling off or suddenly bleeding out of every orifice, or whatever the next step is in her fatal progression of every STD known to woman."

My take: The whole debate was Rocky (The Original). Hillary was the seasoned champion (Apollo Creed) everyone expected to win (and she did); Trump was Balboa, the Primitive, the Instinctive. He went the distance, but, whoa --at what a cost! Landed some good punches but took a beating! Both contestants scored some points, both had scars. In the end, however, the Experienced Champion came out on top. Maybe, once upon a time, that was why Bill felt justified in straying from the reservation: Hillary always had to be on top.

UgimeWSyBizss3gCoAEC,Lancerelliott Productions,1503350084566,"Winners and Losers:

Winner:

1). Hillary Clinton- Hillary Clinton‚Äôs experience shined throughout this debate, but not in the way many expected. Sure, Clinton was knowledgeable about the issues. She had her plans and details, but where she shined was in tone. While Trump was erratic and all over the map with his answers, Clinton controlled the conversation. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs debate experience was obvious.

This debate is where Hillary Clinton benefitted from the Democratic primary. Clinton‚Äôs debates with Bernie Sanders gave her the tough one on one debating experience that was clearly lacking in Trump. Hillary Clinton was head and shoulders above Trump in this debate. She turned Trump into a weak counter puncher who was stuck in his talking points.

Hillary Clinton needed to stand across from Trump on stage and confirm her stature as presidential. She did exactly that, while Trump was stripped of his side show and revealed to be in way over his head.

2). Lester Holt ‚Äì Holt did not allow either candidate to ramble, and where Trump was concerned, he pressed the Republican nominee on releasing his tax returns, dropped the facts on stop and frisk, and held both candidates on topic and to the clock.

There was a great deal of concern before the debate that Holt would allow Trump to run wild, or hold him to a lower standard than Hillary Clinton. The NBC Nightly News anchor was a fair moderator who relied on facts and set the standard for how moderators need to conduct themselves in future debates.

Losers:

1). Donald Trump ‚Äì Trump had a bad debate on every level. Stripped of audience and ability to freewheel, Trump was flailing and responding to Clinton. Trump botched a question about his tax returns. He used Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails in a defensive manner. Instead of attacking Clinton, Trump was the reactionary candidate."

But it's an economic theory. It's not even actually applied yet so it's just a hypothesis. She claims that independent economists agrees that her policy will create jobs and decrease debt. She even provided a number. What are the sources of these numbers?

Remember that time that she claims she submitted 90%+ of her emails? That was a blatant lie. Just because you provide numbers doesn't make it true.

I'm not a Trump supporter but to see someone provide numbers on an economic theory just sounds sketchy to me.

Trump did not look good in this debate.

Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."

What about when she was first lady? Remember those things Bill put her in charge of that completely failed, and her being secretary of state? Where she jeopardized the Nation's security with that server and those 30,000+ emails? What about her achieving absolutely nothing important during her career? Oh, what about her not being able to walk up stair by herself and leaving the 9/11 memorial? It still surprises me how people can even believe a word that comes out of her mouth.

[beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
