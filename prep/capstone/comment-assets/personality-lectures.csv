We have to clean up our room and God's room and the whole universe before we are done and if we don't, we suffer and get chased under the bed by the Terrible Mother, a bed that has all the boogie men imagination can conjure.  So we promise to change our reality... and reality is giving us the tools to change reality and we say ""Hey, hold on reality!  You have been torturing me for quite a while now, giving me tools with no instruction manuals and now I don't know if you are real or not...  except for the pain, which tells me you are real... a real bastard trying to improve me with ""Tough Love.""

The letter is not a letter but something that contains all our projections.  So you can say the world contains all our projections, all our attempts at framing some kind of meaning.  But this is the land of in sanity.  Cause everything is real and nothing is real.  Everybody projects what they want.  The person holding it thinks it is from the university.  The person looking over the guy's should and see the letter thinks it is his letter from his sweet heart, the mailman delivering the letter thinks it is a bill... so what is it?  It is everything and nothing.

This is starting to appear very post modern.  Everything is relative there is no truth.

Pattern is the object people see.  We can not see meaning.  Meaning arises after the pattern but the pastern has to make sense to provide a meaning and it does so quickly (a recognition) that we are not conscious of it."

UgwMxz8vgfTxAo253_d4AaABAg,Mister S,1509755273704,"hi dr. peterson.
i have a problem and i was wondering if i could get a response from you.
i know i'm a hyper intellectual person and i have a very wide grasp on reality. and based on the definition which you gave to schizophrenia that a person can't control their perception and find meaning in many experiences of event of their reality, i find myself too prone to that and well it's a little overwhelming in some senses because i'm a medical student and practice for myself psychoanalysis and psychology and i have read many thinkers such az nietsche,dostoyevski,jung,frued (and etc) and actually put myself to examine my life through the lenz with which these thinkers viewed their world. this out take on reality gives me a sharp and sometimes absurd and pessimistic perception of myself and the others around me (and of course most of the time my view about their motives and their behind the action thought processes are right) and that's a view on reality that is destructive for a person and is some kind of apple of eden and one cannot shift his view if one sees what is about to come of a event despite the fact that this view could potentially put harm to them.
and my main problem now is drug abuse which is most constant with weed and this drug puts my perception in a boost on checking reality and searching deeper for the intentions behind the action of people and the feeling of grasping a set of system about another person mind and motives is a wonderful feeling and i know human mind cannot simply put this feeling aside and live a life. 
i also tried LSD and a drug named Dextrometorphan which is a NMDA antagonist and to put it simple it acts like ketamine a dissociative at the same time some psychedelic trip and is a far more complex drug psychologically than any other drugs which i got a hold on them.
but these habits are making me melancholy most of the time and i have a sense of triumphant all of the time which is making me very egocentric. 
I don't know how i can go on living and its tearing me apart . but it's at the same time too much beautiful to let go of the path of truth of other peoples and myself reality. i don't know how i can handle this problems but i know you have had some of these problems yourself and i was wondering if you could help me.
btw i'm from IRAN and unfortunately i don't have much to be able to support you or donate a little but i love your work and as dostoevsky said ""poverty is not a vice"" .

best wishes Dr. B Peterson and much love."

Кто случайно сюда забрел
И бродит без цели, навострив ушки,
На сто тысяч лет я вперед изобрел
Метафизические ловушки,
Расставив их тут и там,

And I have seen people make stands for jewelry out of a dry piece of wood and it 's amazing.

Ugi5LBYqdcP6C3gCoAEC,Waylon Flinn,1504484898922,"In my mind science, and the objectification it creates, are about establishing invariants. First, it established invariants across the experience of separate individuals. Second, it sought invariants across time and space (after those concepts were identified as foundational). In that sense I would say that ""objectification"" is not a single thing. It is a collection of things defined by the set of invariants across which it operates.

Furthermore, if we experience meaning directly, we experience it not as a singular meaning, but instead as a plurality, a set of potential meanings. One of the functions of science, and observation in general, is to reduce this plurality of meaning to a singular or near singular set of meanings. This reduction of meanings yields power over the environment.
 
Paradoxically, that power over the environment then leads to an even greater multiplicity of meanings. Since each object can now be manipulated in a greater number of ways, producing a greater number of possible outcomes. I would further posit that fear and anxiety are a direct result of the indeterminate multiplicity of meanings. The greater the number of possible meanings, the greater the level of fear and anxiety. In this way technology (the power yielded by science) leads to both nihilism and totalitarianism."

I can see from both sides of the argument, and the ideas presented are useful tools, but I have to come down on Dr. Harris's side in terms of the most efficient understanding of the world, and truth. Knowing how human beings model that internally, what little engines and personalities in the mind pre-digest the world for us, doesn't change that.

I keep coming back to the idea of a simulated world. If you're a player, you see the entire game in terms of how it affects you, but if you're the programmer, you always find the idea of objects as a more minimal representation. It's all about what's more interesting to you: the streams of your own possibilities, or modeling the world itself in the most simple way.

If you're solipsistic, the whole world is about understanding the self. But if you're social or a scientist, thinking of the world in terms of objects is always going to be the more efficient representation of how to think about possibilities."

It's like, no it's not.  Naive realism is not naive at all.  In fact naive realism is more nuanced than the schools of abstraction that scoff at it's seemingly insipid position.  We are apart of that real world and our interpretive instruments and wiring is not an alien imposition. It is part of the dance.  It is part of the soup. You can't say cars don't really travel at high speeds, it is the imposition of a gas engine that make you think that way.  That is what is means to be a car.  It is a vehicle with an engine.  Sure you can disturb that image with abstraction in order to fix a problem or subject it to examination for improvements.  However this is the REAL alien procedure.  THIS IS THE FABRICATION.  The dissection of concepts and meaning.  Just because you can break something down, does not mean the composite parts are more truer than the compound from which it came from.

Scar was blessed with intelligence, instead of ""brute force"" which is how religion selects its rulers for the people to worship. It was the monkey which took the throne from Scar and gave it to Mustafa. When the monkey split the fruit, holy sacrament, the corona which it created was religion acting as the authority of some divine being expressed in the monkey which gave hereditary monarchy the right to rule by anointment or by appointment. We see throughout history monarchs painted with some reference of heavenly inspiration in the form of a halo or the association with dragons in reference to the east. The perception of the church which is reflected in the monkey is somewhat relative to reality, the animals bowed to the monkey before they bowed to the lions looking down upon them, the monkey climbs up instead of walking up which is how the lions navigate this structure. The monkey hugged the lion, yet the bird bowed to the lion. The church would have you assume, their responsibility is one of being humble and duty bound, but in reality. It was the monkey which created the environment in which order is established, for the king who ruled by force to subjugate the masses and they automatically acts out because they were trained to assume it was divinely inspired, by the will of god. Who is more powerful, the one who wears the crown or the one who places the crown on the head which carry it. One of the more revered animals to the Egyptians, were bees like the ants. Who ruled by another means, pheromones as a result cities were born."

Professor Peterson, why dont you mention the grotesque depiction of the spotted hyena in this movie?  I mean no matter how good the symbolism and archetypes of this movie are, if its built on PROVEN wrong assumptions about things or creatues (like the hyena) then its really devaluing the message of it.

Hyenas are devoted mothers, have stable societys built on hierachy, competence and rituals and hunt 10 times more than they scavenge. No matter what size, a hyena clan would never attack an adult male lion. Everything depicted and said about hyenas is bullshit except that they can break bones with their teeth.

What makes it even more retarded is that pretty much half of all hyena deaths are related to lion attacks eventhough the lions dont even eat them, they just kill them for fun or to decrease hunting competition. Showing hyenas as sadistic and mindless murderers of lions is like the most ignorant and wrong thing Disney could do.

Lions have no function whatever in nature other than being apex predators. In all territories where they are extinct due to human hunting their disappearence doesnt make any difference for the eco system. Their gap is replaced fast by other competent predators (like the hyena) , lions have absolutely no utility that nature would miss.

For me it  pretty much shows how shallow human cultures and degenerate authors like Hemingway are in depicting animals for their narratives. They always put brute force and aesthetics over utility, thats why most people respect lions while dislike hyenas. Thats a more nazi thing for me than marching in goosestep.

Hyenas have some unique utilities that cannot be replaced by any other animal. They can digest bones, which exposes the calcium and bone mark hidden in the bones of animals. So instead letting bones untouched for millions of years hidden in the earth, the nutrients of bones get back to living organisms. Vultures and other birds feast on hyena shit so they get the calcium required for producing eggs robut enough for an unproblematic time for the baby birds in their eggs.

Hyenas also can eat every biological meat waste, no matter how rotten or infected of diseases it is, without getting sick from it thanks to their abnormal strong stomach acid. They transmit little to no diseases to humans or other animals which is also very rare for the complex mammal that they are. They literally prevent diseases instead of spreading them.

They also require extremly little watter compared to their size and weight, so they really dont drink away the scarce water from other animals and plants in the Savannah.

I am not a biologist but from the facts that I know from real biologists and hyena researchers I think everyone should love them and they deserve to be a symbol of social, intelligent and indispensable useful animals."
Ugw4HCcdfwxQ2VnFGdd4AaABAg,Fabio Franco,1522801664895,"Transcription starting at around 22:07

""We know that if you take yourself and you put yourself in a new environment, new genes turn on in your nervous system. They encode for new proteins. And so, you're full of biological potential that won't be realized unless you move yourself around in the world into different challenging circumstances, and that will turn on different circuits.

So, it's not merely that you're incorporating information from the outside world, in the constructivist sense; it's that by exposing yourself to different environments, you put different physiological demands on your ""self"" all the way down to the genetic level and that manifests new elements of you.

And so one of the things that happens to people -- and this is a very common cultural notion -- is that you should go on a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere central and that would say, like, the rock, Pride Rock in the Lion King.""

The fact that new experiences actually change your very genetic makeup deserves more than the mere cursory treatment that Dr. Peterson offers in this lecture. Does he talk about this subject in any of his other lectures? Which ones? If not, Dr. Peterson, would it be possible to hear more on this subject?

Liberals want change, conservatives are fine with the way how things are. Capitalism creates winners and losers. Losers want to be winners and winners want to stay winners. The basic motivation for change is social status. Most liberals have a low standing in society (aka poor) while liberals with a high status in society have usually been educated by liberal professors (aka theoreticians) at universities. Most conservatives come from the middle class. They are not driven by ambition to change their situation. They believe that society is the result of an evolutionary process and there is simply too much risk in changing what worked in the past. The thing about Trump is that he managed to activate voters who are currently losing and want the ""good old days"" back.

The issue about borders is based on a misunderstanding about the function of borders. States need controlled borders where the default is ""no trespassing"", like the door of your house needs a lock and like computers need a firewall. If you switch off the firewall of your computer you will find out why it was a mistake very soon. If you leave the door open, you may meet very friendly people, but usually you don't. Even if you meet mostly friendly people, one bad person is enough to kill you. That's why we lock our doors and it has nothing to do with psychology. It's just plain evolution. The guys who left their doors open, just got killed by intruders and didn't make it to our gene-pool. It's not liberal or something to leave doors open, it's plain stupid and it will lead to the same outcome.

Psychology can explain a lot about the human thought process, but every once in a while that thought process is simply flawed. We shouldn't accept these mistakes as a wonderful part of human personality. We should simply avoid them."

The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner ""desperateness"" of higher men, this eternal ""too late!"" in every sense—may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his ""going to ruin"" himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness—from what his ""business""—has laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honor, admire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived—or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt great sympathy, together with great contempt, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence—reverence for ""great men"" and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honors the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them .... And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the ""God"" was only a poor sacrificial animal! Success has always been the greatest liar—and the ""work"" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the ""work"" of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is reputed to have created it; the ""great men,"" as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars—the people then call them idealists—often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour ""faith as it is"" out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:—what a torment these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers—that they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do everything—that's a belief particular to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he finds that it rather destroys than saves!— It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that demanded love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send there those who did not want to love him—and that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is all love, all capacity for love—who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such knowledge about love—seeks death!— But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. —"

I walked outside to my car and looked up at the October harvest moon which looked brilliant  due to the light fog which created a halo around it. After briefly admiring the moon, I got in my car and turned on the radio. Crazily enough, the song ""Black Hole Sun"" by Soungarden started playing. This event was part of a larger chain of synchronicity. Chris Cornell, for those of you who don't know, was the singer of that band and the writer of that song. He unfortunately ended his own life back in the spring. Since I heard him perform the theme for Casino Royale, he has my biggest idol for the last ten years as a musician. His last album (Higher Truth) helped me immensely in the final days of my battle with alcohol before I finally achieved sobriety. I admired Chris for not only his music, but also for how humble he was as a person. I obsessively learned his music on guitar and watch many interviews to try to know him as a person.  He also fought addiction. Unfortunately the demons he was self-medicating got the best of him. His death came a week after I had successfully finished my internship at a mental health partial hospitalization program for teenagers with behavioral issues. That internship experience cemented my drive and commitment to be a social worker in the mental health field. Chris's death was a result of mental illness. The news of his passing hit me not only on the level of my professional aspirations, but also in regard to my passion for his music and the fact that it was a factor in my recovery. So with all of that said, that synchronous moment of seeing the cosmic beauty of the moon aligning with sonic beauty of his song was enough to make me burst into tears. Place that moment into the context of the narrative I just described and you can understand a hint of the sheer wonder. Thank you Dr. Peterson for sharing your teachings. I have been watching your lectures as part of what could be called my extended informal education since I graduated this summer.

Ugwa-gdYiUl6U4XJyA14AaABAg,Fred Carrillo,1504484958472,"Like the Lion King, the majority of Disney animated classics used to be about heroic adventure and rebirth. But more recently, their messaging is far more chaotic and sometimes dangerous. Before I discovered Dr. Peterson, I felt a tinge of discomfort when I heard the lyrics to Frozened's ""Let it go"" sung by Elsa, especially the words, ""Let the storm rage on! The cold never bothered me anyway."" They just seemed so dangerous to me at the time though I didn't specifically know why. Now, with a little bit of knowledge shown to me by Dr Peterson, it's obvious how that song gave permission for lack of responsibility, unbridled rage, self destruction, and nihilism. Now of course, people will say that Love eventually triumphed in the end, though in a confusing none archetypal way, and that ""Love saves all"" was the lesson. However, considering how memorable Disney songs tend to be, I suspect most will remember Elsa's happy call to rage and nihilism first and remember ""Love saves all"" a distant second. Also no character in Frozened went through any sort of heroic rebirth journey (heck, even the harsh climb up the peak was parodied by some conveniently found stairs). Worst of all Elsa's rage was never really addressed. I believe the writers thought that Elsa accepting herself and learning to control her powers because of the love she felt for her sister could count as a rebirth. But that rebirth seemed unearned because of the lack of the heroic journey. There was no burning off of the wrong self to achieve the new self, in fact, Elsa reveled in her rage and freedom from responsibility and was presented the most beautifully on her descent into chaos. In fact, she never really ascended out of it. Instead of a heroic rebirth, she had a narcissistic nihilistic, ""perfect the way you are"" one. Thus, on the whole, the real message was less ""Love saves all"" or even ""Let it go"" to more like ""You're perfect the way you are, you don't need to take on responsibility, and God help those that piss you off."""

He literally can't survive without them). It's only when he sees the face of his killers that he starts to realize who he is/was. He goes back to the ghost of his home and gets more clues. He decides to peruse his killers. Finds out who the evil king is (Dick Jones) and goes into the belly of the beast (OCP). He even fights the Dragon (ED209).

One is; the state deteriorates of its own accord, and that’s an entropy observation. What that means is that the state is a construction of the past, right? But the present isn’t the same as the past, and to the degree that the past is mismatched with the demands of the present than it’s tyrannical, it’s malfunctioning.

UgjORqy4HW2QW3gCoAEC,Richard Noll,1504485020956,"(This is a response to a comment on M Czerna's website which hosts a 2014 lecture on Jung)

Dear Vegan GCB:

""Podcasting it out"" with Jordan would be fun. Serious discussions of Jung's work between people with different perspectives are rare.  When I told my students in my ""Psychology of Spiritual Experience"" course about Jordan's comments about me and my work, they too urged me to ""podcast it out"" with him. A few days later one of my students presented me with some buttons to wear if such an event takes place. They each have one word on them that Jordan has used in various videos or in written comments in replies to questions put to him about my work: CROOKED, UNSCRUPULOUS, JEALOUS, RESENTFUL.  I think we can all just have a good laugh about this.

But Jordan needs to explain why it is so difficult for him to examine Jung's ideas of archetypes and the collective unconscious in the same critical manner in which he conducts his scientific work on personality traits. He does not do so for his students in his lectures, nor did he do so in his video reply to Sam Harris. Jung made public claims about these concepts and then presented evidence in favor of them, but as I tried to show in my work his evidence was tainted (indeed, at times consciously falsified) and he never convincingly ruled out the two strongest alternate explanations for these concepts:  the cultural transmission of symbols and myths (of which there is abundant evidence) and cryptomnesia (a phenomenon Jung wrote about), which would be a more reasonable explanation for the appearance of symbols and myths and Greek gods in patients' dreams and in psychotic delusions and hallucinations. In cognitive psychology today this is sometimes called ""source amnesia"": and idea pops into our heads or our dreams and we experience it as novel and surprising, but in fact we had been exposed to it earlier and had ""forgotten"" that we had done so. Unconscious plagiarism (like George Harrison's case with ""My Sweet Lord"") is an example of this."

The I Ching, the version whose translation was approved by C. G. Jung, the Wilhelm/ Baynes edition can also give an overall impression and also a specific answer. (See pages 725 and 730 for help.)  Dr. John Beebe M.D. of the San Francisco Jungian Institute gave a lecture at the institute on how to use the I-Ching, (that specific edition which he recommended, and which he learned how to use growing up in China), and a movie buff, he gave a program of Jungian interpretations of movies,  both of which I attended decades ago when I lived in San Francisco. He is an analyst, a writer, is on the faculty, a lecturer, a past president of the C. G. Jung Institute of San Francisco. ( See Youtube.) (See Wiki.)  Perhaps Dr. Jordan B.

UgjPYqhL9gd5o3gCoAEC,Richard Noll,1504485046842,"Jordan's pairing of Jung with the Lion King has deeper (perhaps ""archetypal"" in Jordan's preferred vocabulary) resonances than he may realize.

On Christmas Day 1913, while deliberately engaging in mental imagery/inner sense cultivation experiments in his home library, Jung had a visionary experience in which he interpreted (in a private 1925 seminar) as both a ""deification"" and an ""initiation"" into ancient mysteries, specifically the Mithraic mysteries. In this experience he assumed the position of the crucified Christ, sweat blood, and at the moment of climax he head turned into that of a lion.  He became a lion-headed deity (like Aion). This episode is in the ""Mysterium"" section of The Red Book.

For those interested in an analysis and commentary on this life-changing experience in Jung's life, my 1992 article ""Jung the Leontocephalus"" can be found online here: 
https://www.academia.edu/15115530/Jung_the_Leontocephalus_1992_in_Paul_Bishop_ed._Jung_in_Contexts_1999_

As The Red Book indicates, Jung had more than one deification experiences. Another involved being hung upside down from a tree like Wotan in Norse mythology.  I mention this, and other anomalous experiences of Jung, in my short vignette case history at the beginning of my chapter on ""Psychosis"" in Greg Eghigian's forthcoming edited volume, The Routledge History of Madness and Mental Health. The manuscript is available online here:  https://www.academia.edu/13557839/Psychosis._In_Greg_Eghigian_ed._The_Routledge_History_of_Madness_and_Mental_Health._London_Routledge_forthcoming_April_2017_pages_331-349

For those who do not want to sign onto Academia.edu to gain access to these papers, I can send them to you directly via email if you contact me at richard.noll@desales.edu

For a fascinating survey of these sorts of experiences, I heartily recommend classicist M. David Litwa's 2013 book, Becoming Divine: And Introduction to Deification in Western Culture. Jung is not in it, but there is a vivid chapter on the magical procedures for the deification of the magician in the ""Mithraic Liturgy"" -- an ancient magical text that fascinated Jung and formed part of the evidence that convinced him of the reality of the archetypes and of the existence of a collective unconscious.

I have posted more detailed comments to the video of Jordan's lecture on Jung, which I hope helps elucidate the perspectival differences in our approaches to the life and work of Jung. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r8ISkQ4exM"

I resonated soundly with your comments concerning Satan and Lucifer as a representations of hyper-rationality of maybe just cogitation in general. Isn't it interesting that it seems it is the one quality within us that can make us begin to feel that we are something 'other' than nature--such a ""Satanic' rebellion, is it not? Being as it is that religion, in large part, is really a struggle to explain the presence of 'evil' in the world, I've always wondered intensely about these two characters; are they the same? Different? 

I wonder if they might represent, quite appropriately, two different poles of 'evil' viewed as a whole which if allowed to dominate, are particularly insidious. Lucifer has that fiery quality about him, being a shining light, the morning star, particularly beautiful. This is akin to arrogance, hubris, and the like in relationship to thinking that is more closely associated with an emotional link. Emotional thought, per se, that in its tyranny and impulsiveness may lead one to 'see red' with fiery hell-fire violence. Satan on the other hand seems to be a pole associated with infinite caution as opposed to impulsivity. I notice how when we think of any particularly terrifying character, we are 'chilled to the bone' at his 'cold calculations'. It is in fact rationality divorced from the warmth of Lucifer. 

It seems to me that Satan and Lucifer, in all their mythology, exist in some (as you might say, Jordan) hyper reality within each and every one of us. These are elements which as far as I understand we cannot escape. We are verily forced to confront the faculties of thought and emotion, and strike some harmonious balance between unchecked impulsivity and passion and infinite caution and calculation. Then out of 'evil' per se, something good, some harmonious construction is formed. It makes me wonder about the 'rejection' of evil, and wonder if it is simply not just necessary. A difficult conclusion, but logical nonetheless."

Ugiv-e1eYEH0Q3gCoAEC,Kon Berner,1504485067282,"""The state is a hierarchy with something at the top that occupies a space that has been illuminated and made safe by consciousness."" So, for example, the states in 1937 USSR, 1858 India, 1945 Germany, 1780 Argentina, 1966 China, and 1937 Japan, would be examples of this. Right? Perhaps better to say that this is what the state could be, but never has been. Or at least to the extent it has been done, it has also been polluted with injustice and domination e.g. the Egyptian pyramids were built by slaves, correct? Might have been sophisticated and well treated slaves in many cases, but slaves nonetheless. 

EDIT: You started covering my point above around 31:00 .... Point: 1) living constitution needed sort of point... not convincing. Point 2: Misallocation of resources due to laziness caused by statist monopoly where it goes beyond applying ""consciousness"" and tries central planning (which can't work)... agreed. This is why the dominance hierarchy has to be constantly questioned by humans, especially keeping it as limited as possible (to the useful rule of law function).

I've always thought about this danger of diagnosing someone with a mental illness and telling them that's what they have. I think in a lot of ways mental health problems are infectious and even awareness of them can get people second guessing whether they are actually sane or not. Because in reality everyone probabaly has some kind of mental deficiency, it's part of what makes us human and imperfect. So labelling can be very detrimental in this sense. Which is why I think this push for everyone to discuss mental health more needs to be looked at with a bit of caution. We are not designed to have everyone's mental issues weighing on our conscious as well as our own. I think a better solution would be to work on giving everyone the tools to sort of win their own mental battles in their heads.

UghZ8QJ--FEaF3gCoAEC,Amit Sen,1472948517456,"I have a thought regarding the unconditional positive regard you are mentioning, that Rogers is talking about. I had quite a crisis in the mid 90ies, that I with some help from friends got through alive. Well, I don't think I would have died, but I probably would have been emotionally (and hence mentally, I believe those two go together in a much more intimate way than we generally think) impaired. This was when I was in the middle of my training to become a gestalt therapist. After the second year in my training (of a four year educations) I got some feedback that meant that I couldn't complete my training. I would have to re-take the year I had just gone through, which basically meant being in a group process with a new group for another year, while my class mates went on to the next year. I didn't fully understand my reaction at the time, but I learnt later on that a big portion of the physical pain, anxiety and general weariness was, shame. I think of shame as the affect that regulates social contact. In daily terms one would say shyness, but I've stuck with shame as the general term. I also relate this to Ericson's (E.H.) idea of basic trust and basic misstrust, where shame is an endemic misstrust of sorts. My experience after having worked for 18 years or so, is that when you go deep enough, you come to a place where people are concerned with how they will be perceived, on such a deep level that they will not risk taking that last step unless the situation is really safe. When appropriate (when my client is fully aware that the framework is a professional one) I can take the risk saying ""I will never judge you"" (I have to mean that of course, which implies acknowledging some dark places of my own of corse) and ”I will never leave you”. There is potentially a problem here, at least I thought there might be, that I will evoke ”false hope”. So far I’ve only seen positive outcomes of this. Partly I guess this has to do with me sensing if it’s appropriate for me to say something like this. But it’s not to difficult to dress this message up in a way so that it can be received without putting myself and the client in this situation. One way to ”step this down” a notch, is to play the ”what-if game” (”what if I/somebody told you …”). Well, my point here is that this is how I understand Rogers emphasis in the unconditional positive regard. (This, accidentally, leads to to the radical insight, that there can’t be evil in the world, which of course presupposes seeing even more of your own darkness and, well, Hanlons razor. :)   )

UgiXkMbI7sh3R3gCoAEC,Rince wind,1472948517514,"I had this idea. If we take into account the evolutionary perspective, there are parts of us that still operates in the same ways as it does in an animal. That`s why learning & behaviour psychology is so usefull, it outlines these somewhat robotic parts of the human brain with great accuracy. It`s interesting to note what Rogers and the humanists say about becoming a whole human being. That would mean making the old, lower parts of the brain work with more developed higher parts of the brain. So for example; if one has irrational anxiety, one could categorize that as a function of the older parts of the brain - the non-verbal parts. Survival mechanisms  that reacts on stimuli in the enviroment, and stimuli created by the higher functions of the brain (the imaginitative capacities). 

The developed parts of our brain that deal with abstract thinking interpolates narratives of meaning on top of the non-verbal phenomena created by the lower parts. And here I think much of the problems of modern man lies. Does your verbal constructs work with, or against your non-verbal bodily, or survival functions. When there is a negative feeling in the body - does it invoke all of the higher abstract thinking capabilites? or is it detached. Does it serve any usefull function to create a whole intellectualized, abstract concept based on a feeling? I think not, it is to misuse the imaginative capabilites. What might be better is to deconstruct all abstractions so that one gets to a place of stillness where emotion can be observed directly, without invoking the higher mental abbilities. Cause I don`t believe that the survival mechanisms listen to reason, they are non-verbal after all. I believe this is the real state mindfullnes, being in the body, not trying to avoid it by trying to think a way out of it.

I`ve seen people who been very nervous before a public speech, but it did not bother them or diminish their presentation in any way. They were fine with being nervous, and said they were so out loud. This shows acceptance of the nervousness.  And that`s a great way to deal with the older parts of the brain. If one does not accept, it invokes the higher abilities - trying to find a way to escape the here & now, one part of oneself tries to escape the other, and thats pathological."
UggEbBzHcRAnM3gCoAEC,Andrius Bendikas,1472948517534,"A question that has popped in my mind is how you deal with the person who is overly sensitive and at the same time, likes to complain? For example, the tendency to complain about the situations in which he or she could have been solving the problem actively but instead, just watched the situation happen. 

One option is to let it go (is it a good one if that's the person you care about)?

Another option is telling them that maybe they should have done this or that to make situation better (but then they will get overly upset and take it as an attack on them even though from the first view, they weren't the bad guys which might put a relationship on risk)?

Third option could be asking a question ""Is there anything you could have done to improve this situation over long-term?"" Which as I was typing, seemed like the best option for me, subjectively. However, there is a huge fight between those 3."

Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. Proverbs 16:4 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. And God promises to completely remove evil.  Nahum 1:9  What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.  Revelation 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  Evil is temporarily necessary for us to have the free will necessary to create our own soul, personality, character. Evil and Hell are simply the absence of God. God = fiery, love, light, good, truth, life Deuteronomy 4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire... hell = fiery, hate, dark, evil, lies, death. 1 Corinthians 3:13 Every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire (God); and the fire shall try every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) of what sort it is. 1 Corinthians 3:14  If any man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 1 Corinthians 3:15  If any man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character) shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself (spirit, mind, consciousness) shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 1 Peter 1:17  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's (spirit, mind, consciousness) work (soul, personality, character), pass the time of your sojourning (temporary residence) here in fear: Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men (spirit, mind, consciousness) once to die (separate from God like Adam), but after this the judgment:(the Krisis of rejoining God) Revelation 20:14  And death (separation from God) and hell (negative God) were cast into the lake of fire (God). This is the second death. (separation from an evil soul, personality, character).  Revelation 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire (God) and brimstone: which is the second death.(separation from an evil soul, personality, character)  Revelation 21:4  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death (separation from God), neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. But Matthew 16:26 For what is a man (spirit, mind, consciousness) profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul (soul, personality, character)? or what shall a man (spirit, mind, consciousness) give in exchange for his soul (soul, personality, character)?

God is a being of freedom, and order is the tool for pulling him up from the earth like a well-spun vase.

It was a literary movement manufactured by tortured artists who had an audience among themselves in the 50s & 60s and complained about nausea, angst, boredom, etc. so that they claim what sensitive souls they were to bear the harsh absurdity of existence now that one of their own academic sherpa/guru had said, ""God is dead.""  The general public never really caught on to all the hype about God's demise.  It was a intellectual fad that had come and is now gone.

Religion is still in full force, despite the fears of secularization.  The 60s, of which you read Walter Kaufman, was freaked out about the decline in religion, especially Christianity.  There was the death of God religious movement in Protestantism, the atheism of Communism, the rise of secularism with the sciences, etc.  However, the death of God is overly exaggerated."

I have thought about the nature of pain a bit but I doubt that thought is worth much consideration. Even so, I wrote a few lines on what I think pain is or at least what some part of it is. Here goes:

Pain is that thing which distances oneself from all that is good and enjoyable. It precludes all good. No food tastes sweet; no music moves; no caress excites. It is a form of death.

I know from my own experience of severe pain that nothing that I normally would enjoy or crave or phantasize about is worth a damn. 

Ok, so now I have thrown this out. Probably not the smartest thing I have done today but it’s not like I have worse things to do and it might spur a conversation. If not I’ll risk the projectiles flung toward me."

A.K.: According to encyclopedias, Kierkegaard is supposed to have been the first ""existentialist"" philosopher. But what does that even mean? When was there ever a philosopher who didn't concern himself with existence? That's all that philosophers are concerned with! because they are concerned with everything, and there IS nothing else apart from existence! Do these people who create these utterly retarded labels ever read anything? All the issues with which K-man was concerned have been mulled over by philosophers for millennia, and if you look closely enough you'll not find a single idea in him that had not already been explored to one degree or another by numerous previous thinkers (and in plenty of cases to a much greater depth than him). There is no ""existentialism"", there are only a bunch of mouthbreathing subhumans who are too stupid to deal with the actual issues at hand, and who therefore prefer to make neat little bunches of them by blanketing them with retarded makeshift labels, and then proceed to juggle those instead so that they won't ever have to think about anything. Even ""postmodernism"" is a more valid label than existentialism, and that's saying something!"

While adressing the problems of the 'here and now' may seem more important than adressing the problems of 'the afterlife', consider the following:

1) If you actively start working on a better afterlife, and not passively wait around for it, you'll probably get there faster than if you constantly try to solve your short-term problems. There will always be more problems in the short term, that's what the legend of Sisyphus tells. 

Those who chase around their momentary problems (the fix, the game) end up costing time and energy of those who are working on the better future. This results in a negative attitude, with fatalism and shifting the blame in the mix. Because, when you find out that you can't solve every problem on your own, you might tend to blame others, instead of yourself. Resulting in violence, in words or in deeds. Slight nod to WWII here.

The Christian faith combats this by telling people not to WAIT for heaven, it tells people to actively WORK TOGETHER on making the place that they inhibit more Paradise-like. Working together requires coördination, compassion and some sacrifice, resulting in peace.


2.) Don't forget that Nietschze was probably a very unhappy person most of his life. He did a lot of drugs, was never married, and suffered a mental breakdown at 44. His life story seems to not have been a stable, and it's important to take this into consideration when you contextualize his work."

This is partly, I suppose, due to the meddling of his appallingly malicious and antisemitic sister and brother-in-law's handling of his estate (to whom, in life, Nietzsche wrote many a strongly worded letter of condemnation). 

It's also partly due to the fact that his points go over the vast majority of people's heads - particularly the edgy teenagers who purport to be his devout followers.

One of the worst misunderstandings is that he's seen as the father of Nihilism (when, in fact, he was warning against its impending advent). The other colossal misunderstandings - which is perhaps much more damaging - is the concept of the Übermensch. Most people take it to mean that the strong, ruthless, and amoral are superior and have free reign to tyrannize everyone else - the Üntermenschen. In reality, he saw traditional morals and values rapidly decaying with the belief systems that held them in place, and that one must craft their values for themselves. One of those he thought up for himself was the (metaphorical) notion that time is circular, and that he should live his life as if he would have to relive it in the same way endlessly - so he should avoid actions that would result in suffering or regret.

I was always interested in art and philosophy, and the fallenness of the society as a construct and the  predicament of living and desperately trying to thrive in its consumptionism stricken reality. I suppliment my search with videos of Eric Dodson and reading Anthony De mello's Awakening, and  all of this combined teaches me to first observe and dissect everything i come in contact with, including myself and my reactions, emotions and psychological patterns, and only then form an opinion and an approach to it. . So far i have only come in contact with existentialist philosophy, but i  find it very difficult to believe  that i'll ever find a branch of philosophy more fitting for my life ( and im sure many of us feel like that, given that the universality and relevance of a work/idea system in lives of many people is a telltale sign of it's ingeniousness) I truly would suggest taking a deep, inquisitive  look into the amazing, elaborate scope of views and analysis that Mr.Peterson presents us with in his videos.

She chose a path, and went down it like a thunderbolt. Yet Joan, when I came to think of her, had in her all that was true either in Tolstoy or Nietzsche, all that was even tolerable in either of them. I thought of all that is noble in Tolstoy, the pleasure in plain things, especially in plain pity, the actualities of the earth, the reverence for the poor, the dignity of the bowed back. Joan of Arc had all that and with this great addition, that she endured poverty as well as admiring it; whereas Tolstoy is only a typical aristocrat trying to find out its secret. And then I thought of all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor Nietzsche, and his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time. I thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger, his hunger for the rush of great horses, his cry to arms. Well, Joan of Arc had all that, and again with this difference, that she did not praise fighting, but fought. We KNOW that she was not afraid of an army, while Nietzsche, for all we know, was afraid of a cow. Tolstoy only praised the peasant; she was the peasant. Nietzsche only praised the warrior; she was the warrior. She beat them both at their own antagonistic ideals; she was more gentle than the one, more violent than the other. Yet she was a perfectly practical person who did something, while they are wild speculators who do nothing. It was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she and her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility that has been lost. And with that thought came a larger one, and the colossal figure of her Master had also crossed the theatre of my thoughts"" ~ Chesterton"

If we're searching for the smoking gun, all we have to do is look at Descartes - it was his philosophy of doubt that caused us to search relentlessly for something that wasn't there.

We're talking about a game where you can change into the clothes of anyone you kill, by killing a person, you are literally and directly rewarded with a new costume. It encourages you to kill police, it encourages you to kill chefs, it encourages you to kill literally every person in the entire game, it gives you a war arsenal of impossibly powered weapons, which according to you I'm just not supposed to use, as you stealth your way around killing nobody but your target with fuckin poison in his food or something. You completely missed the point of the game, do you know what the game encourages you to do? It encourages one single perfect playthrough where you kill only your target, to maximize your unlocks, then it encourages you to replay the level and murder everything that moves with an SG552. Constantly changing between the costumes of the different people you've been killing to keep the heat off.

The brutality of history is irrational, and somehow that means we can't use rationality ourselves to understand it? It doesn't make sense; it's like it gets confused about what even the definition of the word ""irrational"" is.

And then there's one about, you can't use rationality for everything because there's too much complexity, so you need to use emotions and other decision-making strategies. Well yes, of course that's true in practice, but that's supposed to be a criticism of rationality itself? There is no tenant of rationality that states or implies that one must try to solve every challenge by cold logical deduction.

Reminds me of the common, totally misconceived criticism of economists, that they think people should only care about money. It's a totally silly and confused idea, like if you tried to criticize plumbers ""because they think everything should be solved with pipes"". Just some sort of fallacy where people assume there's an ideology where there actually isn't one, I guess. I think that's the same thing that's happening here with rationality.

We crave it and the fact that we do frightens us to the very bone. When I lose meaning in life I find my self, consciously or subconsciously, desiring hardship. I never could make sense of it until recent. Suffering gives life meaning.

Science provides hope as well for man's misery, contributes to a great standard of living and allows him to live longer than any other time in history.  You are creating a religion in some respects woven together from many different sources, perhaps just like the different tribal stories have contributed to the totality of the old testament narrative.  You are spinning a comprehensive yarn drawn from many sources.  You are a prophet who has seen God's miracles and cures, though you can point to no God.

Thsi professor doesn't seem to master what he's talking about. Here are two examples.
It is essentially wrong to reduce existential anxiety to something similar to the experience of a rat put in a new cage or a child left alone. In both these situations it is an instinctual fear in which one 'loses oneself', that is where one has a very low level of self-consciousness. Existential anxiety on the other hand stems from an acute awarneess of self as being here, and is not accessible to an animal. 
The idividualism shared by the existentialists has nothing to do with the methodology in the social and human sciences of the same name. It expresses a moral concern, the importance of developing a self-counsciousnes and an inwardness, freeing onself from the group so as to live an authentic life.

It explains the dissonance that SJW's have with public spouting and virtue signalling for victim causes without actually getting involved one-on-one with people in need, like feeding the poor, visiting the lonely,  doing physical service projects. They just don't like to get their hands dirty doing the actual grunt work.

Whereas conservatives, in my experience, just quietly help people without making a big deal about it, without demanding public recognition and applause. Mother Teresa is a case in point. She was just focused on dealing with the one person who needed help that was in front of her, whereas many organizations and celebs criticize her for not spending more time being a public activist to raise money and get the world involved--which again, is easy to do than actually helping the poor, sick, and homeless on a personal level."

UgibLs_gKofCaXgCoAEC,Martin Land,1504485031908,"absolutely brilliant. I am very haltingly and ineptly reworking myself in the light of professor Peterson's insight. as a student  I wished I could converse with the ghosts of Neitzsche Kropotkin and  Darwin ( and Hegel. I would love to see Peterson  lecture on him but probably way off topic) . in being able to recieve the professor's lecture I feel my wish has been exceeded. ( would also be interested in Peterson's thoughts on Kropotkin. As a very old school anarchist what still attracts me to the school of thought is the insistence on individual responsibility as method and goal . on individual empowerment likewise. it is a doctrine in many ways more utopian than the 57 flavours of Marxism. but intellectually if not organisationally I find the refusal to install blueprints for utopia and the insistence that this can only be achieved by the combined self activity of all the people to be more honest and powerful. socialism not as state ownership plus electrification but as the ability of all to work as they choose without impediment beyond the consequences of their personal error or incompetence or that of the collective to which they have freely affiliated. I am not optimistic for this in this day ( Though must study the experiments in libertarian municipalism,embattled but ongoing in Rojava etc. )and so feel classical liberalism to be the least of evils in most cases( by which I mean classical liberalism as embraced by the early British Trade Unions where political liberalism was combined with mutual aid and democratic collective  self organisation , before they marched down the blind alley of the oh so well intentioned labour party. I find we are back in the place of Aristophanes' ' the Birds' where democracy with all its utopianism and failings remains a precious jewell amidst all kinds of repressive totalitarian onslaught. yet is lost between on the one hand a petty self serving  nihilism and on the other a dogmatic resentful hypocritical moralism. )
I suppose the anarcho- democratic myth is the last survivor which might Allow an honest approach to organising life so that the individual may struggle to become whatever he wants to be with the best chance of the intelligence allowing this to be available and the impediments against this being minimal. But then what do I know. my moral compass was formed by NTV's 'Monkey' and 'The water margin'  with a little Pilgrims progress and a bit of Rev John Ball  and some romance of the 3 kingdoms on the side. with bits of Homer Plutarch and Thucydides informing . ( ok Aristophanes Aristotle and McCabe in their as well. Dunayevskaya a bit. Makhno and Flores-magon a bit)"

For canines, as far as we can tell, their sense of smell (which, neurologically speaking, is orders of magnitude more sensitive than humans, literally dogs have way more olfactory neurons than humans do, and humans have way more optical neurons than canines) is a way of taking in the world and in a sense seeing, so for dogs smelling is like vision. So it doesn't follow that just because someone has 20/20 vision they would never want to go outside because the sun is shinning and there are a lot of things to look at. Quite the opposite: the more data input, the more knowledgeable an entity is about their environment, thus the more potentially secure ."

UgglQAbb1_TWe3gCoAEC,Digital Dakini,1504485036835,"Shantideva said, ""Moreover, suffering has good qualities"". And as you know the first Noble Truth is ""All existence is suffering"". Since suffering is pervasive, changing and manifest it goes without saying that we are surrounded with an infinite source of that which those of us who know at the core of us is inevitable, and therefore if voluntarily accepted can achieve the ""goal"". As. a Buddhist we call that enlightenment, but we do tend towards over simplicity of mere labels. Enlightenment in its broad sense it to become awakened, and I would hazard a guess that all philosophies have that same goal. It is through understanding the nature of suffering, the nature of experiencing that suffering that we can voluntarily accept that suffering. An anecdote: when I experienced the pains of labour I voluntarily endured that physical pain knowing that at the end of it I would have a new life, but in accepting that pain I gained much more than that. I discovered in that pain I had the ability to focus my mind, without distraction, on that experience, being a meditator that was fascinating, useful beyond measure and awakening. I experienced an understanding that this pain could be the cause of my death, and in accepting that gained a small insight into that which most of us are so terrified we never dare to venture into thinking about. Our own mortality. We are gong to die. Definitely. Permanently! And in that knowledge of what others might view as great suffering an invaluable gift was given to me. Poverty, endured voluntarily brought a degree of contentment. Loneliness, voluntarily accepted brought introspection, deep levels of thought and understanding. Pain and suffering are inevitable and most of us push this unique currency away because of its discomfort, not knowing they push away that which they wish for, the goal. The awakening. Enlightenment."

Kierkegaard was also important, because I had a genocidal hatred of Christianity and thinking of men like Kierkegaard and Martin Luther King helped make it possible for me to not totally fall off the cliff and explode. I was a sick, sick nihilist back in the day. And I've just always been obsessed with the movement these three men created.

So possibly what apple really tries to sell is a sliver of utopia with its products.
""Buy this product and all your worries and anxieties will disappear!""

Also the promise of immortality by the singularity by people in silicon valley is a almost a grotesk rejection and denial of what is to be human.

Now I see how not accepting vulnerability can lead to catastrophic outcomes in a multiplicity of ways. And no amount of technological, economical or political safety can eradicate or suspense with vulnerability. But maybe we should have enough safety to retreat to when the chaos of the unknown (or chaos as such) becomes too much too bear.

This doppelganger paraded itself around in costumes bedding kings, bedding commerce, bedding military forces, and extending it's power by proxy.  This monster died and needed to die.  Science never replaced religion because science does not posses the hardware for meaning.  It's not just truth that Christianity exalts.  It is truth and meaning.  There are things that are true that does not move the needle.  Get behind a podium and recite traffic statistics.  No one will care.   Christianity makes the case that God is true and MEANINGFUL!  Buddhists believe in gods or devas, but don't place great importance on them, so that is not the central feature in their religion.  It's there but not coveted.

   I have been doing a lot of research and development into the meaning of life and I have come to an ultimatum. Suicide is the “rational” response to life. Even great minds like Solomon, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy arrived at this conclusion. Homo sapiens sapiens, on our small planet, in a small galaxy, in a seemingly infinite universe, don't matter. An individual human life, averaging 80 years means nothing in a universe that will last 100’s of billions of years. And let’s not even get into parallel universes, higher dimensions and determinism. Not to mention the fact that, life is suffering. In his book Confession, Tolstoy says

“So that besides rational knowledge, which had seemed to me the only knowledge, I was inevitably brought to acknowledge that all live humanity has another irrational knowledge — faith which makes it possible to live. Faith still remained to me as irrational as it was before, but I could not but admit that it alone gives mankind a reply to the questions of life, and that consequently it makes life possible. “

   It has been many years and I am still stuck in a state of ennui and apathy. How can one hypocritically embrace irrationality and faith when it is rationality in the first place that brought me here? How can a conscious man be anything more than a man like the one Dostoyevsky described in Notes from Underground?

Now before we start let me explain my dream neighborhoods. Whenever I am outside in a dream and can see the surrounding structures it's always a blur of houses or buildings I have seen or been too. I understand that, the dream is filling in the blanks with familiar buildings. The buildings should be along this sidewalk otherwise the world is broken, let's just check the files on buildings and copy/paste. Originally it was houses and the like but more recently businesses and video game/media buildings, so things from movies and such.

Basically any place I actually document as special I could dream of in this neighborhood. Well in this dream it was a collection of houses, my mothers work, and my church (Which is across the street from my mothers business) This neighborhood actual consisted mostly actual houses from the block around my mothers business, just one or two were different.

I don't remember half the dream, only the part that terrified me and the parts before that. For some reason a tiger was sleeping on a swing in front of one of the houses that actually exists next to my mothers work. I did everything I could to sneak past that big bengal tiger. I reached a house that didn't belong there and tried to enter thinking it the house of my mothers current secretary. Surely she would help me. Problem is the concrete porch was missing up close to the door and I fell making a loud noise and waking the tiger.

I turned and ran a distance before it caught me, tackled me, and bit into my stomach. The whole thing woke me up screaming because my blanket bunched around my stomach making it feel like something was actually biting down on my stomach. I threw my blanket off and went running.

This dream disturbs me to this day and I don't know why."

UggG5XPD8FHbQHgCoAEC,Julian,1504484541296,"This teacher says that Dasein is the ""totality of experiencing"" in which everyone is ""encapsulated"". This statement makes no sense to me.

""Dasein versteht sich in irgendeiner Weise in seinem Sein"" - Dasein comprehends itself in some manner in its being and makes it amenable in the sense of ""I am"". On top of that reasoning may or may not appear (animal rationale / zoon logon echon). That is a very central element in his philosophy and it doesn't seem adequately grasped in this strange lecture that claims to be about phenomenology while consisting of one hour of anecdotal insights and twenty minutes of phenomenology. And some of his statements are downright outrageous. Marx certainly never argued that the people who gained a status of elite in a system created the system. That's paradoxical. And the proposition of this teacher that music business being dominated by few musicians and one percent of the world population owning more than half of the worlds wealth would be basically the same and sort of an inevitable natural development makes me utterly speechless.

You discuss his idea of value-creating, but we shouldn't forget that he said quite clearly that the value-creating was a function of very rare ""higher men"".  He also said that lesser men [which comprise the vast majority of us] didn't just NEED to be dominated by man with the strength and will to dominate, but that they WANTED to be.  With that axiom in place, it isn't stretch at all for the rationalization and application of the dark deeds that came not long after.  

I think a more effective argument against his idea of value-creating [if you agree that such a thing is possible in the first place] is that most people aren't able or willing to do it - a view that is congruent with his actual work and a more practical real-world counterpoint.  I think that - even if one can't create truly new values - that Nietzsche's 'higher men' are capable of adopting a set of values that sometimes will discard parts of the social contract.  This can be valuable and positive for an actualized person, but can also be an effective tool and downright dangerous in the hands of extremists.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Nietzsche is to blame for the rise of totalitarian culture, but pretending that his message was merely warped, or misinterpreted by the 20th century idealouges isn't a fair analysis of the work.  He had a lot dangerous ideas; he said so himself."

Ugw5-FtdxpsY7ww7VA54AaABAg,Walter Peretiatko,1525393642066,"Pain is not fundamental -- we have pain from things that are not there, e.g., pain from a missing leg.  We can ignore our pain as athletes do.  And though we can have physical and psychological pain we can also have physical and psychological pleasure. But the important thing to remember is that many of these people are romantic and prone to the affectation of the ""sickness of artists"" --  misunderstood, too sensitive, complicated, etc. -- which raises their stature in the community.  All this leaning toward the miserable in life -- nausea boredom, angst, etc. --  is mainly an act. These feelings should not be felt by people who have a high status in the community.  And if they are feeling such feeling then there are medications that can relieve them.  But most of it is just the pretense to being ""artistic"" because artists had become priests.  Once God is dead, artist are next in line of importance because of the god-like creativity.  It'[s the ""tortured artist effect"" written large!   

What would there be if there was nothing conscious?  There would be the same things as if there was conscious.  if all the people died on the planet -- no consciousness -- the CNN tower would still be there.

Reason has to be in control or else these other ""personalities,"" these ""anxieties"" take over and become habitual.  So reason has to be in control.  To become one thing, unified is a discipline of the monks.

Most people will try get rid of the pain rather than what causes it.  However, being as you define it is now a psychological entity."

UgzK3Afz9_dJ_wpX9bZ4AaABAg,Alec Losinski,1512347262719,"I like Dr. Peterson, but I find his acceptance of phenomenology disheartening. It seems the easy way out of explaining the universe without describing the underlying mechanisms. 

Eg. Why is a coke can a coke can to us? Well, it is its ""meaning"" or ""Essence."" 
justs seems a cop-out. Instead of explaining the underlying way that our brain ties concepts together to form our consciousness.

Eg. why does water have the properties of water? 
Phenomenological answer: the emergent properties come from water's essence and meaning.
scientific answer: the properties come not only from what water is made of (two hydrogens and one Oxygen) but also of how the molecule is configured such as how the molecules are oriented and how they share their electrons which change the distribution of charge on the molecule. The emergent properties are greater than their parts, yet you don't need some external substance or force to explain where they come from. 

Science does have a way to understand the world and describe our experience. It may not have a good explanation at the moment of how consciousness works, but it seems rather premature to throw science out as a possible method to explain consciousness altogether. There has been a multitude of times where people have thought it impossible to explain phenomena with science and they were later proven wrong. The hard question of consciousness is just that  ""hard"" but what we are likely missing is not the correct method, but a lack of imagination."

You can see how by imagining what happens to parallel lines on the surface of a sphere. The (straight) lines through any point on the sphere are the great circles (i.e. they circumnavigate the sphere). Any other lines are not ""straight"" since they have intrinsic curvature. For example, lines of longitude are straight lines on the earth (ignoring the fact that the earth is not quite a sphere), but lines of latitude are not straight (think about the lines of latitude close to the poles: they're circles around the pole so clearly have curvature). Now, consider two parallel straight lines on the sphere. That's two  great circles. But  great circles always intersect in two antipodean points. So this is how you get non-Euclidean geometry by dropping the axiom that parallel lines must never meet.

Now, you might object that great circles are only parallel in two locations, which is correct. But an equivalent Euclidean axiom to ""parallel lines never meet"" would be ""parallel lines always remain parallel""  (perhaps - don't quote me :) ), so you can consider that the geometry on the surface of the sphere violates either the former or the latter - they're equivalent."

Are they not just sharing their image of themselves, however inaccurate it may be? This question comes up when ever I try to take any personality questionnaire. I quickly notice that the whole test is predicated on the idea that I know myself to a certain degree of depth and accuracy. Do I? I may be convinced that I acted or thought a certain way while looking back retrospectively, but that in no way implies that I actually thought or acted that way.

In the time that I have been recording my questions and attempting to find answers directly or indirectly, I have found a natural inclination to begin taking more care and pride in my personal space; previously It was seen merely as a place of sleep and storage and not much else. The point at which he mentions about organising ones room, made me smile...'The things you do every day, those are the most important things you do.' or, fix the things you do the most. Maybe I'm taking what I want from the section of this lecture and interpreting it a certain way for my own benefit, but it suggested to me that my approach to tackling issues that have up until recently, been unidentifiable, has been yielding some success.

I always thought that Heidegger was a bit of a Cittamatrin, the position is still ultimately flawed from a Madhyamaka point of view, as there is still something put forth as a ""model"" of reality, or what ultimately contitutes the nature of reality, or any given entity... and as soon as you put forth a model of ultimate reality, or the ""highest"" form of wisdom or something like that - your position will have flaws.

Eh, I dunno. I have problem with the notion that the fear of what will happen can motivate a person. That assumes a person is afraid to die, or afraid for their own life. It's just the inverse of the need for success (the need to not fail), and some people can only be motivated by other people, by being needed by others, by helping others. Most jobs today use the motivation of self-advancement and the fear of death or poverty to get people to do whatever they want. In that scenario, to go off on a tangent, we're actually SELECTING for people who only care about themselves, by cutting out those who are motivated by others and by the needs of others.

I think you have to understand that just because a selection process has worked so far doesn't mean we should keep follow it, that we shouldn't use our oversized brains to try to pick better things to select for."
UggaE46Ee1cHXngCoAEC,B. Wooton,1504484899284,"So the concept Jordan likes about Rogers, is the definitional difference between dialogue, discussion and debate.

Awesome distillation of a true problem America (And the other allied powers that benefited from the use of process improvement and strategic planning - which was so powerful that it was deemed a national security secret) has experienced since WWII.  We implemented strategic planning, thought of it as strategic thinking (the difference is outlined by Julia Sloan in her book Learning to think strategically) and forgot how to creatively reflect and grow through the process of dialogue.

 Are those people just different, or are they broken? And I'm not talking about the sort of person that's deranged and wants to go out and rape and eat people for fun. I'm just asking about the person that maybe feels stressed and confined by routines, and ends up making money illegally, though perhaps not by doing something that's morally wrong.
 
 And in an earlier lecture you kept using the word ""loser"" when referring to people that wouldn't be desirable mates; so is the implication that there's only one good way of looking at this and doing things, and if you aren't fitting into that mold then you're going about life the wrong way? 

 I just can't decide if you're saying that everyone should follow the mold set by the Hero's Journey, or if the implicit fact is that we're all doing that regardless of what kind of story we're involved in, be it that we're ""good"" or ""bad."""

UggEX0Uorl13sHgCoAEC,rh001YT,1504484911902,"Anyone who is bullied is in fact a wimp that attracts bullying.   I'm not just blaming the wimp, the bully is equally to blame.  In both cases one or both parents are to blame.  In almost all cases the wimp male has a father who is a wimp who is married to a woman who is a bully. The bully male has a father who is a bully married to a woman who is a wimp.  And vice versa for the female wimp and bully.  

To get over being a bullied wimp the wimp must recognize his/her wimpiness and then acknowledge how it was that one of their parents are to blame. Then to deal with the bully it is usually only necessary to say, after an episode of bullying, calmly and without emotion, ""why are you treating me unjustly"".  Any other reaction to the bully, such as anger or submission or even as Dr. Peterson suggests, documenting the bullying, is a reaction, and it is the reaction that the bully seeks and that reinforces his/her desire to continue bullying.  Non-reaction will eventually work by the bully backing off, or the bully will sort of self-destruct by abusing alcohol or drugs and then will somehow get himself fired.  Another outcome is that the bully moves on to bullying someone else who will react, which is not good for that wimp but is at least good for the wimp that learned or chose non-reaction. 

It is also necessary for the wimp to understand the the bully has been a victim of one or both parents, just as was/is the wimp, there being only a difference in polarity due to random unluckiness.  

This principal and it's solution was exemplified in the New Testament when, after being arrested by Roman police, and after Peter had reacted and sliced off the ear of one of the policmen, Jesus told Peter to stand down, and then Jesus reattached the policeman's ear. 

A similar story is that of M. Gandhi who exasperated the English colonial rulers by not reacting to their bullying....he just asked them why were they treating him unjustly and looked at them with those Gandhi eyes.  As other Indians took up Gandhi's ways the English became more exasperated.  The English preferred the violent part of the Indian revolt because they could portray those freedom fighters as criminals or insane. .   Gandhi had actually exasperated the English to such an extent that they were planning to make major concessions to ease the burden they had placed on the Indian people (whom they were bullying) when it just so happened that WW2 bankrupted England and they had to give full Independence simply because they could no longer afford the troop levels in India needed to continue the bullying."

For example, if I stand up to someone, as you suggested earlier in the talk, they may go away upset that they cannot control me, and I may go away shaking a bit from the confrontation. In such a case, any of the following are possible: 1) we both agree that we are better, 2) one agrees he/she is better and the other doesn't, 3) neither agree they are better.

I long time ago, I watched this late night documentary on BBC2 UK (when it was the Open University Channel) on a thinker who stumbled onto something, that has stuck with me for a very long time. However, I for the life of me cant remember the name of this 18th Century philosopher name, so I have not been able to look into him since. He was well off, and was dedicated to the study of Altruism. He went into this in some depth, even taking in the homeless into his house to look after them, even allowing them to take/steal things from him, until he ended up penniless. In the end as an ultimate test about God and Altruism in his work he slit his own throat believing some say to see if he would have stopped himself. That was not my interest though! He has stumbled across some phenomena about Time and the Void, that was startling to me and was something my own philosophic work had touched upon. Anyway never heard of him since and not been able to track down the documentary either. He was quite well known, I think he published some books too, but he certainly was not a main person. I think he also did some work on mathematics, maybe, from memory. If you know of this guy, or anyone else, please respond. His work is well worth it. Anyone else know of the French guy who was institutionalised from a young man who constantly made winged aircraft from his bicycle until they psychiatrically institutionalised him until he was an old man, only to find that when he was released he went straight back to making winged aircraft from his bike and rode it down the pathways again. Or what about the 1800 Guy who developed special weights and a jumping techniques that enabled him to jump rivers, which was a sport in the 1800. One day he was tested by rich lords, in which one lay on the blue spot of a full size snooker table with the boy jumping from one end to the other barefoot and putting blue chalk on the Lords nose. This was because his famous technique of river jumping was seen to have him almost jump of the middle of the lake of water! Those to last ones would make great cartoons or Disney Stories. These three names I have been searching for over 25 years."

The value in understanding this is immeasurable, especially if your primary goal is psychotherapy, or other such helping professions; even diplomacy and other such important political and military affairs! There are multiple ways of looking at the world! Literally, different ways of looking at the information; even to the idea of what information actually is, what is defined as worth being known. What you see, is determined by your fundamental values - and these values are not even close the capacity of the individual to consciously choosing their own values - it is much deeper than that; fundamental values determine perception; perception determines what you see, and values determine how you will see it. It is much deeper than this, and I can't even scratch the surface yet, but to understand this is so very helpful. Then it is a matter of learning the skills through committed discipline of more accurate communication abilities, and the ability to control ones emotional reactions in conversations that you find repugnant; because for the aforementioned reasons - because the way that you look at the world is different and how you look at the world is different; perhaps even more strange, that they way you do this, in relevance to the set of topics at hand, may be inaccurate."

It's enclosed in a smooth, regular, simple-looking housing. Open up the housing and there's a NG-powered engine with a dynamo attached; as complex-looking as any other engine. But you don't want to look at that most of the time. It also comes with an automatic transfer switch.

UgyhCUGiJcvRnOgeRXh4AaABAg,Catreece MacLeod,1504484953547,"Figured you'd want an update on your information - the origin of life isn't nearly the mystery you made it out to be at 52:18 after all. Like we know DNA is far too complex to have developed on its own, not just because of the DNA issue, but also because of the additional supporting structures that are required for DNA to exist, such as mitochondria and proteins, as well as being able to interact with enzymes.

RNA, however, can synthesize proteins in a way DNA can't, can interact with enzymes easily (a bit too easily one might say), and uses a much simpler sugar molecule. It's vastly, vastly more likely to occur naturally, and basically does a ton of different jobs - most of them rather poorly compared to more specialized components like DNA, but the important part is that it's able to do those tasks in the first place, even if at minimal levels.

This is why a lot of viruses and single celled organisms don't have DNA at all, only RNA.

Now, since the way RNA works to transfer genetic information within a cell means that DNA physically can't create proteins without RNA present, it means that you couldn't have just had DNA start out as the initial form of life. In fact, it's physically impossible for it to be part of the initial biogenesis process. It's not 100% guaranteed that RNA is what life would have started with, but it's excessively likely because of how it works and we already see RNA as being an integral part of how cells operate, so it'd be really weird if life started with something else then changed over to RNA, then to DNA. It makes vastly more sense for life to have started with RNA as its core genetic component.

So yeah, creating RNA is actually pretty easy, and it basically brings all its supporting structures with it as part of itself. It doesn't do a very good job of most of those other things, but it's able to do almost everything by itself. Life would almost have guaranteed started with RNA, it wouldn't have been all that difficult to do, and DNA would've formed quite a bit later on afterward, taking on a more specialized role once the other parts of single-celled life had managed to be formed independently. Basically, you're looking at a gap of at least a few million years, with the current estimate being somewhere over 750 million, between the initial biogenesis event and the advent of DNA.

What's more fun is that there were probably at least two biogenesis events on Earth, which shouldn't really be surprising once the conditions turned favourable for such. Felisa Wolfe-Simon's work on GFAJ-1 hints that there may have been an arsenic-based biogensis event, though it's been since proven that the arsenic doesn't get incorporated directly into the DNA in place of phosphorus. That doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the second genesis event, only that it's much less likely.

Anyway, sorry, kinda getting off on tangents now. The point is just that no, DNA would not have been the origin of life, and we've since stopped even considering such as a reasonable possibility. Also, even Francis Crick, the one you mention directly, is well aware that some viruses are based off of RNA alone, and that they appear more primitive and seem to be closer to the original structures used before DNA would have been created. And I say created because DNA has to be synthesized by other established parts of a cell, it wouldn't have just spontaneously formed like RNA can. So yeah, the idea of DNA just appearing out of nowhere at the origin of life is kind of absurd, which we now realize. As far as I'm aware, there is no one even trying to perform experiments to see if they can generate life with DNA from component parts spontaneously, pretty much all that research is now being done with RNA instead as the basis of the initial biogenesis event.

For more information, contact your nearest exobiologist who will have waaay more information than I do on this kind of stuff. =P"

Something that seems safe to say is that one's progress or survival depends on it."

Ugje9hFD4-muQngCoAEC,TheTygertiger,1504484963934,"What he says about seeing the snake and jumping into the air without having first gone through a real thought process is so true. I'm really scared of snakes and I tend to scream when I'm suddenly and unexpectedly seeing one. I've been known to scream in a pet shop when I turned the wrong corner and all of a sudden saw a snake in its terrarium. One time I experienced a scream and run episode where I really didn't have time to really see the snake before I reacted, just like professor Peterson explained.

I was helping some friends to move some furniture into their house. They were living upstairs and they had a storage room on ground floor where the new furniture was carried into from the moving trailer. My boyfriend and one of the guys living in the flat were carrying a sofa or something into the storage room and I was behind them telling them which way to turn etc. The other guy who lived in the flat too came walking down the stairs. He held his arm weirdly pointing forward and I remember thinking: ""Why is he holding his arm so strangely?"" Then I noticed a long blotch of light color on his arm and I can't remember which came first. Did the idea of a snake flash in my head first or did I first start screaming and then directly had the idea of a snake flash in my mind? I let out such a bloodcurdling scream that the guys had never heard anything like it and I ran back through the open door into the backyard where I stood screaming and shaking until my boyfriend came to hold me and got me to calm down enough to stop screaming. 

The guy had meant to scare my boyfriend by sneaking up on him with his pet snake, but that plan was foiled by my reaction. The snake was no longer than his forearm and maybe as thick as his thumb. When I started screaming and running, there were 2 guys and a sofa between me and the snake, and the distance was maybe 5-6 meters. I really couldn't see it well enough under the circumstances to know consciously that it really was a snake. I don't remember even seeing any movement which would have told me that it was a living thing on his arm. Somehow my monkey brain just recognized it as a snake and off I went."

Even a relatively low impact blow (enough to produce mild concussion or even just dizziness) disrupts or warps my experience of me and the world, consciousness basically. Whereas a similar low impact blow to, say, the leg typically only disrupts the leg. 

I've also had some trouble with sensitive nerves in my elbow, and when I have a problem there, I can feel the pain shock traveling up the arm, and when it hits the neck/head is when I black out. So if I think of ""me"" as the entity doing the perception of the world, and head is where you shut that down the EASIEST, then that's an example of how one would intuitively arrive at the ""self is in the head"" conclusion."

(Funnily, I used to feel it in my chest - I associated it with my heart and conscience (which was a learned association), and in a way the chest is also the centre of my body).

Since then I've had a pretty phenomenological ""perspective"", where I pretty much just see everything I'm experiencing as me (but also as not me, because basically I'm not really making that division much anymore, so it's seen as all one thing).

I wonder, because the players do not react to the gorilla walking on and chest beating, the curtain changing colour, or the player walking off, as you would expect if any or all of those things were to actually happen, doesn't that puts those events in the group of things that are 'not important, not dangerous, etc' and so can be ignored in this case because the events do not interfere with the task driven goal of the viewer?"

 I respect your work a lot, but you've been saying something that is not accurate.
You said the majority of the wealth always accumulate in the hands of a few, this is of course true when it comes to money and nominal value of assets, or when it comes to totalitarian regimes, but is definitely not true when it comes to free market capitalism (hence why so many have been lifted out of poverty in a system that more or less resembles free market capitalism).

But in a free market economy the wealth accumulated by the top is just a small fraction of the wealth outputted from them to the world.
Meaning, the top 1-10% do not own the majority of the cars, food, clothes, furniture, mobile phones, computers, etc... Those things (the wealth) is owned by the people, the top 1% only have the stocks of some of the companies producing all this wealth but not the wealth itself, and a lot of those companies are divided in shares that are owned by the people. 

I just would like to point that out, because the way you say it makes it sound completely unfair and as if there was a problem that needed solving, which is absolutely not the case, the problem has been solved and the solution is free market capitalism."

Obviously it is true within the context of the particular experiment but it doesn't represent a ""real world"" scenario in that people are watching it sitting down in a chair or whatever, so they are not physiologically primed for action and are not anticipating any threat from the environment. It makes no sense that somebody in the Jungle (say) would only be paying attention to their desired action and be oblivious to the predator creeping up on them. It would be interesting to see a more realistic version of the experiment. Also one way of validating or disproving the authenticity of the experiment would be to create something similar and then use hypnotic regression in somnambulism to ascertain whether those who didn't see the anomalous information were actually aware of it subconsciously. I just think it is a bit premature to assume that the conclusion of the experiment is valid without further investigation."

UgxKOraDE9RhiV6vDld4AaABAg,SixSixSix,1533342399087,"I disagree with that point from Hume that JP keeps quoting  -- ""you can't derive an ought from an is"". 

I think you can definitely derive an ought from an is, with decent reasoning : 
For example : ""I know this berry is poisonous . Therefore, if I want to avoid dying , I ought to not eat it"".

or ""I know this chimp is a cruel tyrant, but since he is much larger than me and could tear me into pieces, I ought to not engage him, until I am sure I have enough support from the other chimps.""

There is a logical jump or skipping point there -- ie. why would you want to avoid dying? What is the logic behind that? But that's just the limit of our understanding of logic -- and this is where some bare basic intuition in terms of being a living organism comes in. 
The biological survival program is pre-written. Why is it written that way ? Don't know -- that's just the program logic which has developed.

You don't need to know the deepest level of a programming logic in order to see that there are processes which will make a program work or break. 
You can know how to write code in the C# language, without having to know exactly the mechanics of where all the 1's and 0's are going , or even knowing assembly language -- and you can see that what appears on the surface represents definite processes which are interlinked beneath the software layer.

Cultural and scientific updates are like software updates. Sometimes it makes the software worse, but usually it frequently makes things better and more user-friendly.

I don't see where the supposed ""massive difficulty"" about basing a reasonable morality or basis for action is in this sort of thinking."

That's a better way of framing the theory I've had for many years that our memories become better with a larger vocabulary. So what is vocabulary? It's a linguistic representation of the world. If we can more accurately describe our experiences, we can more easily retain them.

One of my biggest frustrations in life is coming up with amazingly profound concepts, but then finding out someone has beaten me to the punch when I get excited and tell more academic people about my revelations. Imagine if you recreated the Vitruvian man without ever having seen it or even knowing who Leonardo da Vinci was, and then you proudly show people what you've discovered, but then they scoff at you and declare you didn't create it because someone you never heard of did it long before you. You'd be pretty frustrated, because you accomplished something transcendentally profound, but no one recognizes your accomplishment.

The solace I take in knowing when I've created or discovered something that geniuses before me already exposed to the world is that I'm at least partially on their level. Sometimes happiness must come from within, and to hell with other people's lack of praise."

Everything is instant.  Technically speaking, their intelligence would cease to exist within the current landscape of possibility.  It's like they become ""omniscient""--they know everything all at once--which renders them impotent, despite being embodied.  ?

""Better"" only in the sense of reducing human effort at the point of felling. What of the human effort and collusion required to produce the tools? So, perhaps ""better"" in the sense of overall economy of human effort in trees felled. But an individual can fell a tree by fashioning a stone ax that requires no mining,   smelting, or collusion with others for its production. The tree can be brought down with tools collected from your surroundings with one's own effort. So, maybe the analogy is apt because you could observe and figure it all out yourself, but that will take a very long time and you wouldn't fell many trees over your lifetime. You could understand more by utilizing the collective efforts of others."

Language falls short in describing the world and feelings; the unspoken horror of childhood trauma one of the reason for therapy as painting, movement, music, no words treatments. All the emphasis later on putting it into writing will construe rational and FALSE explanation for what is buried and suppressed because at the time of happening of that trauma the words were not there. The feelings of rage or freeze-helplessness are buried with no word labels- just image, sounds, and smell. The resent neurochemistry demonstrated that it is even worse. Such experiences locked into R hemisphere of the brain (not just limbic – this word should be eliminated, because in human it is FUSED through the neuro-circuits with the frontal cortex) and run their own bizarre circle of rage without conscious approval.  The pause (count to ten and breath) does not work for irrational- every time the trigger is pushed the survival kicks in, although the true issue of survival does not apply anymore. The problem is that the people who do not have buried trauma –majority, thankfully, do not understand it, and pitch meditation and mindfulness, journaling as cure for all. It happens as well in adult victim of PTSD; but in case of an adult it has labels – words; which makes it possible for blah-blah therapy."

I know you are not a friend of Marxs, neither am I - so maybe you don't mention him because he fell in love with the marxist idea for some part of his intellectual career but became disillusioned by it and abandoned it. he never went on the nazi train and his book ""the mass psychology of fascism"" was one radical and powerful book during the time of it's publication (around 1930 I think) I mean I think it is still a very powerful and radical book... so why not give the man some little credit?"

Then, yesterday evening, I wrote that this thing he calls pure experience is lack of interpretation from a limiting paradigm. We have to use a paradigm to interpret the world and we are unable to create a paradigm that is complex enough to represent reality correctly. Even this explanation is an interpretation, so I don't think that the explanation is complete. I'm just amazed that someone came to the same conclusion, since I've always felt very alone with these thoughts."
UghFGOjL0kinfHgCoAEC,rh001YT,1504484922970,"This is a good lecture, but for those wanting a better understanding of these kinds of issues I recommend Kant's ""Critique of Pure Reason"",  wherein he gives a very accurate description of how the mind works on say a data processing and symbolic level, not getting into neuro-science as such had not been invented.  But Kant's book CPR is the basis of cognitive science and computer programming.

It is impossible to condense CPR because it is dense, which is typical of many Germans of the 18th century.  

I don't know for sure but I suspect Piaget based much of his underlying theory on Kant.

Here is a nutshell that is far from comprehensive:

1) The human is born with a mind that is blank of data, but does have templates or concepts into which data is fit, and no data that does not fit becomes known data...such data is excluded without even knowing it has been excluded.   
2) The foundational base concept, on which all other concepts rely, is spatio-temporal reasoning, meaning we can only think or concieve of the world in space, or dimensions,  and time, and those two, space and time are completely linked, can't have one without the other.
3) Then there is something else, sorting and sifting.  Since all data is arranged or slotted by the one template there is great similarity between data sets.  The sorting and sifting engine can compare data sets and find the significant similarities between some of them which then allows for guesses at general principles that may be governing the data sets. So for instance wave behavior in ponds resembled  wave behavior of sound waves and  frequencies beyond sound and so on.  Each data set of different wave behaviors was gathered only in certain particular situations but then sorting and sifting suggested something in common. So obviously data about apples did not contribute to wave theory. 
4) the math engine: the math engine itself is part of the conceptual template and is already there before any data is recieved. The math engine and he conceptual template may be one and the same.  Because humans can tell that math is self-validating it is used as a test to determine if suspected general rules might be candidates for general rules that are as self-evident as math.  So from disparate slices of wave data a math-consistent set of general rules was worked out, and that set of rules suggested wave frequencies may extend all the was up and down.  With the math-consistency providing some certainty about the guess, humans will make the effort to find missing data which is still needed to prove out the guess. And so all sorts of contraptions were build by scientists to trap or trick other frequencies into revealing themselves, and that worked well, and led to general electo-magnetic wave theory.   
5) For some reason Kant did not explain but pointed out, humans seek data to fill the empty templates. This is what we see happening when infants and toddlers touch and taste everything.  They are not yet seeing the world clearly, as their templates are mostly empty. By age of about 3 or 4 the toddler is actually seeing, hearing, etc the world pretty much the same  as anyone older such as teens and adults.  It's not that toddlers have blurry vision or a dull sense of smell, taste, touch, etc, it's that they have no idea what it is their sensing.  When the templates begin to be filled then the human sees the world, but only in the shape or organization of that template.  
6) Because humans are driven to seek data, as if the template itself demands more filling out, they seek up to infinity and down to infinity because the math underlying the template, or math being the template, readily suggests infinity like multiplication or division by 0.  

Lastly, Kant noted that if the templates(which are the concepts), and the math that forms them or grounds them or is one and the same with them contain errors then A) we will never know and B) there could be more ""stuff"" (my word) going on around us to which we are totally and permanently blind.  But we will just never know.  So we can only work with what we have as no choice of another template is available to us.  And then we might wonder what is more likely, that our most basic and fundamental tool for oraganizing the sensible world into consciousness is perfect, or imperfect? Still we will never know so we have to work with what we have. 

With regards Piaget, Kuhn, others, I go primarily with a Kantian view that there are not revolutions in science or knowledge or anything but gradual filling out of the templates.  Think of the templates as a database, and it's obvious that Kant's CPR forms the basic first idea of a database. We keep adding to the database and then sort and sift for similarities and differences to suggest general rules or partial general rules that then suggest more effort into finding out how valid those rules are, and if they are found valid or even 85% valid, such will often lead to finding new ways to manipulate the natural world.   And with more and more data, higher level rules may emerge that would not emerge with less data."

UghdVHctCAbo2XgCoAEC,andriod84,1504484923018,"Perhaps this is a good backbone for figuring out what psychedelics do to a person in the trip. Some people seem to say they feel like they revert to a child like innocence when in the trip. Perhaps they influence multiple 'action' sides of the model more then what would normally happen. A little tweak in one action when not tripping would not do anything, but because your high in the trip your doing multiple actions you wouldn't have done (all basically at once) this cascades to a different end point even though each action you do might only have been tweaked slightly.

  It might explain why psychedelics work the way they do, linking the mental effects with physical actions. Set and setting play an important part in a trip as well so how you interact with your physical actions during the trip would definitely influence you during and after the trip and might also explain better a 'bad trip'.

The last few days I've been thinking about what I call the ""holy family"". Father-Mother-Brother-Sister. And how fascinating it is that the same person can exist inside this framework but overtime, change roles. One lives as a son with a sister, mother, and father, and then 20 years later lives as a father with a wife, son, and daughter. And even if we didn't have a father growing up, we have a psychological ""father"" built into us, and a psychological mother, and sister, and so on. In other words we have these archetypes and we can't escape them. Western Civilization has been slowly but steadily erasing the father from the family. But something always has to take place of that. In the same way that the death of God leads to ideology and/or nihilism, the death of the father leads to much of the same, as the father in a child's life plays the role of ""God the Father"". One is protected by the father, one loves the father, and one fears the father. But if there is no father then one begins to love/fear and seek protection from some abstract version of the father, such as the state, or gangs, or capitalism, or communism, or what have you."

UghBDVSKfdnSiXgCoAEC,professormaxtrinity,1504484959820,"It's mind blowing to me that anyone could even perceive  current human experience through the notion of there being no gap between ""is"" and ""ought"". My own firsthand experience tells me that, I live in the very noticeable tension between is and ought. It's within that gap that I developed my ow personal mores and moral criteria. It's in that infinite creative  gap that I play with and develop ideas. Also, it seems that to suppose there is no gap is to suppose that all is as it ought to be or that, there is no ""ought"". These suppositions are true from a reflective and abstract sort of mental play but, they don't apply to living in real time social structure with millions of other free agents of creativity. They are more germane to the ground of imagination that we develop and pull ideas out of.

The gap and the gentle but, visceral tension of play between is and ought is observable and can be tracked through associative and emergence aspects of learning. Epiphanies can be traced back through trails of associations that lead to root assumptions. That's part of what makes the experience epiphanous , it's a full circle culmination quality of something that was building that you're unaware of until the moment of epiphany. In that instant you have a mini version of a classic N.D.E. life review only it's focused on  your experience with a particular subject. Epiphanies are emergent culminations of building knowledge and demonstrate directly, the inherent energetic state of knowledge. The tension between is and ought, the gap, is the fertile energy ground where all the associative play is executed and provides the conditions for learning, for epiphanies and peak experiences and for the creative molding of personal philosophies and personal paradigms. And that is just as it ought to be, lol. Just sayin'"

The fact that both ex nihilo cosmology and quantum mechanics in particle physics are incomplete models (and that is putting it nicely) means that we don't fully understand anything... at least as far as I can see, but feel free to show otherwise. EDIT: Jordan did eventually say that ""Newton was wrong"" so it seems we agree.

In any case, as I expected, Jordan's position on ""truth"" is more nuanced than Sam Harris'... At least according to my understanding of the best that current philosophy of science has to offer. And, no, this is not ""relativism"". It is about being humble and honest about how difficult it is to achieve absolute certainty.

Ugh2w9eGOMENm3gCoAEC,Julia Nelson,1504484970441,"***synthesis moment***Pain, emotional pain, is a response to not getting what you want from the world. Like physical pain, it is a signal that something about the harmony of your system has met an obstruction, it cannot flourish.. The shattering of perceptions that appeared to be working until they didn't. --- The tower that  you built has fallen, and hopefully something is resurrected from the rubble  (maybe after spending 3 days in a tomb  ) . --- how many times do your walls have to be shattered before you notice the thing coming from afar, after learning the signs and symptoms. --- how many times I have been caught saying, oh..this thing again? I thought I was above this, jeez. Why was I so blind? --- Developing sight really does seems to summarize the lesson here. 

I'm interested in the idea of what is relevant and that which engages our attention. It really gets me when it comes to identity politics. While I empathize with many of my fellow US citizens about their pain (race issues, humans rights, guns etc) what really engages my attention and emotional systems is the environmentalism story. I like the environmentalism story because it appears to me that none of that other stuff will really matter when the ocean is so acidic no one can swim in it , all the water is polluted, and I can't go outside anymore because my skin can't take the sun. People may agonize over whether or not the media is body shaming women and what campaign we must follow to stop the degradation of our girls and women, but they'll still take a plane (by far the largest polluter when it comes to travel) to vacation in Hawaii.  Perhaps, it's because the environmental catastrophe is still too abstract to engage their attention. You have said ""people don't have ideas, ideas have people"" is it ideology that captures the imagination so heavily that it becomes blind to everything outside of it? They consider flying all over the world for pleasure to be a normal activity for a person in their position. 

How do I extrapolate that  my environmental awareness is the way to be in world that constitutes a moral truth? When someone else might say that it is relative to whatever is close enough to my heart strings for me to care. It feels like we live in a world where we are constantly flooded with information asking us what to care about. It's extremely overwhelming.

UgidXhWkOkUrsXgCoAEC,Brutally Honest Bear,1504484970841,"Taking the mouse example further sir, when the child becomes an adolescent and subsequently a young adult, this pattern simply changes from looking at the mother (parent/guardian) to their peers and teachers. Now with the plethora of social media bombarding them as well, the sheer volume of situations/reactions they are absorbing is off the charts. One might presume this high volume of reinforcement of reactions (in our echo chamber world), must lead to more entrenched positions and perhaps is causal to a larger (apparent) reference to feelings over facts. 

Wouldn't this higher volume and concentrated feedback loop of reactions result in the person having a significantly harder time getting to that new level of understanding you spoke about at the start?

Is it possible we are seeing a generation (or two) of people who will not be able to, mature, for a lack of a better word? 

Could we start seeing a devolution in our ability to individually separate real danger from the collective noise?

Aside from that, I'm very intrigued about the ""collective unconscious"", which in some sense you could attribute as ""nurtural"" inheritance, in parallel with ""natural"" (genetic) inheritance. The way you raise your children, in all its aspects (parents, environments, habits(!)), will be roughly the same as to how you were raised, and that to how your parents were raised, and so on, for thousands of years. Perhaps this is very subjective: I sometimes feel like ""nurture"" is put aside as a simple attribution; ""How well one is raised"" (whatever ""well"" would mean). But considering how incredibly many, small, subtle, little habits, like motorics/movements, intonations, facial expressions, have descended into your own from thousands of years of mimicking one's parents, I think it's a very complex aspect of one's development. And it makes it really interesting to look at ""is it nature or nurture?""-types of issues."

UggdgVvHXWont3gCoAEC,Rince wind,1472948511402,"What Nietzche said about suffering and relgion is very interesting. The christian belief of Sin gives meaning to human suffering. When something unexpected and bad has happened, the religious human asks himself why this has happened to him, and is immedeately reminded of his sins. The ideal sinless human is in truth impossible to live up to, and therefore every human is a sinner. This idea of humans being born sinners immideately seems kind of unfair, but is it really? Hitler did not think that his bad luck early in life where due to himself being a sinner. He projected the anger outward - resulting in millions of dead jews. This was of course exactly what Nietzche prophesised would happen due to secularization. Sin gives an introspective meaning to suffering, with the lack of meaning we are liable to create one, and project the suffering outside ourselves. The idea of sin is a much better way of dealing with suffering. We know that only when directing suffering inwards do we stand the possibility to grow as a human being. As far as I understand, rationalism and science can not provide us with such a subpersonality built to handle suffering. So ... I believe we are just as vunerable today as we were in the 1930s. The idea of sin might not be true .., it is an esthetic idea. Esthetics teaches us to live with elegance. Like the Elves in Tolkiens universe, that kind of life is possible, its not pure fantasy. It is a question if you understand the esthetics of life or not. In our era we do not understand the esthetics of life. We think that these esthetic guiding principles are for dreamers and naive people, but it is far from it. On the contrary, I would say that its is to clever, and demanding for people to understand. In the same way it is difficult to write a great novel - due to strict demands on the writers sense of esthetics - it is demanding to live this way. Especially when we have been brought up in a society very much opposed to it."

Only in the area of ""antisocials""
You should specify the actual diagnosis: antisocial personality disorder (there is a difference), you know this.

There are more than enough ""antisocial"" people who are not aggressive/violent
Even those who, like myself, are misanthropes.

You are putting out the idea that all (men mostly) who prefer to be alone, are likely to be dangerous.
Thus, you are spreading this inaccurate assumption to groups of people, as well as along ""social"" media.

It would be nice to see you restructure this topic.
I mean, it is not so much that this is ""misinformation"", rather more that it is delivered in a way/context, where it can be easily misunderstood.

True, criminals might be low in conscientiousness and low in agreeableness, and might gravitate towards political life as a result, but it can be argued that those people are the most agreeable people after all because they just obey whatever money chases.  They simply replaced people with money in terms of what they trust.  On the other hand, if we replaced money at the heart of our basis for trust in the world, we would see ""disagreeable"" people change their tune in a hurry.  We could do that by replacing the monetary basis with a chain of personal trust, demanding that each person have a personal contact with whom they wished to enter into a mutually trustworthy relationship with - linking every person to the top of the social hierarchy.   We should be able to realize that there are more productive motives than profit, and JP even admits that this is true for young men in general, however he quickly proceeds to contradict himself by stating that there's only one alternative to not playing the money game, and that's rotting to death by doing nothing.

Politically aspect.
------------
A light government that value the individual is democratic, the rest are socialist.

PC liberalism is an oxymoron, since can't be exist liberalism under the PC ideology (1).

If you open the border of the State you known exactly what happen for several reasons as:
- incompatible culture with the hosted Nations
- benefits without productivity and without time limit
- etc.
Welfare (beside bureaucracy), the source of all evil,  despite the fatal attraction that promote. 

---------------
Aggressiveness.
On children is just a primordial instinctive response to define a hierarchy.
A children must be educate to convey his energies on a manner compatible with a civil society.

---------------
The major difference between a civil democratic society and a don't liberal one is the lack of freedom of speech. 
The speech is an instrument used as substitute for the violence between individuals, so a speech can be harsh, don't respectful, etc..Now if you want an higher probabilities to change other opinions is better use a polite form, nothing more, nothing less.
Exist other points but perhaps I speak later about that.

1) When you impose (as legislation, rules, etc) how you must speak and later on which argument can be touched, you use the violence of the State, so you no longer live in a democratic society and you have no more freedom of speech."

Maybe its because I had a disagreement with other people about the passions I have with my stuff, like making music, videos, drawing pictures, and more, and feeling like maybe I'm just not as good as I am, and trying to argue about these things to prove I am, but ultimately making it worse, I have zero clue why, and maybe I'm over thinking this, but honestly, I feel like these first 9 minutes are so me, and for some reason it makes me sad.

Makes me more sad because I'm not even a woman, I am a male, maybe its because I have a higher amount of estrogen in me (I have natural man-boobs that are pretty notable tbh, so that's why I say that) than most males, I'm not sure.

Maybe its because I have aspergers?  I am still not sure, or maybe I'm just over thinking it, I really don't know, but whatever the reason, this video is striking a cord with me, and while I'm still crying, and probably will cry some more once I watch more, I thank you for making this video.

The only thing that differs is that they allegedly do not wish to see borders towards Chaos at large, but in truth they set them up in the small: Their safe spaces are nothing but artificial paradises supposed to keep the unwanted threats of their perception out, while also setting up their own classically chauvinistic borders towards their chosen combinations of superficial traits to be inferior to all the rest of humanity as they define it.

But even a child can give a full-grown man a deadly kick to the balls. Striking with proper form, and having the intent to harm the other person is key. I think the reason why women hitting their husbands are less likely to cause them harm is because they are not punching them with the full intent to seriously injure them in a vital area. And here you could say that agreeableness contributes to the lack of intent to harm. On the other hand, agreeableness can also contribute to an overwhelming determination to harm, in the defense of family.

Now don't worry - I knew these professors were batshit crazy and didn't take them seriously.  It's always been extremely obvious to me that men and women are wired differently, and are very different emotionally, for obvious biological reasons.

I'm extremely disorderly with my home, I always have been. It was kinda beaten into me in elementary school that that was the way to go. Elementary school was so easy that I never did homework, I was actually reprimanded for making the amount I was comfortable with, which for math and native language class were the whole books the first day. I didn't need my books most of the time because in my home elementary school knowledge was common knowledge. I pretty much did what I wanted in school and had my own projects at home. As such I never really learned to form a schedule and stick to it. 

Now I've got a depression because of Asperger's Syndrome. I fight against my weakness of poor social skills and it takes a toll, but it's hard not to do it. All this makes my bad habits shine through even more, it's hard to find the extra energy to deal with something ""I don't notice, something that doesn't bother me""(48:06).. Living in an extremely messy home is counter-intuitive to what I want though(social equality between me and peers), so maybe I should pay more attention. Would love some advise on how to give a damn about it.

I'm not exaggerating about school and how it affected me. I've had my IQ tested and I'm north of 150, the only area the doctors and guys at Mensa could discern I'm even near average is the social intellect and that's a tad lower than average. Just like a psychopath you can meet me on the street and I can pretend to be normal, but get to know me and you'll see that I'm different, in good and bad ways. Like deliberately betraying someone's trust is a foreign concept for me, I've just never done it.

I felt compelled to write this comment to thank you. You came to my attention, like many others, through your free speech battles, but this series and your other philosophical work has given me profound insight into my psyche and given me tools and ideas to work on for my own betterment.

While I'm grateful for this, what I really grateful for is giving me the framework to help someone else, someone who I care very deeply about and love very much, my partner. She has suffered with depression since she was in her mid teens and had a quite turbulent child hood. In the past when she would have a bad time or hit a low point I could be there for her as at best a comfort, which of course has value, but thanks to the lessons I have learned from your lectures I have been able to talk to her about her feelings. We did what you advocate and spoke the truth and see what happened. 

What happened was we had an intense but deeply gratifying conversation. One that didn't just sooth her, but one I think will help her grow, and in that process I felt I have grown and our relationship has become stronger.

She will be seeing a counsellor soon but I walked her through the big 5 attributes and suggested some actions from the past authoring suite and she took to the ideas really well. She has a lot of baggage from her past, so facing these will be tough, but she saw the value in doing it.

So I wanted to thank you for giving me the tools to sort myself out, but also help my partner sort herself out."

Interesting how science is bearing out what was earlier repudiated as merely ""imposed by religious authority"" as based in quantifiable truths of human behavior.  Religion served as an efficient means of carrying forward the most important human wisdom, and abandoning it has resulted in the dystopia we have today."
UgibdK6-hR1R5HgCoAEC,Michael Froelich,1504485311153,"I'm highly empathetic but when I perceive wickedness I never shrink from conflict.   I would not harm or kill an animal because I'm always wishing it well and hoping it's contented.   But if I perceive someone as monsterously wicked I have no problem imposing terrible punishments on them which I perceive they deserve.   And I'm thinking about their malice and cruelty to others, such as the animals I feel for, when I'm torturing them.  Therefore  I'm not sure the framework here comports with my experiences or observations.    I think the problem lies in grounding traits in evolutionary biological terms.    I think the development of personality isn't determined by evolutionary factors.    Humans exist on a different level of consciousness than animals, truly.   For example, I know a lot of women indifferent to others, including their own children.   I think if females show up as more agreeable on tests it's because of their need for acceptance.   Females will become fractured psychologically if they feel unworthy or not accepted.    Their agreeableness isn't empathy, but a strategy for finding acceptance by not wanting to stick out.   Young girls who are gifted and therefore different will hide their giftedness and exceptionalism so they will fit in and not be resented by others.    Boys would never do that.   Neither do boys starve themselves because they perceive their bodies as unattractively fat, or misperceive themselves as fat when they are not fat.    These are not founded in evolution but in the independence vs. dependence variation, with girls being completely dependent on their peers for emotional contentment whereas some boys want to be independent and stand out from others as exceptional.   As well there's confusion here about the traits of criminals.    Among professional criminals and those in prison there is wide variation.    There are predatory personalities and also empathetic personalities.     The most successful criminals are those who care about the well being of others, and therefore gain a reputation for honesty and fairness.     Only the born to lose idiots who never succeed at crime are the ones Peterson is describing here.     That applies only to the criminal world, which is actually a community.    On the other hand sociopaths who cheat everyone they encounter do not live in any community, but in large cities or they travel from place to place cheating everyone they meet.    Those are the people who cannot thrive in the underworld, and in the underworld those kinds of predatory individuals are loathed.    If Peterson understood criminality better he would view it as the economic and financial system it is rather than as an antisocial phenomenon.     Criminals are people seeking to find money.     And one last big thing.    Peterson's observations about the importance of socialization among peers for young children only applies to this culture, where children are thrown together in class rooms.    That is a very recent phenomena.    Until a hundred years or so ago children were not in groups of other children.    Children used to be socialized into their family or community in which their age group peers were not the determining factor.    Peterson's description of this purely recent, and frankly strange, way of treating children as a basic human condition is way off the mark.     I think the truth is that children were never intended to be socialized with their own peer group, and doing so has created these stresses and issues only recently.     Children should not be permitted to form their own cultures apart from that of their adult communities."

what common purpose can aggrable people work towards when they see their peers and mostly themselves as children, being acted upon with no agency
, now if you define cooperation as non conflicting then perhaps but, that's not cooperation

if cooperation is working towards a common goal i don't think agreeable people will beat disagreeable people at that game..... for example soldiers, police, company directors and such staff even scientists perhaps

well the thing is the more competitive you are the more cooperative you are, to compete you have to cooperate

Moreover men are much more cooperative (by the definition of working towards a common goal) than women, well there could be other explanations for that, but the highest difference in trait aggreablness is among gender would support that the higher disaggrablness is more cooperation 

i don't know which"

UgwAzys6zM9I1WyiaIt4AaABAg,JarrodDSchneider,1504485327144,"A kind of beautiful irony has emerged during my own implementation of some of Peterson's self-authoring ideas. Each morning I ask myself what things I don't want to do but need to do in order to solve the myriad problems I have brought upon myself; taking this into account, I then write down my vision of heaven and hell for the day. Heaven is the sense of utmost accomplishment I would have were I to optimally address my problems. Hell is the complete abandonment of my goals and the backslide into depression and anxiety that would occur as a result. The thing is, I always fall short of heaven- I always fail to optimally remedy my problems to the height of my own satisfaction, and yet I still manage to slightly progress and climb a little more out of the hole I have dug for myself. Although this technically constitutes a series of failures, more times than not, I still manage to rise above hell; so, in this sense, these series of relative failures incrementally build toward success. 

Another thing I've noticed is just how similar this aforementioned concept is to making art. I am a painter, and I find painting to be just like this; it is a series of failures that end in success. Each session I am generally displeased with what I've painted, but, in modifying and layering these failures atop one another, I eventually end up with an image I am satisfied with. I am beginning to realize just how similar life is to art- that one's life really is like an art project of the most dramatic, challenging, and profound degree."

Only in the area of ""antisocials""
You should specify the actual diagnosis: antisocial personality disorder (there is a difference), you know this.

There are more than enough ""antisocial"" people who are not aggressive/violent
Even those who, like myself, are misanthropes.

You are putting out the idea that all (men mostly) who prefer to be alone, are likely to be dangerous.
Thus, you are spreading this inaccurate assumption to groups of people, as well as along ""social"" media.

It would be nice to see you restructure this topic.
I mean, it is not so much that this is ""misinformation"", rather more that it is delivered in a way/context, where it can be easily misunderstood.

They don't have enough information because it isn't taught to them by anyone.  So as far as I'm concerned there are no disagreeable people in the whole world.  True, criminals might be low in conscientiousness and low in agreeableness, and might gravitate towards political life as a result, but it can be argued that those people are the most agreeable people after all because they just obey whatever money chases.  They simply replaced people with money in terms of what they trust.  On the other hand, if we replaced money at the heart of our basis for trust in the world, we would see ""disagreeable"" people change their tune in a hurry.  We could do that by replacing the monetary basis with a chain of personal trust, demanding that each person have a personal contact with whom they wished to enter into a mutually trustworthy relationship with - linking every person to the top of the social hierarchy.   We should be able to realize that there are more productive motives than profit, and JP even admits that this is true for young men in general, however he quickly proceeds to contradict himself by stating that there's only one alternative to not playing the money game, and that's rotting to death by doing nothing.

Politically aspect.
------------
A light government that value the individual is democratic, the rest are socialist.

PC liberalism is an oxymoron, since can't be exist liberalism under the PC ideology (1).

If you open the border of the State you known exactly what happen for several reasons as:
- incompatible culture with the hosted Nations
- benefits without productivity and without time limit
- etc.
Welfare (beside bureaucracy), the source of all evil,  despite the fatal attraction that promote. 

---------------
Aggressiveness.
On children is just a primordial instinctive response to define a hierarchy.
A children must be educate to convey his energies on a manner compatible with a civil society.

---------------
The major difference between a civil democratic society and a don't liberal one is the lack of freedom of speech. 
The speech is an instrument used as substitute for the violence between individuals, so a speech can be harsh, don't respectful, etc..Now if you want an higher probabilities to change other opinions is better use a polite form, nothing more, nothing less.
Exist other points but perhaps I speak later about that.

1) When you impose (as legislation, rules, etc) how you must speak and later on which argument can be touched, you use the violence of the State, so you no longer live in a democratic society and you have no more freedom of speech."

Maybe its because I had a disagreement with other people about the passions I have with my stuff, like making music, videos, drawing pictures, and more, and feeling like maybe I'm just not as good as I am, and trying to argue about these things to prove I am, but ultimately making it worse, I have zero clue why, and maybe I'm over thinking this, but honestly, I feel like these first 9 minutes are so me, and for some reason it makes me sad.

Makes me more sad because I'm not even a woman, I am a male, maybe its because I have a higher amount of estrogen in me (I have natural man-boobs that are pretty notable tbh, so that's why I say that) than most males, I'm not sure.

Maybe its because I have aspergers?  I am still not sure, or maybe I'm just over thinking it, I really don't know, but whatever the reason, this video is striking a cord with me, and while I'm still crying, and probably will cry some more once I watch more, I thank you for making this video.

The only thing that differs is that they allegedly do not wish to see borders towards Chaos at large, but in truth they set them up in the small: Their safe spaces are nothing but artificial paradises supposed to keep the unwanted threats of their perception out, while also setting up their own classically chauvinistic borders towards their chosen combinations of superficial traits to be inferior to all the rest of humanity as they define it.

True an untrained woman flailing her arms around probably isn't going to do much damage to a man of about the same fitness relative to his gender. But even a child can give a full-grown man a deadly kick to the balls. Striking with proper form, and having the intent to harm the other person is key. I think the reason why women hitting their husbands are less likely to cause them harm is because they are not punching them with the full intent to seriously injure them in a vital area. And here you could say that agreeableness contributes to the lack of intent to harm. On the other hand, agreeableness can also contribute to an overwhelming determination to harm, in the defense of family. I bet there are situations in which women defending their children have killed career criminals with their bare hands."

My girlfriend happens to be very high on agreeableness.  It's a major theme in our relationship that ""the wolf needs to try not to accidentally hurt the lamb"".

I'm extremely disorderly with my home, I always have been. It was kinda beaten into me in elementary school that that was the way to go. Elementary school was so easy that I never did homework, I was actually reprimanded for making the amount I was comfortable with, which for math and native language class were the whole books the first day. I didn't need my books most of the time because in my home elementary school knowledge was common knowledge. I pretty much did what I wanted in school and had my own projects at home. As such I never really learned to form a schedule and stick to it. 

Now I've got a depression because of Asperger's Syndrome. I fight against my weakness of poor social skills and it takes a toll, but it's hard not to do it. All this makes my bad habits shine through even more, it's hard to find the extra energy to deal with something ""I don't notice, something that doesn't bother me""(48:06).. Living in an extremely messy home is counter-intuitive to what I want though(social equality between me and peers), so maybe I should pay more attention. Would love some advise on how to give a damn about it.

I'm not exaggerating about school and how it affected me. I've had my IQ tested and I'm north of 150, the only area the doctors and guys at Mensa could discern I'm even near average is the social intellect and that's a tad lower than average. Just like a psychopath you can meet me on the street and I can pretend to be normal, but get to know me and you'll see that I'm different, in good and bad ways. Like deliberately betraying someone's trust is a foreign concept for me, I've just never done it.

I felt compelled to write this comment to thank you. You came to my attention, like many others, through your free speech battles, but this series and your other philosophical work has given me profound insight into my psyche and given me tools and ideas to work on for my own betterment.

While I'm grateful for this, what I really grateful for is giving me the framework to help someone else, someone who I care very deeply about and love very much, my partner. She has suffered with depression since she was in her mid teens and had a quite turbulent child hood. In the past when she would have a bad time or hit a low point I could be there for her as at best a comfort, which of course has value, but thanks to the lessons I have learned from your lectures I have been able to talk to her about her feelings. We did what you advocate and spoke the truth and see what happened. 

What happened was we had an intense but deeply gratifying conversation. One that didn't just sooth her, but one I think will help her grow, and in that process I felt I have grown and our relationship has become stronger.

She will be seeing a counsellor soon but I walked her through the big 5 attributes and suggested some actions from the past authoring suite and she took to the ideas really well. She has a lot of baggage from her past, so facing these will be tough, but she saw the value in doing it.

So I wanted to thank you for giving me the tools to sort myself out, but also help my partner sort herself out."

Interesting how science is bearing out what was earlier repudiated as merely ""imposed by religious authority"" as based in quantifiable truths of human behavior.

UgibdK6-hR1R5HgCoAEC,Michael Froelich,1504485300171,"I'm highly empathetic but when I perceive wickedness I never shrink from conflict.   I would not harm or kill an animal because I'm always wishing it well and hoping it's contented.   But if I perceive someone as monsterously wicked I have no problem imposing terrible punishments on them which I perceive they deserve.   And I'm thinking about their malice and cruelty to others, such as the animals I feel for, when I'm torturing them.  Therefore  I'm not sure the framework here comports with my experiences or observations.    I think the problem lies in grounding traits in evolutionary biological terms.    I think the development of personality isn't determined by evolutionary factors.    Humans exist on a different level of consciousness than animals, truly.   For example, I know a lot of women indifferent to others, including their own children.   I think if females show up as more agreeable on tests it's because of their need for acceptance.   Females will become fractured psychologically if they feel unworthy or not accepted.    Their agreeableness isn't empathy, but a strategy for finding acceptance by not wanting to stick out.   Young girls who are gifted and therefore different will hide their giftedness and exceptionalism so they will fit in and not be resented by others.    Boys would never do that.   Neither do boys starve themselves because they perceive their bodies as unattractively fat, or misperceive themselves as fat when they are not fat.    These are not founded in evolution but in the independence vs. dependence variation, with girls being completely dependent on their peers for emotional contentment whereas some boys want to be independent and stand out from others as exceptional.   As well there's confusion here about the traits of criminals.    Among professional criminals and those in prison there is wide variation.    There are predatory personalities and also empathetic personalities.     The most successful criminals are those who care about the well being of others, and therefore gain a reputation for honesty and fairness.     Only the born to lose idiots who never succeed at crime are the ones Peterson is describing here.     That applies only to the criminal world, which is actually a community.    On the other hand sociopaths who cheat everyone they encounter do not live in any community, but in large cities or they travel from place to place cheating everyone they meet.    Those are the people who cannot thrive in the underworld, and in the underworld those kinds of predatory individuals are loathed.    If Peterson understood criminality better he would view it as the economic and financial system it is rather than as an antisocial phenomenon.     Criminals are people seeking to find money.     And one last big thing.    Peterson's observations about the importance of socialization among peers for young children only applies to this culture, where children are thrown together in class rooms.    That is a very recent phenomena.    Until a hundred years or so ago children were not in groups of other children.    Children used to be socialized into their family or community in which their age group peers were not the determining factor.    Peterson's description of this purely recent, and frankly strange, way of treating children as a basic human condition is way off the mark.     I think the truth is that children were never intended to be socialized with their own peer group, and doing so has created these stresses and issues only recently.     Children should not be permitted to form their own cultures apart from that of their adult communities."

what common purpose can aggrable people work towards when they see their peers and mostly themselves as children, being acted upon with no agency
, now if you define cooperation as non conflicting then perhaps but, that's not cooperation

if cooperation is working towards a common goal i don't think agreeable people will beat disagreeable people at that game..... for example soldiers, police, company directors and such staff even scientists perhaps

well the thing is the more competitive you are the more cooperative you are, to compete you have to cooperate

Moreover men are much more cooperative (by the definition of working towards a common goal) than women, well there could be other explanations for that, but the highest difference in trait aggreablness is among gender would support that the higher disaggrablness is more cooperation

UgwAzys6zM9I1WyiaIt4AaABAg,JarrodDSchneider,1504485316110,"A kind of beautiful irony has emerged during my own implementation of some of Peterson's self-authoring ideas. Each morning I ask myself what things I don't want to do but need to do in order to solve the myriad problems I have brought upon myself; taking this into account, I then write down my vision of heaven and hell for the day. Heaven is the sense of utmost accomplishment I would have were I to optimally address my problems. Hell is the complete abandonment of my goals and the backslide into depression and anxiety that would occur as a result. The thing is, I always fall short of heaven- I always fail to optimally remedy my problems to the height of my own satisfaction, and yet I still manage to slightly progress and climb a little more out of the hole I have dug for myself. Although this technically constitutes a series of failures, more times than not, I still manage to rise above hell; so, in this sense, these series of relative failures incrementally build toward success. 

Another thing I've noticed is just how similar this aforementioned concept is to making art. I am a painter, and I find painting to be just like this; it is a series of failures that end in success. Each session I am generally displeased with what I've painted, but, in modifying and layering these failures atop one another, I eventually end up with an image I am satisfied with. I am beginning to realize just how similar life is to art- that one's life really is like an art project of the most dramatic, challenging, and profound degree."

One question:  I've heard Dr. Peterson state that the human gestation period should be 2 years based on similarly sized animals.  Does anyone have the source for this?  From what I can find, we're on par with other animals of our size.

For example:
Chimp gestation: 240 days
Cow: 286 days
Gorillia: 257 days
Human: 270 days

You are confusing the gestation period that were required if human babies were born with the same relative brain size as other primates as compared to their adult brain size with the median gestation period of middle of the road mammals.

That lead to them being extinct as they didnt realize that inside of them (chancellor palpatine) was the true enemy. Then the hero who is Luke Skywalker faces Vader, the pure evil in Episode V and loses as he too was too naive. He then completes his Jedi training in Episode VI where Yoda tells him he has to face Vader to become a true Jedi and a devine hero. In the final fight he then faces the evil inside himself as there is darkness in him, as a part of Vader also lives in Luke because he is his father.

At the point of the snow cone is the ""origins of life"" which after over fifty years they do not have a mechanism for a self-replicating protein.  The canning industry puts all the parts into a can billions of times a year and depends on neo-biogenesis not occurring.  Information science shows that DNA can only degrade.  Currently, we are in the sixth extinction crisis that of large animals such as the lion, cheetah, and giraffe.  Extinction crises are not predicted by the evolutionary theory but rather more and more new species.  Creation is an upside down snow cone which is devolving through entropy to the extinction of the biosphere just as we are seeing.

Ugy7OJ4cdtWXBz4Y5Ax4AaABAg,Integral Stanley,1530663985100,"I have been loving taking this course and wanted to share my notes in case anyone was interested.  Jordan tells us that a central scientific question is “What is the universe made of?”. He expresses that a more meaningful question is “How should I best live my life?”  He explains that for thousands of years myths have existed and been accepted because they help us answer important questions like the second question above. He believes that myths continue to be very important for modern, postmodern, and integral persons. To support his belief he tells us that millions of people have waited in long lines to view myths expressed through movies such as Star Wars. On the other hand few people tend to wait in long lines to listen to a scientific talk. 
 One topic of myth is when a person looks back and is turned into stone. This is the story of people who do not move forward with their lives and instead get stuck on something that has happened to them in the past. 
 Another topic of myth is the Phoenix rising. This is a story of how people can overcome difficult circumstances and move forward to live beautiful lives.
 Another topic of myth is the hero’s journey. Many myths have been told of a person traveling to far off and adventurous lands to bring back great treasures for the benefit of their society. A job of education is to give students the hope that they can live meaningful and adventurous lives and contribute beautifully to their societies. He gives us the sobering data that fully one third of the students at the University of Toronto are so depressed that they qualify to be hospitalized. This is probably typical for most universities in the Western world. Education needs to realize and help with this situation.  Jordan believes the great antidote is the hope of living a meaningful and worthwhile life."

UgzK0vDfQycUE_srk754AaABAg,Chandula Seneviratne,1525393596171,"Lecture 2/3 - Historical and Mythological Context
• Our facial expression guide behaviour to a degree
  e.g. disgusted face/s suggest that the current behaviour should change

• Our society has metaphysical ideas 
 - Certain natural laws - e.g. US Constitution
 - Promotes sovereignty about individual - certain dignity/respect to person no matter what they do
 -  Maybe our society will work better this way?

• Implicit morality
 - People you don't like - characteristic you dont like and likely dont want
 - People you like - characteristic you like and likely want

• You notice corruption in the world
 - Do you run away and not do anything to change the corruption?

• The Hero Myth
 - Jonah myth (or Lion King lol): happy => something changes => knocked off perch => down in chaos => strengthen character => return as a better you

• Facing and overcoming the monster (e.g. Basilisk in Harry Potter)
 - Pragmatically it means facing our issues, weakness and faults
 - Important as we need to recognise it as a symbol for our savageness or danger
  ○ ""I need to be careful of the things I can do""
 - (slight tangent) reason children as scared of the dark could be a holdover from times when there were dangers in the dark
  ○ Especially snakes
 - Attractive quality irl to opposite sex (particularly to female)

• We learn the most when we make mistakes
 - Learning is almost proportional to how bad you screwed up
 - Changing habit is killing an established neuronal structure
  ○ Extremely difficult and painful (literally and figuratively) 

• Perception is determined by values 
 - e.g. limited scope means we focus on things that are important to use
 - ""attention has its own autonomy""
 - We do not see objects - we see tools or obstacles
  ○ Obstacles can stop your whole journey
 - Objects affect our emotions and utilisation of them
  ○ e.g. patients with prefrontal cortex impairment - when they see an open door they cannot stop themselves from walking through it

• Mythologies show us shared values
 - Tragic self-consciousness
  ○ Search for meaning
  ○ Being engaged in something worthwhile => makes me feel worthwhile
 - We live in a society
  ○ Status and Respect 
  ○ Benevolence and Malevolence in society

• Psychoanalysts believe in different 'parts of yourselves'
 - 'angry self' - almost foreign concept that is so horrifying
  ○ PTSD
 - 'normal self' - regulates emotion
 - Do the different hemisphere have different consciousness?

• Cultural identity can regulate emotions
 - Expectations about what you're supposed to act like
        - Help individual keep emotions in check - to a degree

• Serotonin
 - Tunes your nervous system, 
 - When you are at the top of a dominance hierarchy your serotonin levels rise which means that happy things make you happier 
  ○ sad things make you less sad
 - When your at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy hardly anything makes you happy + everything makes you nervous. 

• To manage anxiety - (recommend at least 3)
 - Need to eat properly
 - Regular schedule
 - Career - get you somewhere on the dominance hierarchy
 - Spouse 
 - Family - parents, children
 - Manage intake of drugs 

• Language - is not necessarily required for social interaction
 - Pre-verbal comprehension of the world
 - Meaning outside of language

• Sexual selection
 - Females are choosy, pick someone higher in dominance hierarchy
 - Preference for creative men
 - Dominance hierarchy can act as selective mechanism
 - Nature is what selects = probably why it's Mother nature

• Social cognitive filter
 - Children personify inanimate objects => helps understand your world
  ○ e.g. animations
 - Because they live in a social world

• Major intellectual battle
 - Traditional - suggests that we have a nature, more based in nature and history (?)
  ○ Cultures we set up must match our basic nature
 - Postmodernist - blank slate, any aspect of us can be changed
  ○ Social construction utopian - human beings are infinitely malleable, changes to society will lead to perfect society"

It was easier for me to overcome become my family is basically 100% sober with the exception of a small amount of alcohol on the holidays. Making new friends and cutting old friends off is the challenge because I had roughly the same group of them for around 8-9 years. It really does become a way of life, not just an addiction to a substance. That's why AA focuses on a ""spiritual awakening and psychic change"" because you need a new way of life. I do not like the AA program or NA program very much but they do have that part of it right 100%."

UgwIwHgiprF1f5MxxOJ4AaABAg,Rafael Ramos,1515025613043,"I think Peterson makes a fundamental mistake when he proceeds to say that ""you can't act without a morality"". Not all of our actions are based on morality or have moral implications. If we consider, for example, a perfectly moral community, in which all evil is taken away, there are still judgements to be made upon a wide variety of circumstances: facing the death of a loved one or the choice of an occupation are profound human problems which have nothing to do with morality."
UgyeLAPBZMZedK0b88F4AaABAg,Eric Hiatt,1515025613063,"The idea that there's ""only"" general intelligence doesn't make a lot of sense, even though the various multiple intelligence theories are perhaps off base. Do this thought experiment: Imagine the set of all possible environments and all possible brains (you can extend this to all possible brains in any organism, alien or otherwise). Expose these brains to all possible developmental contingencies (e.g. all possible educations). So one brain gets to develop in every way possible in all possible environments. And keep in mind that environments are dynamic, so it's an exposure to all possible environments over time. Also consider that a given brain is competing/cooperating will all other brains undergoing the same conditions. This is an absurdly large space, but it ""exists.""

A given mind is going to be more or less successful in a particular subset of these realities, and the success is going to be determined by biological differences, neurological differences, a vast array of cultural and environmental differences, etc. 

Consider that creativity, for example, is relatively rare. In some environments creativity will get you thrown in a labor camp, while in others it will get you awards. Do we say that a person is lacking general intelligence when they express their creativity and are jailed because they didn't adapt to that environment? There are clearly differences in brains and differences in environment. Where is the general intelligence here? And some survival strategies, like going along with a brutal dictatorship, are suicide to the species as a whole in the long run. Is the general intelligence the one that will sacrifice our future for its own survival while the artist might take a risk?

And we also have proof that humans are dumber than chimps given the tyrants that humans choose, organized crime gangs, etc. Our ""intelligence"" has been used to amplify and secure dominance traits that can be kept in better balance by ""less intelligent"" animals.

The United States has more than 1000 military bases worldwide and has a history of overthrowing socialist/communist countries and installing brutal dictators. This is to protect capitalism (curiously - a long-term suicidal economic strategy). This is tyrannical behavior Peterson claims we don't engage in as human beings. Then we tell the wrong story from the comfort of our violence-procured-resource shelters. Many tyrants are simply beyond reach - so the strategy works just fine. Countries like the United States have indeed created Hell on Earth - several places and throughout time. So have many other countries.

Tinkerbell is a good metaphor for capitalism - with modifications. You never get to live in harmony with your home - Earth. You never grow up. So you wed a ghost who will turn you into one.

Culture kills other cultures. It's just a higher-order evolutionary structure. It keeps you alive the same as a spear - which is a tool of an evolutionary arms race. Humans are innately xenophobic."

Jonah was already going down into the depths of the sea destined to drown and die when the whale rescued him. If you let the Jonah story stand on it's own merits it is quite clearly a story of the mercy of God.

This female has also an increased value because of being a virgin, she has no history of sleeping with others and therefore has a relative higher value when you sleep with to produce offspring.

- about mythological universally known stories:
        - a. why it is comprehensible
        - b. why it is enjoyable 
        - c. what exactly are you doing

- cultures use music to organise themselves, to catalyse their identities 
- in archaic societies, rituals use music and dance as symbolic representations of a mode of being in the world (ex. animals, leader, family, nature, etc.)

- HOW SHOULD ONE CONDUCT ONESELF IN THE WORLD?

- axioms of faith …society is supported on philosophical foundations, metaphysical ideas, these are manifested in stories and myths 
        - the individual has transcendent worth, fundamental axiom from which the human rights in western civilisation is derived “we hold theses truths to be self evident”

- mythical underworld (unknown/chaos) …place where you go when things fall apart, when an axiom with which you conduct your life, disappears/gets destroyed/fails/etc. The worst case scenario you can find yourself in is when you are playing a causal role in the “falling apart” of the axiom, this is specially hard to define.

- road to health …from a psychoanalyst perspective is that if you are not doing well, which means that the combination of your presuppositions and your actions translated as habits are not matching with how the world is responding. Then finding whats wrong with your presuppositions/action patterns and so why are they not producing the desirable outcome is what might get you out of the underworld.
        - ej. maybe your are not moving forward because of fear, maybe that fear is grounded in terrible experiences from the past that you were never able to understand.
        - what are you avoiding? from fear? disgust? 

- we are nested inside a dream cause we can’t know everything, we have to take things as givens and those things are nested inside stories, we accept the stories as valid, and then outside the stories is the absolute unknown. 

- to punish the virtues …is a central archetypical story found in christianity, for example, in which Christ is punished in the worst possible way for the highest posible virtues, thats why its archetypical there is nothing more unfair than that, its a sort of limit.  

- Because life is so difficult you have to do something that is truly worthwhile, in order to justify it. You have a ethical duty to straighten things up.

- respect for yourself …you cannot have proper respect for yourself until you know you are a monster, because you won’t act carefully enough. The harm you do to people can come in many ways. Understand your shadow.

- Jung believed that inside the shadow was the anima. It relates to the preference of the women for dangerous but tamed males.

- learning …finding out something that you do wrong, something thats build into you like a character, presumption of your perception, or a deep habit, killing it, killing that part of your personality, suffering for it as you correct it, and become a new version of yourself. the phoenix.

- mental disorders …these are not illnesses that have specific limits on the mind and life of the subject, they are usually embedded through out all across the individual’s life’s, so you can’t actually “clinically” remove it sort to speak.

- categorization …one of the problems that come across clinical psychology or psychiatry as a science is that their categories are actually quite diverse, the problem is big because if the categories aren’t homogeneous then its very difficult to draw a conclusion about the members of the category.

- perception …your value system determines the direction of your perception…you live within a framework of perception thats determined by your values because you look at what you want, you aim at what you want and once you aim the world lays itself out to you, and thats how perception works.
        - your value system is configured by mostly unconscious forces that you have little control over and determines your attention and focus.
        - The Ecological Approach To Visual Perception (James J. Gibson) …when people took at the world they see value first and inferred object second.

- truth …there is not one way of defining truth thats appropriate, the definition of truth might be more like a tool, and as tool using creatures really what we are trying to do with our conceptions of truth is to work trough the world, successfully. The darwinian idea of truth is that our notions about the world have evolved trough a darwinian process and that its appropriate for us to regard as what is most real those things that reliably ensure the continuation of our lives and the probability of propagation.

- archetype/to be human is to participate in a certain pattern of being …that pattern is acted out socially, individually and is also part of your structure, even your perceptual structure as a living organism of your particular type.

- culture …set of value laden presuppositions that you orient yourself in the world that MATCH the set of value laden presuppositions that everyone in your culture has and acts out. Is that match that regulate your emotions, is not the belief system, is the match/cultural identity. 

- serotonin …it tunes your nervous system, when you are at the top of a dominance hierarchy your serotonin levels rise which means that happy things make you happier and sad things make you less sad, so if your at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy hardly anything makes you happy, and everything makes you nervous. 

- society …the societal structure, which is an elaborate dominance hierarchy, regulates your emotions because the match of your expectations and the behaviours of the people within that structure, and your position within that hierarchy regulates the ratio and intensity of your positive and negative emotions 

- falling into chaos …it is not just anxiety, when you fall into chaos, you fall into a state where nothing is certain, the way you construe the world isn’t certain and even the way the world is isn’t certain because you don’t know how to act or your actions aren’t working and so the world is presenting itself as something that is chaotic, is not just psychological, the chaos is a weird intermingling of the chaotic world (“real” chaos) and the chaotic self (psychological chaos), those two things con spiral  …the distinction between the psyche and the world is quite arbitrary.
        - ej. a person gets fired, this is devastating, this is falling into chaos, psychological speaking you are disrupted and realistically speaking the person is unemployed that makes the world far more incomprehensible and uncertain.
        - Thomas Szasz - The Myth Of Mental Illness …most people have problems in living, not psychological problems 

- dimensions to live well …operating reasonable well in at least half of these dimensions will psychologically thrive you, motivate you.
        - schedule
        - plan 
        - career
        - productive time 
        - regulate use of drugs
        - family

- language …there is a meaning network outside of language, and its what language is grounded in and that is this pre verbal comprehension of the world, its an embodied comprehension of the world. 

- environment/social cognitive architecture …your environment is not nature, is culture, is other people. Your fundamental architecture is social cognitive, you tend to view the world as if it is personified. This is specially because the world in which you emerged as a being was primarily social, what you needed to know is “who is the big primate? who is the little primate? who is related to who?”.
        - ej. if a big chimp bullies a little chimp he can tear him apart. but if the little chimp is associated with bigger chimps, the little chimp can bully the big chimp, big chimp won’t mess with him. This is because the nervous system of he big chimp doesn’t respond to the little chimp as just little, but a little chimp attached to some big monsters. 
        - The nervous system responds to the network around the chimp. This is a kind of platform that constitutes the evolutionary underpinnings of your psyche. This means we actually dont care too much about what our “world/nature” looks like, but the relationships between beings, the social cognitive architecture. 

- super ego …internalised representation of the judgemental father, society.

- you can’t use science as a guide of behaviour, you use instinct manifested in imagination and the evolved structure of your organic culture (dominance hierarchy/emotions/feelings) 

- universals … social world, natural world, the individual 
               culture, nature           , you
          the known, the unknown, you
           father, mother         , you"

How could abstractions and complex thought structures become apparent to an individual before he could articulate them to himself? You, an Carl Jung, have showed me the answer (I don't have to explain to you how). Consciousness, and a more and more nuanced and sophisticated picture of the world, developed over time as we distilled our language and myth structures into concrete truths. 

I am attending Cornell next year, and I would love to go up to Toronto and meet you. I believe we think in similar ways, and ask ourselves the same fundamental questions.

Kids should not be used to get your life back on track, because it's just gonna add more problems and stress to your life and if you fail now you not only affect yourself."

UgiqPrGbhOuzJHgCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504484926648,"Jesus of Nazareth takes particular aim at those who would make the contents of scripture out to be beneficial fables to communicate virtues.

Matthew 22:29-32 
The same day came to him the SADDUCEESS, WHICH SAY THERE IS NO RESURRECTION, and asked him,
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Jesus answered and said unto them, YE DO ERR, NOT KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES, NOR THE POWER OF GOD.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

Whether one believes that the Bible is literal or not is up to the reader to decide for himself.  However it is very clear that the Bible wants you to take it at face value.  It wants a flesh and blood comprehension.  The incarnate Word is warning those who would scoff at the power of God.  Is the potency of the Godhead simply a series of cryptic lessons about values?  The Christ presents the ""intellectual approach"" as ignorance, even a form of dread.  He warns about this type of person and this type of interpretation as a form of fleeing.


John 3:3-4
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

Nicodemus is playing a game.  He knows God is not telling him to reenter his mother's womb.  However instead of confronting an otherworldly reality, he would rather shrink back into an all to human frame of reference.  He would rather cling to a template of absurd materialism rather than embrace the sweeping take over of spiritual reality which is turns materialism on it's head.  Sell all your worldly possessions and follow God.  This is absurd to the carnal minded. Why would you give away your power?  I am not saying Jesus was not serious when he commanded the rich young ruler and his disciples to divest themselves of earth's wealth.  However the bigger focus was to leave earth behind for the new kingdom.   God is moving the center focus of your reality from the earth to heaven, from substance to spirit.  The earth is not real power, barely a real place,  that is why the devil rules over it.  That is why the is friendship with the world is enmity with God. 

 Romans 8:7 
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  

Carnality is not just sex, food, drink, and revelry.  Carnality is a mindset that says I have a way of seeing and connecting to the world and I will hold to it even if it gets disturbed by an outside influence.  I will explain it away.  If many people see something supernatural, what do we say of it?  Mass hallucination!  That does not exist.  Any clear thinking person knows that you can not share a hallucination.  You can share an ILLUSION with a common point of scrutiny (refraction of light particles) like a rainbow, but not a completely self generated hallucination.  Why do we make up obviously false explanations?  Easy, to keep our old paradigms, to keep our old wine bottles, and our old garments.  The new wine and the new cloth that threatens to rent and burst the old are figments of our imagination or witty literary devices helping us understand and appreciate the old.  Never replacements for the old.  Listen to Jesus lay into Nicodemus. 

John 3:12 
If I have told you EARTHLY THINGS, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of HEAVENLY THINGS?

Mythologizing the real exploits of God is a clever way of running from God and his kingdom.  The main point of the book of Jonah is that no one deserves mercy so there is no point in devising a standard by which to administer it, just give it. The second minor point (my point) of Jonah and the wale is to take God seriously.  Jonah did not run from God because he did not take him seriously.  He ran from God because HE DID and did not want Nineveh to take God seriously, WHICH THEY DID!  The power of God can only be realized when you take it seriously.  Why did the sailors throw Jonah overboard?  They took God seriously when the lot fell on Jonah.  They did not symbolically throw him overboard by verbally chastising him, they threw him overboard literally to quell a literal storm."

The universal deception and cheating in the realm of so-called moral improvement.— We do not believe that a man will become another if he is not that other already; i.e., if he is not, as is often the case, a multiplicity of persons, at least the embryos of persons. In this case, one can bring a different role into the foreground and draw ""the former man"" back— The aspect is changed, not the essence— That someone ceases to perform certain actions is a mere fatum brutum[232] that permits the most various interpretations. It is not always the case that the habit of a certain act is broken, the ultimate reason for it removed. He who is a criminal through fate and facility unlearns nothing, but learns more and more: and a long abstinence even acts as a tonic to his talent— For society, to be sure, all that is of interest is precisely that someone no longer performs certain actions: to this end it removes him from those conditions in which he can perform certain actions; that is wiser, in any event, than to attempt the impossible, namely, to disrupt the fatality by which he is thus and thus. The church— and in this it has done nothing but succeed and inherit from the philosophy of antiquity—proceeding from a different standard and desiring to save a ""soul,"" the ""eternal destiny"" of a soul, first believes in the expiatory power of punishment and then in the obliterating power of forgiveness: both are deceptions of religious prejudice—punishment does not expiate, forgiveness does not extinguish, what is done is not undone. That someone forgets something is certainly not evidence that something has ceased to exist—■ A deed produces its consequences, within the man and outside the man, regardless of whether it is considered as punished, ""expiated."" ""forgiven"" and ""extinguished,"" regardless of whether the church has in the meantime promoted the doer to a saint. The church believes in things that do not exist, in ""souls;"" it believes in effects that do not exist, in divine effects; it believes in states that do not exist, in sin, in redemption, in the salvation of the soul: it stays everywhere on the surface, at signs, gestures, words to which it gives an arbitrary meaning. It possesses a thoroughly thought-out method of psychological counterfeiting."

It is absolutely true that there are no operations that you can perform on descriptive premises in formal logic to derive a proscriptive conclusion. People tend to use this in the vernacular to say that descriptions can't translate to ethics, which isn't really true as real-life moral decisions tend to be constraint-satisfaction operations rather than derivations: we tend to start with declarative constraints that connect in such a way that ""ought"" statements are auggested (and often we come up with more than one option).

But what’s the underlying motivation for an idea like that to manifest within me? What am I compensating for? What in the world am I ignoring? 

Perhaps, my comment was aimed at cutting my ideal at the knees, because why not? My ideal is to be like Jordan, but I clearly have a lot of work to do. 

if we use Jordan’s definition of truth pragmatic in the sense that the intention of action in relation to my ideal is the marker of its truthfulness, then my commentary about Jordan is contradictory with my highest ideal 

So now I should stop myself from identifying with those types of thoughts and reframe them: 

Jordan’s has been able to notice and articulate the deepest patterns of human behavior, and has developed a following not just as a result of self affirimation and hunger for power, but with the intention to help others manifest the ideal of God within us.

After consuming every lecture (2 per day rewinding when needed to help my understandings develop) on Maps and Meaning as If I had a tyrannical father (in fact any father at all would have done i guess hahaha) who had paid for that education I then moved onto this series, thank you wholehearted Professor Peterson I could never have dreamed of getting my hands on this level of education from my upbringing or young adult life, it's all mind blowing but in a very good way. 

Which lectures or resources would you recommend next? I am currently reading Jung, The Modern Man in Search of a Soul and Orwell's, The Road to Wigan Pier, when i get my head somewhat around these I will be focusing on your book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos which i just ordered online yesterday, thanks again.

“Be what you can be. God, you let the world around you dissolve otherwise. That’s not a good thing. You got something that everyone needs man, including yourself. That’s why, let it out, that’s where everything you want is. It’s the case for every single one of you. So, hoist up your goddamn privilege and go out there and do something in the world.”"

My partner and I decided to try our best to be the ""useful"" people, who helped him and his family throughout the entire process from his illness, to his passing and funeral etc.. 

As an unexpected benefit: It has helped US in the healing process, to be actively involved in the event and it has helped me say goodbye and grieve fully while honoring the loss of a great mentor and friend. We have also formed much closer relationships with mutual friends and his family.

If I could sum up my thoughts to the solutions for our current political dilemmas in a simple phrase, it would be:

Think like an architect, not like a partisan.

Architecture might be abstracted to using the interplay of opposing forces to create stable, beautiful, and useful structures. Consider how your partisan interests REQUIRE an opposition in order to create stability. Reflection on the work of the US Constitutional Convention might help us to see that the vision embraced was grander than that of a winning party. It was about a larger vision of using the interplay of opposing forces in order to create a dynamic and stable system that we can all live in, a system that was able to survive through a self correction on one of the oldest scourges of humanity..... slavery, which WAS NO SMALL FEAT! As I see it, THIS is the level we should aspire to. To create something we can be proud to bestow to humanity for future generations. A gift to the future."

Avoid psychology like you would avoid the Inquisition. 

This man is a sociopath.

Tho whole point of psyche and human heritage is to enjoy the ability or necessity to grow and change (which are analogous or isomporphic processes) while and even by maintaining and enjoying a persistent and consistent orientation to all the psychological as biological organs of communication (family and self-identity, the symbiotic trinity of truth, sense and relationship to one's whole environment), any failure or corruption of which leads to the evident compulsion to sacrifice who one is (or was born as - the Word or any language or science worthy of the name - made flesh) for who one ""could be.""

Such is the corrupting premise (the latter) of the primary artifact of cultural genocide insinuated into and thus gaining the collusion-with-plausible-impunity of every constituent human organ and family of a cybernetic-industrial society - fucking Xianity.

Sense and magic on the far horizon hand-to-mouth
Inimitable vittles the fulfillment every breath
An understanding that enjoys the pictures that abound

In the old days of the 1900s and 1800s a teacher had to be someone who was actually good at, well, teaching.
It wasn't a slip of paper or a degree that made a teacher it was their ability to excite people's minds and make them think.
Today, through ""management"" and ""administration"" we've made sure that those people who are best able to regurgitate become teachers.  This is why the university system is, in a word, failing.

Maybe in some small way what Peterson is doing will lead to a new kind of teaching, one where people learn the contents of courses for free through videos and then go to these schools to take the exams and tests to find if they know the course content. By making schools a geographical solution, we make sure that getting into the good schools is a question of luck and not of ability or aptitude.  Being born to the right parents in the right geographical area and being lucky enough to enjoy the things that the local renowned schools focus on is a poor way to maximize the productivity of any given population.

The morality of Social Justice is a morality of guilt, where the best you can hope for - if you’re part of the privileged groups - is to be harmless.  To get out of the way of the oppressed people.  To be a good ally.  What a contrast this is to the call to be a hero! To make yourself into a strong, upright, powerful force for good. Knowing your capacity to do horrible things, yet choosing to turn that strength to the good - the good of everyone. Choosing to tell the truth and having faith that the consequences will be the best that they possibly could be. What an exciting story to live. To quote The Dark Tower: ""Remember the Face of your Father"". Thanks, Professor Peterson."

So JBP always mentions people high in neuroticism in a context that they are anxious or depressed most of the time, or react to certain situations inadequately. Soooo, does it mean that ppl that are high in trait neuroticism were just unlucky to be born high in this trait and doomed to suffer more than those who score low on this specific trait?! Can people high in neuroticism shift this trait closer to the balance or being even low on neuroticism?

UghKyBEFkhm9d3gCoAEC,Southern Israelite,1504485072944,"American Patriotism is Anarchist Atheism; You Cannot believe in Jesus and Libertarianism.

1.Subjective Value is nihilistic, makes man God and denies the authority of the Bible.

2. Libertarianism promotes a laissez-faire policy of the state toward the market. The principle of opportunity cost precludes the idea of neutrality. There is no neutrality in this world. You are either with or against. Mat. 12: 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

3. Hierarchy and Authority is grounded in the family. Every argument Libertarians make against Statism and Slavery can all equally apply to the human family. Moreover, there is a Government among the unfallen angels in Scripture. Government is not a result of sin.

4. Both Biology(Haplogroups) and Scripture(Rom. 9:1-3, Rom. 11[Jews, Gentiles]) denotes
collective identities not merely individuals.

5. Capitalism is Darwinism pace Darwin’s emphasis on Competition which he alludes to in Origen of Species in discussion of Herbert Spencer.

6. Ayn Rand was an Inspiration to the Church of Satan:
http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php

7. The Libertarian distinction between Ethics and Economics is meaningless.

8. Private Property just means Individual Sovereignty/Satanism; Judges 17:5 every man did what was right in his own eyes.

9. The Bible’s prohibition against Usury is a prima facie denial of the entire system of Capitalism and the modern Banking industry. John Calvin’s distinction between Business loans and charity is refuted by Neh. 5.

10. Since the Bible forbids usury it ipso facto forbids the Gold Standard

11. The rich are generally demonized as immoral people in the Bible. Mark 10:25 “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

12. Free Trade is a method used by the Satanic rich to make money for themselves at the expense of their countrymen’s poverty and misery.

13. The Economic consequences of letting people do what they want are disastrous in the light of comparative advantage and opportunity cost. The financial and physical strength of our people is wasted on their atheist and nihilistic pursuits such as sports, abortions, STDs, degenerate entertainment etc.

14. Libertarian Christians say sins are not crimes necessarily. They will say the sin is a crime only if the OT law demands a penalty, but then they turn around and say the penalties are ceremonial: i.e. Jubilee-remittance of debt, is ceremonial. They use sophistry to make the law powerless and meaningless. Disgusting!

15. The US Constitution is betrayal to the Protestant Solemn League and Covenant, and is Satanic and Counter Reformation. Article 6 clause 3 of the US Constitution:

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.”

16. Communists are not Darwinists; they are Pantheistic Buddhist Mystics."

I have a BSc degree in audio engineering, but unfortunately i was too stupid to utilize the school and university studying for my actual education, not to say that that would have been sufficient given that I live in Serbia, and you can imagine the system here. Fortunately I do have the practical know-how in my field, that being music and audio, so I am somewhat useful, but the stuff you talk about just isn't that, is it. Question, if you were 23 years old and for all intents and purposes a half-voluntary half-blind victim of a corrupt, outdated, idiot breeding schooling system, how would you come about filling all the gaps?

I seem stuck on the idea that materialist rationalism can't account for creativity.  I also love the Tao symbol of chaos and order.... I have a notion this is tied directly into the dual hemispheres of our minds and how they influence being while being tied to the animal brain that drives our base motivations. Walking the line between order and chaos is balancing the two sides of our minds. The literal and the emotional, objects and perception, feeling and thought.  We find the bliss of meaning when we are keeping both sides engaged.  A hypothesis for why we enjoy music is that it's structured and rational but it draws on our emotions at the same time.  I think this may be why music helps study, because when your engaging both sides of the mind you are actually using a higher percentage of your minds potential.  This makes facts and understanding them easier to transcribe into memory at the same time.  Can IQ be looked at as a measure of how well you can bring the power of both sides of your mind to a task at the same time.   I'm not sure what is wrong with this idea but I think it feels true."

UggVeE6mM8XcSngCoAEC,Artemirr Lazaris,1504485094648,"Well, I have never attempted to get  a 100% as I find there is no current point as I currently think the system is a exploitive mean, that has been taken over. Peterson is oblivious.

The first course I ever failed, was by a bias, no matter how i wrote it in an english course, she gave me less then 50% on each paper. Then she made her own means of union protection and I even went to the dean,. Out of 22 students 8 dropped out because of her. She had to announce her sexuality every class that I questioned, she had shown work in class that was written poorly as an example. Her A graded paper was littered with errors, I even stated them all. She is measuring by emotion and feeling and not logical and what is of error, so if you write with  an emotion that is objective they or these individual cannot mark correctly. 

SO if your writing for the stupid females that have been proper up by feminist groups, write for the mention and feeling like a script fora movie, pander to their fucking retardation. if its man, well write how you feel and correctly. You get A, and they see to actually make grammar correctly and can associate style outside of grammar. In a formal or non formal. Of course Passing any course is pretty easy. 

If I said what was a determination of my grades, would be the socializing nonsense that was being narrated int the minds fate people and they were masses of idiots following the world politics, of AL gore type people that are predatory and wolves. Of course this is how we are today. 

Now we have masses of people forcing themselves not and destroy my culture that I once belonged too, and they re write and continue pr, against individuals, but thats abroad spectrum. 

I think Peter is way off. 

I have met people that fired me from a job, because I had judgemental eyes. 

I have met women that have judged me by stating, the way I look that I have never had a hard day in life.
I have met people that stated to entire class, look at him, he can get any girl he wants. Now I was 21 at this time and virgin and i didn't really understand what he meant. Most people thought I live under a rock, because they did weird social behaviours narrated by ficiotn as the norm. So these groups and peoples destroy me, so I behave and act like the to merge, but then I am depressed, and these people use and mark money as a success and not the association of works and wealth as actions. instead, large slave factories of people to create shitty products when most can be automated and not exploited, however thats beside the points.

SO I Would say, that the warmonger is creating and making nonsense.

My individual life of my family has been having a microscope at the age of 4-7 and I did many other factors, th entire market is to destroy the human bio-system, and movies or entertainment, has been become, captivate and capture. Which puts all to death, whereas family history german and english, working on atom bombs and speaking many languages, now in this place I have been trapped by divisional politics that are making enemies, but the only enemy I see is these people stealing fro the public purse and the thefts they have acquired form these entities. Community is broken because its forcing us to share with people that do not have the right trials thus forcing death of the entire world. That is what is happening, which is different, when I say death, tis human loos of life that must ha open because of the exploitation. Seriously what did my grandfather fight for? feminism to narrate men are evil? I could go int the money bubble of disreality, but its not true to the actions in which creates. So we have this notion of money and divine in which has been created, rather than it as a natural fact of works and trade, instead we have capital lslavers that use capital to  abuse works and pay unfairly. The education of these abuses are made everywhere, in society. More so, and more. 

Remel and AL Gore. 

Why am I stating this.

Well Remel made a question statement that was taken way outside thermal of reality, and stole money, this has a massive impact on society, thus avarice is a sickening sort. Google, Samsung and many other outlets must be destroyed, Cosco. Individual super wealth over the state is not allowing the creation of the need of works needed for th state, in which we are enslaved too, instead its an abuse and mismanagement and self dictators which put themselves everywhere as an importance, like some hollywood crutch. Its witchcraft of nonsense. Man..
A world f dis-reality, and forced reality of fictional reality. by stating it as a nromalcy or reality, its like borderline bringing back the death penalty, by capital abuse. Ben shapiro psychopathic murderer, as with everyone else. But peace made this is ignored. Its radical groups that took it over. in the 1920 feminism movements fought against the veil. So what does one do, when the works are stolen form a person. What a world.... Information of idiots. Science is or isn't.

I remembe r7th grade science. Were given a hypothesis and we have to prove it. IF we don't prove it (Which was the case) then we must make a real conclusion and hand it it. SO the alb of our science class was to prove what the teacher said, which was impossible, as the tests would give other results. During pipetting. Then we have to come to another conclusion based onto information of what were using, and make statements to agree with. This world of love and understanding and building is removed by greedy idiots. In which state the nonsense of the world. 

Openly stating, exploiting smart peoepl to get rich, you see the upside down notion. Thus then accusing and forcing slavery, who the hell are these christians. Then not allow us to kill them,thats basically the jewish problem hitler was to address by the capital liars and it is totalitairsm . So where do we go? The world of darkness comes running in. Sigh.. reality.. and love smash to bits by greed. All from envy and jealous and liars, just pigs of humans.


So what did I do to myself... Not really sure, other hone only putting in 60-70% effort as I can see in side the mind of cause and affect to 90% plus accuracy when I judge people in my mind, to garner their actions or past actions, and I ask questions that verify but do not reveal my underlying questions, so perception brings answers, even if I am being amicable. What is that, meh I don't know, but asking questions gives one information. Without directly asking the question that would give the answer wanted ,to making the person feel awkward. Me.. The world now.. psyhotechnics,and more crap.. wow what a world of hate... Formed by greed. Funny from everything to nothing and those people keep re writing and lying about history."
UggILSG2jgXY9HgCoAEC,William Koscielniak,1504485094718,"Peterson said that William James and Pragmatism is the only brand of genuine American philosophy.

Craig the owner of Cosco, these entities control and force polices of migration and create a system of ruin, in which if they are removed from the hector, all things collapse, its ancient style of societal narcissism, versus , ensuring the society is not reliable on one person, but one person can add much tho the community, and the laws and structure of our society have been removed. Entertainers are idiots and clowns paid to lie, whilst these marxist entries are taking over and quite blatent. These monopolies also in pursuit, such as fast food chains, are pyramid and against state funding and the classic models of the family sizes are removed and monopolized by unsound minds with the intent in which copies, deploys and by aesthetics and words take over. Thus specialized parties and loyalty nonsense cards are created, this is a classic war schism for divide, This has been ingested by the entire system thus its a beast system in which has taken over aggressively. 

People like al gore, and eco at the Royal Bank and more places, should be removed and re ordered by law and regulations which aims to stop the harm being caused, as to have natural set, instead, open slavery and exploitation form asai is a problem. So if the exploitation continues, it would be in the best interest to kill off all humans theatre being exploited to ensure the survivability of natural autonomy and community, thus these entities na groups will be forced to return. 

Jordans nonsense often relies on his nonsense view of reality, because of what he has been fed, ignores where the products come form, and the original makers made fair wages and the ability of life to flourish, These people make no amends for their crimes and continue to march over all.

The world of liars. 

Look at the actors taking positions in which academics and areas of study were and existed. Look at the democrats and their forced investments by the use of government forcing an global warming narrative, and not allowing a fair use of mind, and played the card for money, undermining the entire culture over here and blleding out our technical wealth to tyrants and idiots. that use capital lt control which benefits the use of banks, thesis s sick state in which they operate. Of course the fat useless pigs, keep supporting and buying the shit, because they don't want to know, as the philosophy of war goes, Ie Entertainment of pandering to the masses is give them what they want politics is destroying the society.

I have since then gone through your Maps of Meaning course, your Personality course, TONS of clips from these lectures that are circulating on youtube and various interviews, podcasts and now the biblical series. It's just invaluable the information that i have recieved from you! I have questioned my habits and surroundings before but not with these tools. This time it's with a more extensive understanding on how and why things work the way they do and that gives me WAY more motivation to put what I've learned into practice so that I can become a better person. It seems less likely I can become willfully blind towards a potential demise of my being so how could I not be motived towards striving towards the good of life?

I will keep watching everything you do and I also plan to do all of the self authoring programs. I feel more hopeful than I've been in a long time. For all the years I've been down in chaos and hell from the causes of family problems, personal loses, addiction, martyrdom, resentment, broken heart, trust issues, depression and fear all bundled up in a clusterfuck of a traumatic and nihalistic state of mind I now feel I can put that wisdom to better use.

He starts from his own preconceived notions about values and obligations and his whole mental framework is designed to justify it. It's strikingly obvious from the way he speaks, sometimes he just lets it slip out and even he doesn't notice.

Also, despite how careful and intelligent he is when he is speaking, he makes SOOOO many fallacious assumptions or reasonings, completely invalid lines of logic, he uses artistic metaphorical language and tries to pull some objective facts out of it. His whole world view is just completely fudged"

UgiTP5ZTZMydVXgCoAEC,Avery Fleeharty,1504485104839,can someone explain on a physical or chemical level why a baby without touch/interaction would die?
UgjiEoZmxcvBHHgCoAEC,Qimodis,1504485104853,"The problem I have is that he insists that suffering is always undeniable and positive emotion is always deniable. It is possible to be in an apathetic and decadent state where you don't care about the stake through your arm, but, on the other hand, if you are really experiencing something meaningful or good, it is virtually equally hard to deny in my opinion. From the outset, we are forced pragmatically, based on biological processes that we only half-understand, to accept one thing as better than the other, as a minimum supposition for action. Doesn't it make sense to make the smallest necessary amount of unprovable suppositions? Sam Harris takes certain suppositions as axiomatic, and even if his breaching of the is-ought gap is technically wrong, the results he arrives at are good- and aren't the results the whole point of religious truth here? The same religion can take many forms and be interpreted to justify wildly differing actions, and it is really the culture or rather the generalized meta-culture that actually assigns value within society. 

PS
I think that it is incomplete to say that conscientiousness is just about being distressed when you aren't doing anything: it is the combination of distress and a pleasant feeling of fulfillment when you are doing something, and similarly, if you are an introvert, there is little comparable to the rush of dopamime when after a noisy day, you go somewhere where you realize you are completely alone and undisturbed- that is why many children on the autistic spectrum like to hide under boilers, it excludes the entire world around them and allows them to be in a kind of blissful peace. (in my personal experience, I liked to crouch in the little switch room/boiler room of the house, and, while there was no noise from the outside, imagine that that room was the entire universe, and was floating through empty void/vacuum. The feelings of extreme calm and, well, coziness were certainly more than a 'relief of suffering' or 'being alone in a crowd', I was fine just walking around, but it was pleasant to do it.)"

I see the notion of ""god"" as inherently childish, as grown adults looking to it as a sort of parent instead of being self reliant. I don't think someone who has confidence and sees themselves as an adult can honestly believe in religion, as it is basically the idea of forever being a child. Some people may be too weak to grow up and accept responsibility for their actions, and religion is a good way to keep these weak people adhering to society, but it doesn't change the fact that it is by definition a childish way of looking at the world."

UgiDnFo_cru3VngCoAEC,Belias Phyre,1504485110169,"I have an odd habit I've noticed. When I do something good out of the ordinary, I feel good about it and want to do it again up until I receive praise from my Mom. Once she notices it, and comments positively on it, I want to throw it away, scrap it, deface it. I'm not exactly sure why, but it has shaped a lot of my behavior. The opposite isn't true, if I act badly, and she notices and comments, I don't double down to spite her, or cease to please her; her opinion doesn't matter. 

I think it may be that I don't want her to feel a sense of accomplishment from my accomplishments because I feel I've accomplished this thing in spite of her, not because of her. So I guess this means I see my mother as an antagonist, which makes sense. When I was a child, my brother was a fiend and a sadist towards me. Most nights I was afraid to sleep, believing he might feel like ending my life while I was helpless. But I understood, even though my brother was a monster, my mother enabled, even rewarded his behavior, so who was the bigger threat?"

I score 44th on it and 14th on Orderliness. But I am not so sure.... When I was at my previous job, there were time where I voluntarily would work on weekends to get more work done by the end of the week, I sometimes would work from 10am to 11pm if needed, once I worked 3 weeks non stop even sleeping on a room at the work department on the weekends so I could keep working, etc. But then, I started getting depressed, my work wasn't being validated by my boss and I quit. Now I am 6 months unemployed so far at my parents house... I spend my day either going to the gym, looking for jobs, wasting time on YouTube by watching JBP lectures, read science articles on a thing I just had an idea on, read about psychology, etc. Thing is I am a Biochemist, and I am wasting my time reading about other things so far from my field and watching YouTube videos, that makes me re-think myself and presume I am not industriousness actually... I also got 2 coding courses because I got a job on bioinformatics and I do them totally unscheduled when ever I feel like it. But then I actually got a call I didn't have the job anymore before I even got it :/

People who experience sensations more strongly will be more prone to disgust.
UgxbDDojsvGyPIbtWGB4AaABAg,Marta Dias,1530664169910,I'm on percentil 85 of conscientiousness and 80 for openess. I would say that conscientousness is highly related with guilt.

Ugz6htZTR5iM-EkcB594AaABAg,Claudio Trevisan,1530664169942,"As someone who scored 96 out of 100 on conscientiousness here has been my experience with what Jordan Peterson says. 

Guilt: Feeling guilty if I don't do something is dead on. It is very difficult for me to just relax and do nothing. I would have a very difficult time being a musician on tour as was his example. When I go on trips, I can handle a couple of days, but any more than four stresses me out. I feel like I am missing out on pursuing my goals. 

Depression: If I were fired from a job, I do not believe I would be depressed. I have never in my life been depressed. I don't think I could have it in me to be depressed as I rarely ever dwell on the past. I am much more concerned with the future and prone to anxiety. As a therapist mentioned to my mother, we have higher than normal levels of serotonin and low levels of dopamine (not sure if this is true at all). But that statement is interesting. It could explain why we don't ever feel depressed or the need to pursue satiating (which is correlated with serotonin) goals. Rather we focus on task and achievement oriented goals. Progress is what gives us little dopamine hits, which is why I think I am so conscientious. The guilt is the negative driver and the progress is the positive motivator. 

Disgust: I wouldn't call it disgust, I would call it irritability. I wouldn't feel disgusted to drink my own sterile spit from a glass. On the contrary, little things irritate me. Chewing really loudly or obnoxiously, leaving dishes out, putting your stuff all over the counter and living room ( I live with 3 roommates). I don't get disgusted but I get very pissed off. 

Order: I like things put in its place. I like to see the counters clear, it's calming. Although I like things to be clean and orderly, I care more about order than cleanliness. 

Born with it or developed?: Interesting... I think a little of both. My friends find it odd that I make my bed every morning. I thought that was a normal thing. As I grew up, my mother always had me make my bed first thing in the morning. I always had to do my homework before I could go out and play. I always had to do my chores first before I could go do anything else. And I also watched how my parents acted. Work first play later. And I wasn't always to the extreme I am now. I used to not have a morning routine, I used to not have a set schedule, I used to be much more open to spontaneous things and just relaxing. This was me freshman year. After getting in trouble with the police for an MIP, twice, it took my conscientiousness to a whole other level. Not all at once, but gradually. Bit by bit, I added more to my morning routine, more to my daily task list, more order, more work. Its like going to the gym, once you start, its hard to stop. You feel guilty if you stop. At the same token, I do believe I could ease off if I really wanted to. I just don't really want to. I do wish I could be more easy going, but I do really enjoy all the benefits I get from pursuing my goals.

Just my experience, could be all wrong."

Dr. Peterson, is it possible that you could measure industriousness as more of a measure of suppression of action than a certain action performed? Delayed gratification sounds hard to express as an explicit reaction, but maybe easier to see as a lack of reaction? How long can someone hang onto a $20 bill that you gave them with the instruction not to use it, sort of test?
 
I'm average industriousness and very high orderliness, but my husband is exceptionally high in industriousness and very high in orderliness and the way he talks about hard work, it's more of a will to push through than a motivation to do. Sort of reflected in Hitler's fascination with will as well."

I have went through times in my life where I was becoming more industrious and it was getting easier by the day. It only started getting easier after I abandoned my one-meal-a-day diet and began to eat food at certain times of the day out of necessity."

UgwoKAvyZ0QcPVWxPJh4AaABAg,Gail Spurlock,1525393795385,"What is very interesting about criticizing the Jews for only engaging in commerce, not production is that most of the European countries forbade Jewish people from owning property.  They could not engage in manufacturing because that entailed owning land, buildings, equipment, etc.

The Jewish people lived within the restrictions imposed and still managed to not only survive but flourish.  In Will Durant's ""Story of Civilization"", through out the middle ages and renaissance, there were several occasions where the Jewish banks loaned money to the European governments as they spent their nations into bankruptcy.  Then, after being bailed out by Jewish bankers, they banned Jewish people and deported them without ever repaying the loans.

This is the cycle mentioned in Hitler's speeches as though they were corrupt.  Their patience, being deported after being robbed, accepting the circumstances and doing their best in the new land is little short of miraculous and forgiving."

I think the reason for an innate fear to people who may look different relates more to how a stranger to a new community in ancient times could normally be a scout for a greater threat on the horizon. 

as someone that lives in a mostly white state, I can go months without seeing anyone that doesn't have white skin. My internal reaction is that of fear, which I know to be something that is not a valid emotional response and I ignore it and not let it effect me. However when I went to a mostly black college, over time that initial response went away. Then as time went by it happened again later in life.

   I figured it was a response that come about due to threats that could come from any new and different visitor to a community. Those who didn't have it would of most likely been wiped out like the Dodo bird was. 

   In the psychology of the landscape. One thing to keep in mind is that people feel most comfortable along the edge of the forest. Because standing in a field could leave you vulnerable and most likely you would be wiped out. So when designing walking paths it is best to have trees along them otherwise people won't be inclined to use them and find alternate paths to get to where they want to go. 

I get the disease reference  but I don't think that is the cause for fear of differences in people. 

  and American  Conservaties don't have a problem with homosexuality.  Religious ones make think its a sin but when you live in America it shouldn't matter to you what other people think about your lifestyle. The marriage aspect is a little different because as a conservative I fail to see why Government is involved in marriage if not to incentivize it to promote another generation which doesn't happen in gay relationships therefore its a null point. 

 as a conservative I can safely say we like immigration!! its a great thing along with free trade and capitalism .
   however if we don't have laws or a mechanism in which to use to make sure people coming to a country at least embrace the values of that country like those spelled out in the constitution, then a civil war may likely arise as a difference in culture and beliefs can cause issues. 

   As for federalism of the idea of states rights. By breaking down to smaller section of the country, where what is good for one part could be bad for another and to give the people of that state more power over their government, Local governments are a net benefit to allowing each persons voice having more say then federal government. 

   I Think you miss understand conservatives in America and how and why we value the original system. The reason for that has less to do with wanting to stick to tradition and more to do with the value that each of the traditional systems have. Make them better thats great, but when better means removing freedoms that they allow for than No!! 


   I know you did an interview on the dailywire but Check out Ben Shapiro and his talk with Dave Rubin. He spells out conservatism and the reasons that support it and it is not so much a resistance to change as it is a resistance trying to make something that is already perfected better, when the cost of that is personal freedom."

Despite the efforts of the military government of the occupied territories,  typhus was not only not eliminated from the occupied territories but it spread into Germany where typhus had been eradicated decades earlier.  Eventually Zyclon B was developed to kill off the rats and fleas that spread typhus. 

By the time Hitler was seeking power,  this disease was part of the common experience of German people who may have been preconditioned to be receptive to someone who would prey on their disgust/disease reaction."

I live in Silicon Valley, California and I see this phenomenon happen all the time, the spoiled natives grow up to become losers while the immigrants such as the Chinese and the Indians are buying (multi-)million dollar houses all the time; and it's because they crave it and can afford it via serfdom for the largest tech companies in the world. Where as the natives do not because they are spoiled americans who are rich with ignorant bliss.

And not afraid of disease so much as demographic replacement and pressures that will lead to so much outbreeding of the peculiar traits of ethnic groups that they become extinct. It's about continuation of a species/race that we believe is worth preserving, and not a fear of smallpox. Consider the rates of reproduction among the races, such as non-white Hispanic and white people, and blacks and white people. Modern Whites are reproducing at a significantly reduced pace while every other race is reproducing as fast as they can. Why is it a sin to want to preserve blondes, blue eyed people, Russians, the French, the Irish, the English, etc., as a species? Why is this unacceptable? No one is calling for Asians, Indians, Africans, or South American Indians to be demographically wiped from the Earth or made such a tiny minority they will inevitably be bred out of existence entirely. Why wouldn't we want, for example, the Irish to continue to exist indefinitely? Are white people so flawed; are we ""finished"" doing whatever the universe intended us to do? Is our amazing capacity to invent and our forms of art just a result of custom and not genetics, so that people with any combination of genetics will be able to take our place in continuing Western civilization?

People who are lower in conscientiousness I think tend to live more immediately, in the moment, and thus have a hard time grasping that their current situation is not permanent and have an inability to look towards the future to a situation where they don't feel anxious.

try asking an anorexic patient what kind of person they are and what they enjoy doing in their spare time, they'll have a fucking existential crisis. that's not the case for people who are simply concerned with their appearance.

more than a marginal number of guys are affected by it too, myself included (i was hospitalized for it on the brink of death at 17).

although i do know from my own experience that i didn't realize just how emaciated and sick i was. i actually believed for the longest time than i was getting ""fitter"" and ""leaner"", and that i was perfectly healthy and not even starving myself. i'm more inclined to think it was a deeply ingrained denial rather than an actual perceptual disorder though. body image was only a small facet of the obsession in my case, and to me it would make sense that an obsession as strong as anorexia could just completely deaden any rational thoughts (i.e. i'm too thin, my health is deteriorating critically, and i need to gain weight) in its path to kill you.

In other discussions Peterson reported that a strong indicator of political correctness is if the subject has a low ability to articulate themselves linguistically. Now he's made it clear that political correctness is specifically separate from liberalism, but political correctness is still technically a leftist viewpoint. An authoritarian left viewpoint, which Peterson says they don't have strong scales for yet.

We are a very very sick society. Our country is trillions of dollars in debt. We give our land away to 3rd world immigrants because we are too busy maxing out credit cards on porn and stupid shit we don't need. 

The vast majority of media companies are owned by Jews. The vast majority of porn companies are owned by Jews. The vast majority of record labels are owned by Jews. The vast majority of banks are owned by Jews. The US federal reserve is even fucking ran by Jews.

I wonder whether having a ""disgust"" reflex is a bad thing in today's society. I had the exact experience Dr. Peterson described when a drunken homeless man asked me the time... I was disgusted and didn't answer, he called me an ""ignorant bastard"", which made me feel I was even more right to have ignored him, as it proved my initial assumption that he could be aggressive was right.

See, the thing is, we've got a pretty darn totalitarian disease-fighting strategy here in America.  Every disease is an excuse for more tyranny, and horrifying tyranny at that -- medical tyranny.  Forced chemotherapy, forced vaccinations, and more -- like the release of GMO mosquitoes to fight the mosquito that carries Zika, a virus that's blamed for the shrunken heads in Brazil that were most likely caused by the agro-chemicals at use in the region (I've read that the highest consumption of agricultural chemicals in the world right now is Brazil).  Brazil consumes massive amounts of Roundup.  Roundup causes microcephaly:
pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx1001749 
From the study:
""GBH [Glyphosate-based herbicides] produced similar effects in chicken embryos, showing a gradual loss of rhombomere domains, reduction of the optic vesicles, and microcephaly.""
But certainly we can smash the Zika virus anyway by forced vaccinations and gmo mosquito launches along with all sorts of other wonderful things we can do to... lead a life free from the iron boot of totalitarianism?  Do I have that right?  That will  bring no relief to the babies suffering not from a communicable disease but from man-made chemicals. Same thing with cancer here in the States.  It's difficult to argue longevity is the cause for cancer when our children suffer from the disease.  We're taught to blame ourselves for living longer and not replicating our DNA right.  ANYTHING AT ALL to take the blame off the man-made chemicals that are likely causing almost all of it.

Just some rectifications though: there are no proof zyklon B was used on humans in concentration camps, it was ordered for delousing units, therefore gas chambers are most probably a war propaganda first used by soviets, then recuperated by zionists who used it to justify the creation of Israel and their current theft of the lands of Palestinians. This doesn't mean jews weren't persecuted though, they indeed were racially discriminated against.

One other point is that the rise of the National-Socialists was also partly due to a perception that Bolsheviks (and the massacres they committed upon that Christian nation) were mostly jews. This is also mostly correct. This doesn't mean any of what they did was justified though, but it is quite interesting to see that even someone who position himself as a ""sayer of truth"" (implying that it is truth above all, even if it extremely politically non-correct) can't himself escape this war propaganda and rewriting of history favoring and removing the responsibility from Judaism and some jews."

Ugi3WfGlykXIIXgCoAEC,Debonaire Death,1504485063110,"45:10 Okay so this particular slide leads me to a conundrum regarding your theories, professor Peterson.

You suggest that more conscientious and intolerant people are more disgust-sensitive. You also discuss a correlation between conservative views and these same qualities.

However, while I understand that they are far more tolerant on an interpersonal level with in-group members, liberals seem at least equal with conservatives in their disgust at a broader resolution of society. ""Shame"" takes a prominent role in the leftist confrontation of dissent, and disgust seems to play more and more of a factor the more radical the particular ideological group becomes.

This reminds me of Arthur Deikman's work on cult behavior. What Deikman discovered is that as the homogeneity of ""group think"" is consolidated, individuals external to the group are devalued and treated with aversion. It's very easy to look at this immunologically: as the ideological diversity of the group wains, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to an ideological ""epidemic"" that could decimate the population, and instinctively insulates itself from dialogue with opposing views as a defense mechanism.

Political extremists exhibit these same qualities. My question for you is whether it is this ideological homogeneity that could trigger the paradoxical disgust response found in radicalized groups that are founded on principals of openness and tolerance. Perhaps you could make the argument that the openness and tolerance are simply false principals that serve as a facade for the fomenting of resentment, but it seems like the psychoimmunological dynamic has something important to do with all of this."

This a posting on the Third Space wall, University of Victoria. 

To be honest reading that makes me want to join the military to kill the authors of this crap and at the same time eliminate the rest of the liars, useless eaters that come in and take stuff. The very narrative that this is pushing is forcing, so called white people that have no capital to die, or move form their land their children made of developed. Whilst forcing them to give over their university teachings as these individuals attempt to be the perfect model student for the profs that are leftover. This has a dramatic affect and teach gin and creating hate. A normal person should get angry and seek to destroy the author of such outlandish not proof. The very document is crpa and has zero evidence, and puts the worlds woes and any defines at the oh well you fit into the violent male category, or you fit into female hate, when they were talking about or against feminism, suddenly you were ea malechovinist. 

Regrettably these people get thousands of dollasrsan d tax payer money to create hate. Unfortunately, My soul wants me to go into the military and kill people because of people like this, althgouh this is one instance. It has been thousands upon thousands of instances. I just want to mop the earth in fire and blood, until all these little shits are dead from north korea, Mao, states, Canada, Africa. Every single seed of rebellion and desent against truth. If you call for peace you come to deceive and destroy, in allah. Serious read the fucking Koran before defending it. Read the bible before defending it. This shit is stupid. Read buddha's history and not the stupid religion that was made out of it. Buddha is far more interesting person, that went into the mountains to get away form the lies, war, and greed. Basically by walking away told them to go into their own ruin, for it was in their hearts they were already destroyed. Now I ask what mercy am or do I have. The only option remaining for I to peacefully gain a civil skill to be paid and have a honest living and family is the military. The civil grounds is filled with these people and they constantly lie and stab you in the back and if you not' want them by you or here your a racist,. No I am not , There was black people here before. The whole hit nonsense is there a a plethora of 100% blonde haired, blue eyed natives, so this doesn't make any sense, that ...

UggtrCG5xCQ-oHgCoAEC,Dino Dogan,1504485083917,"Terence Mckenna might have an interesting theory regarding conscientiousness. He might say that people who are high in conscientiousness (which is as you frequently have pointed out tied to disgust) are the fall back strategy for the process unfolding. We can call that process an evolution if we like, or something else, but I like the generic abstraction above it, hence ""process unfolding"". 

While the rest of us omnivore monkeys are eating anything and everything to survive and move the evolutionary needle forward, often by ingesting mind-expanding drugs as TM proposes and I second,  some of us better develop an aversion to this process or we risk self-extermination. Being open, extroverted, and willing to try anything is a high-risk / high-reward strategy. 

So channeling my inner TM, I'd say that conscientious high disgust group are a fall back strategy for evolution. 

I have to admit that there's a bit of an uncomfortable hole in my proposal. It's the disgust that is the active ingredient in this process, and I'm not sure which way the causation goes. Does disgust produce conscientiousness, or does conscientiousness produce disgust? If disgust produced conscientiousness I'd feel a lot better about my Terence Mckenna theory.

in the ""spit in a sterile cup"" experiment the right disgust target would be the spit in the cup (even though it is an over reaction), while the wrong target is the scientist telling you to do something disgusting.
when you step in dog poop the right target is the shit itself so you clean it off the shoe, and not to trow the entire shoe in the trash. 
when the Jewish community in pre WW2 Germany is so much better off then the average German, the best target for disgust is the perceived lack of philanthropy and integration, as it seems clear that the rest of Germany could likely learn of there success. the wrong target is the entire Jewish community and to then send them all to the gas chambers.

The great thinkers of this age will be made for the mold of that system will that system be capatalism on top and sosialism down below but what wing and how is it funded and​ controlled. In my opinion a new central socialism doctrine has to be conscripted to make that even feasable. We know capitalism works but it does not play nice with sosialism and visa versa ( not the working bit ) A good place to start from is to find the value trates of the lower end of the bell curb on IQ and then build a system of reward for the practice. In other words what is the lower end better at then the middle. But then the dangers of a I'll composed system is also eugenics where the cost of sustainability gets to high and some clown stands up and offers the final solution to market conscious people who can do numbers.

To take this further, do we have a definition of ""authoritarian governance"" in the following discussion of parasites and authoritarianism? For example, would it not be fair to say that the best measurement of authoritarianism is the tax rate, at least economic authoritarianism? There are various forms of authoritarianism, usually divided into economic liberty and personal liberty infringements e.g. what you do in your bedroom or to your own body.

These are in no way scientific terms, so trying to include them in any study will lead to serious ambiguity. It reminds me of this definition of ""race"" where you actually are the race you identify with (race as social construct), but it is much worse in this case, because the term ""liberal"" has a very wide range of meaning from e.g. laissez-faire to socialist economics, just as a start. These are antithetical definitions, but still widely used!

The disgust drive can go really really bad, for example...

Anti-Semitism is exactly the same as delousing. Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology, it is a matter of cleanliness. In just this same way anti-Semitism for us has not been a question of ideology but a matter of cleanliness.
-Heinrich Himmler

The disgust drive can be perfect, for example...

Matthew 7:6 
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
 -Jesus Christ

One must remember disgust has it's place.  Obviously if it is connected to bigotry and injustice then this drive is destructive.  However the disgust drive helps us protect us against poison, instills survival in children,  and create just societies. 

Proverbs 29:27 
An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

We should be disgusted at a serial killer for example. Bernie Madoff causes us to shake our heads and flare our nostrils.  Timothy McVeigh makes our stomach turn when he calls innocent blood collateral damage. The killing season in Chicago that makes no difference between harden criminals and the elderly is another disgusting feeling when we think upon it.  The pedophile rings in the Catholic Church cause disgust in us.  We are right to house this dangerous feeling.  It must be used properly."

UghPR5MdxyLsdngCoAEC,Booop Booop,1504485120721,"There appears to be a lot of people that are confused by some of what Dr. Peterson was saying about Germany, so I will try to explain some of his points. He said that after WWI, Germany was a very chaotic place because of prevalence of diseases, economic turmoil (hyperinflation, high unemployment, and lack of public provisions), and extremely weakened institutions (the government was dysfunctional for various reasons). This chaos caused by all the aforementioned factors led Germans to wanting order to rebalance Germany's equilibrium. 

It so happened that Hitler and the Nazis had the best marketing strategy because it manipulated the desire of ORDER that many Germans wanted for their country. They developed simple yet very effective documentaries, pamphlets, and literature that appealed very well with many Germans such that the Nazis were able to win the country over. 

He then explains how the Nazis continued to utilize order as the main motivation for their party and ultimately their country. Part of accomplishing order was to kill the Jews because the Jews were responsible for the 'disorder' of their nation. Hence, the obsession with comparing them to 'parasites' that need to be 'eradicated.' Now, if you think that this is cherry picking history then look up the Hutu massacre of the Tutsis in Rwanda where there are many similarities. One can also look up the Yugoslavia war, it too is quite similar in its buildup."

I've started projects that take years to complete, and I keep at it because it's unthinkable that I would stop.  It's almost, but not quite, like OCD for a check list.  I have a list going constantly, and I will check off all the things.  Rarely does something come off the list without me having checked the box first.  It bothers me on an aesthetic level, as well.  I leave things there to nag at me.  

I'm not OCD, in that things I deem as annoyances only to myself can stay undone or half-done.  For example, when teaching my kids about chores, my son would often wear the clean bowls on his head like a hat, and I could let that go, even though it's gross.  I can see the importance of him learning the skills verses something done perfectly right.  In my business, or outside commitments, I am the complete opposite.

firstly, the skew is because women are more agreeable than men, and they get far less prison sentence for roughly the same crime and get accused far less often.. that skews the comparison...
over that i think people who are agreeable in general get easier sentence (no where near the gender gap) but generally....

also, the crimes even though equally damaging but done by agreeable people specially women is in general concidered less severe
 (for example in domestic violence, the women do less physical harm, so people suddenly forget that is not physical damage in itself that constitutes the severity of crime (or else most athletes and their coaches will be criminals ) 
but the intent behind the act , that the person commiting the crime is not worthy of cooperation... also that is partly the reason why many crimes against children are neglected)

also that crimes pitted against  compassion are dealt much less severly like someone killing their spouse for anticipation of threat against children , or similar crimes out of misplaced fear (this is over an excuse to favour women)

from my personal experience also...i don't think that even most criminals are disagreeable, but trying to wear a mask of it...

however the ones doing most of the damage are by far more disagreeable....

 but that's a different story, not the same as if you rise is disagreeableness your are more likely to be antisocial , well also depends on how you define antisocial, but not criminal......

Moreover i think agreeable people are more morally compromised ,in the sense that they hold double standards more ........ violate the principal of 
'do onto others as you have others do onto you'
much more"

UgzSho_urg9a9hZh6ip4AaABAg,Andy Chow,1520122884896,"I have a question. Are spiders an innate fear? I had a nightmare when I was 2-4 years old about two spiders fighting in a white room. I overcame that fear, rationally, but if ever I see a spider, something deep down instantly triggers a complete activation and shoving of my blood into my muscular system. It lasts 1/10th of a second, and probably activates within 20ms-45ms of seeing the spider (i.e. before I can even tell what I'm seeing consciously). Then my regular self takes over and doesn't care. Is this innate or a non-structural (non-primal) construct?"

UgxsL3IWsYzVJg0xmzh4AaABAg,Matthew Anderson,1517703684934,"Starting from 58:00 Peterson builds up to saying ""it's not 'follow your bliss'"" (58:38), a direct counter to that other modern champion of mythology and archetypes, Joseph  Campbell. From Campbell I always got the impression that ""follow your bliss"" meant pursuing what inspires you, what you enjoy working hard at, what causes you to lose track of time, etc. Sounds wonderful, if a bit new agey and idealistic.
 
And the truth is, we often don't do it.  Why? Because there are many dragons out there that confine your life to a small territory. Dragons that will devour you if you get too close. How can one follow one's bliss with all these dragons getting in the way? Suddenly following one's bliss doesn't sound so nice and warm and blissful. We can sort of do it without facing our dragons, but rather weakly. How many artists are out there who never activate the bold daring visions lying dormant within for fear of criticism, spending a life circling it from a distance, ""pursuing their bliss"", but never fully realizing it?

So in a way, the treasure the dragon guards is the bliss, or the exponential growth of it. Campbell just didn't focus on the terrifying requirement of his statement. Peterson says something like, ""no this is going to scare the crap out of you, it has to in order to wake you up to your full potential. But it's more than worth it, in fact it's necessary if you want to truly live""."

Interesting how Peterson talks about the higher risk of  great failure in men's life, and of course gets a laugh (...). But does not bring up the flipside, that one needs to know to understand the first part: That the chance of great success is bigger for men, or more broadly viewed from an evolutionary standpoint, and this is about evolution at its core, for males than females.

This is due to males having the possibility, if very successful, to mate with a very high number of females and have many descendants in the next generation. Females have not the  same possibility for extreme success. But have also not the same risk of great failure, that is, not to get to reproduce at all... Males might win big, or lose big. Females, have not those same type of risks and rewards to nearly the same degree. 

And this affects a lot of other things for humans. Why is the bell curve for IQ pointier for women than for men? Seems to be connected, right..? 

But this is not ""polite"" to talk about. And explaining why that is properly would take some writing, more than might be suitable for a youtube comment...^^"

Your videos have inspired me to push past those fears and I now am on my way to starting school in January to pursue a CS degree.

UgiqkeCJQX0ch3gCoAEC,Amy Jones,1472948488822,"I have always felt that the female initiation is childbirth.  At least, that's how I understood it as a child.  There is no need to brave yourself to hang from hooks or spend the night alone in the woods if you know that it is likely that you will experience the pain of labour.   It always seemed like an inevitable and impossible gateway to me, and it is only recently that it has become normal for a woman (in this culture) to be older or to forego the experience entirely.  I say this, but when I consider the fairytales and so on, it is often the way that the young woman has to prove herself through arduous tasks, often as the servant of a witch or similar.  Is the female initiation really sustained self sacrifice (the heroine feeds all the animals in the barn before herself and so on) and housework?  Or would the initiation point be where she conquers the witch with her cleverness (or occasionally purity) 
and goes on to fullfil her duty and then be free to seek her own fortune?  I think I will have to give this quite a lot of consideration!  Thank you for making your lectures available!  I am a housewife who would normally not have access to this level of education and I am very grateful!"

I get many archetypical ideas from these lectures that would fit right into a novel. Nature is that which gives us life, but at the same time destroys us. So why should not we do the same to it? That´s the perfect antagonist villain, it´s a noble cause to end suffering, but completed in a twisted way. A Inversion of the Buddha dharma. Even God became possessed by this archetype - he flooded the world to end all the evil and suffering. And it´s quite possible that humans are doing it right now, with technology ment to make our lifes easier (causing climate change). It might seem that this archetype is not only rooted in us humans, but in nature itself. And we humans are the tragic greek hero, who means to do good but has an inherent fault causing or destined fall. It would be ironic if the world ended like a greek drama, cause ancient greece is the pillar of the modern world. It would mean that the artiststs and creative people of that civilization  (in a way) prophesied it´s fall right from the beginning. That would certainly make Plato discouraged, as he saw drama, and poetics in general as a treat to the state."

Dr. Peterson addresses this elsewhere when he points out that poverty is decreasing dramatically world wide. A Parado distribution would make such a thing impossible. So what is really going on?

1) The games are involuntary, trade is voluntary. 
2) The games are zero-sum, trade is positive sum.

So in the game, flip a coin and the person getting tails loses $1 and cannot say no, while the person getting heads gains $1. That's zero-sum, one person's gain is another person's loss.

Actual trade only occurs if both parties want it to occur. To get the buyer's money, the seller must offer something the buyer values more than the price, at the same time that the seller values the price more than what is offered.

Both win. Both believe they are better off after the trade than before the trade, or the trade would not have occurred. Net wealth has increased.

Repeat this positive-sum fact in every transaction, from penny candy to a cargo ship full of containers of who-knows-what, and the reality of the economic engine becomes clear. Every restriction, every tax, every tariff, every trade barrier, decreases the positive results of trade, and creates or perpetuates poverty.

If you want the world to be a better place, start by tearing down trade barriers, restrictions, and regulations everywhere, about everything."

Personality tests, including the Big 5, rely on self-reporting. The point is to give honest accurate information about myself to see how I fit into this framework of categorizing people. The point of an interview is to sell my skills and positive qualities to get the best position possible and bending the truth is not only common but somewhat expected. We all know to say ""too perfectionistic"" when asked what our biggest weakness is regardless of how perfectionistic we are.  If I took a personality test the way I take interviews I would score much higher for conscientiousness than if I'm simply trying to understand my personality better for my own self-awareness and understanding. What you see as a strength of The Big 5 I consider a flaw: the personality characteristics measured are clearly more along the lines of good vs bad than is the case with Jung's theories about personality type. To make personality typing all about predicting success makes some types seem objectively better than others, but it's an illusion because you can't define success objectively. Your definition of success is going to be determined by your subjective values."

I think we're already seeing something like this - just compare a list of typical reasons for being sacked with a list of ADHD symptoms.  They are pretty much the same thing.

Exponential distribution maximizes entropy for given mean and lower bound. In physics we call the exponential distribution of particles in the spectrum of energies Boltzmann distribution.
What you can see in the animation is that first the people with money haven't had much time to trade so the money distribution was limited mostly by variance ('how much money have you had enough time to lose'). As the trading progresses, the lower bound ('you can't have less than zero, but you can return from zero to positive amounts') constraint  becomes dominant.

So JBP always mentions people high in neuroticism in a context that they are anxious or depressed most of the time, or react to certain situations inadequately. Soooo, does it mean that ppl that are high in trait neuroticism were just unlucky to be born high in this trait and doomed to suffer more than those who score low on this specific trait?! Can people high in neuroticism shift this trait closer to the balance or being even low on neuroticism? What these people can do about it throughout the life not to be depressed, live a life and not fall into the chaos?

They protect their own and hold up spears to impositions of blind processes. Their allegiance is split unevenly . Forty percent goes to the company they work for, but sixty percent goes for their employee, their troops.  This sounds like incompetence but THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.  

Tests do not inspire performance, LEADERS DO.  Part of what makes a good manager is the the willingness to look out for their troops while holding them accountable.   We all worked under the ""the new sheriff in town"".  The guy or gal who loves telling you that you are not indispensable and that there are a healthy pool of applicants waiting to take your place.  They love issuing warning.  They savor moments when they can let a person know that the company has a mandate to get rid of dead weight.  They love to see your heart beat through your chest.  Theses types get reassigned.  They are tough IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!  Good managers are like good generals.  They build up their employees.  They favor them.  However they do not let them command, it is given to the manager to command. They set the agenda.  The best managers push back against upper management.  Sometimes they have to fold, but they boast about their resistance and THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO SO!  This inspires loyalty and respect.

Napoleon worked over a bunch of run down, complacent, peace time, often part time, disillusioned soldiers.  He inspired them to be the terror of Europe by dressing in the same uniform as them.  He ate with them.  He encouraged them. He believed in them. He praised them openly.  He did not eat his own, he protected his own but with accountability.

UgiyOuCx-V--AngCoAEC,bob smith,1504485072142,"1:02:50 I think this is a point that most people will completely gloss over and is actually really important to consider. The economy of America post WW2 was just absolutely filled to the brim with high paying jobs that required basically zero education, expertise or experience to do. Basically it just completely obliterated the standard selection forces that are usually operating on a population, that those that reproduce TEND to be the ones who are actually smart, hard working, have basic self control and planning for the future, that sort of thing. NOT SO in 1940 and 50's America. Basically any fat retard who had the ability to not drink themselves to death could get by just fine and still have plenty of money time and social opportunities to pass on their disgusting genes to the next generation.

You look at America, and Americans today in general, and it makes perfect sense. Just WHERE did all these fucking selfish unenlightened idiots come from? Answer: From our society that is just so wealthy and has so much excess that there are essentially NO barriers for ANYONE reproducing anymore. At best, about 15% of the population aren't degenerate moronic simpletons who are the offspring of degenerate moronic simpletons who had no business reproducing. You go to other countries and it's not like that. It's a much closer equilibrium split it seems to me. About half the population are actually intelligent, awake, and capable of self control, while the other half are basically borderline braindead monkey's whose sole purpose in life is to fuck and shove food in their face"

BUT, there are many options for entrepreneurs such as selling online or ebay these days. Or getting crowd funding.

1) You can approach mom & pop stores such as variety stores and leave your products on consignment. They may give you front counter space too!
2) You can manufacture small runs of your product but it might cost you a lot, say $10 for a unit that you sell for only $3. But so what? It is about testing.
3) Even big box stores have franchises which means you can approach the owner who may help you test your product in their store, including Saturday in store demo's,"

Anyone can build an audience today (Again, a lot of hard work but very doable, and ironically is exactly what you are doing right now. You bring massive value and the internet is rewarding you greatly) by adding value (key point!). The free economy has been proving itself out with great results.

He argued, essentially, that there isn't much you can do to provide someone with more information than if you provide them a computer. I would argue that giving someone teachers would radically alter their access to information because of specializations. It is well known the effect a good teacher can have, it accelerates and improves learning more than anything else. Someone who goes to a good university is NOT operating on the same informational landscape as someone scavenging the internet.

There's very little value in that statement, given the extremely diverse situational, geographic, demographic, pay scale and profession factors in which that statistic should actually play zero role in your decision. It's only when the statistic is isolated to a specific demographic would it be more applicable: ""college graduates on average spend an average of 2 years at their first corporate job"" for example.

I feel like he does this a lot, like when he encourages people to pick a career path which aligns with their temperament, but not where they actually want to be in life. Like I don't identify with my temperament, because I feel weak when I'm in my temperament, so why would I submit to that biological substrate rather than work hard (harder than most people I suppose) to improve the side of the spectrum I need to improve?"

One of the more compelling early chapters is on hockey players, and how most hockey players were born in the first 4 months of the year. The hypothesis is that his occurs because there is a hard break between hockey age groups starting at the beginning of the year. So you end up with January kids born in 2013 playing with December kids born in 2013. Obviously and 11 month difference at the age of 4 is going to advantage the January kid, and of course from there the idea is that it snowballs, or as JBP says, positive feedback loops."

The more conscious you are of consciousness the more terrible it becomes, and it can become a vicious cycle?  Prof. I'm really attempting to go past Nietzsche, to go beyond it; but every other thing we examine it seems he was already there... he said (in one of his books of course) that he was looking for those more godless than himself and I have imagined he was referring to those philosophers of the future he spoke of at times, those arrows he throws into the future and someone else more daring picks it up and does the same thing and throws them further... do you know any of those people/authors??  To use a modified phrase of his; those I may read to go beyond good and evil, to go beyond Nietzsche??  It is a bit frustrating to always find that any idea he's been there before; your descriptions of the primordial drives that do not let us do anything of importance ourselves  is a good start, any ideas where to go next?? who to read beyond Nietzsche? We read the new philosophers and it is a rehash of the same, or worse, a misinterpretation of the philosophers who came before. They are smart, but they're NOT going beyond, further... perhaps they lack DARING?  The will to ""live dangerously"". If there are any you consider like this please tell me.

Thanks Prof."

UgzEhpNLk880FOcsxxp4AaABAg,greyztone,1533342051649,"58:44 Crafty little switch there from the question of life having objective meaning (assuming that's what he means from ""meaning in a cosmic sense"") to subjective meaning. It's not a dopey question to ask if science can find an objective meaning for life. Science could have literally found evidence for a god, or an afterlife, or whatever. Indeed, it still might! As for subjective meaning, well by definition that's down to the individual and doesn't have to have any basis in anything at all beyond that.

It's all well and good to say that nihilism has no utility to daily life but to call it stupid and primitive because of that just betrays an agenda. Looking for the facts of existence and looking for the most effective ways to live your life are two different things. One might just as well say that the latter is stupid and primitive because it is based on biological impulse over reason."

If I go out on a limb, I'm concluding that the blind person(s) are using other non-visual cues to determine left from right (air flow, vibrations, sound, etc), but that doesn't seem to be well implied by what he actually says in this clip.

If I had to take what he says at face value, I'd have to assume he's implying some type of innate ""knowing"", which I don't think he's implying, and hope very much that he's not implying.

I'd rather just assume he didn't complete his train of thought, and he meant to say that senses like touch and hearing are so adapted to your nervous system that they provide enough data to make an accurate instinctual determination.

That animal was consciousness...  It's a frigging talkin ape!  What more could anyone want?

44:13 IMO Shamanic rituals ARE the origin of the story of the garden of Eden.  Ayahuasca looks like a snake climbing up the tree of life/knowledge.  When someone (probably a woman, maybe called Eve) figured out how to brew that ayahuasca with something with enough dimethyltryptamine THAT IT raised their level of consciousness.  It's not an allegorical story.  It's what friggin happened!  

THAT is why shamanism exists all over the world, because it actually IS what we are meant to be doing.  All modern religion is to hide that...

The ""eye"" everyone sees when they drink Ayahuasca is because we are evolved from animals which are very good as seeing snake/reptile eyes, because they were our ""gods"" back then and decided who lived, and who died."

This is worth listening to a few times, particularly if you're someone who's had issues with depression. 

One of the major features for me, and many others, is that feeling of being lost every time you get knocked back; you loose your long term perspective. It would be great to have a little boiled down sound-bite or ""mantra"", something that just summarises this section and reminds you that it's a transformative period. I think it would help a lot of people get through it quicker, and come out stronger.

This brings to mind the so-called ""rebellious phase"" of teenagers. Perhaps it is not anomalous, pathological, or otherwise deviant behaviour, but an evolutionary mechanism indicative of the development of independence from the family. It may be that it should therefore not be repressed or necessarily punished, but guided along healthy avenues.

One thing that bothers me, however, is that there doesn't seem to be a standard to choose ""mythological"" stories and interpretations of traditions. How do you make sure that you are not essentially picking and choosing metaphors that support the worldview you already have? For example, you seem to subscribe to the worldview that religious traditions are basically ""moral"". But isn't it also true that exactly these systems of faith motivated violent holy wars and raids by Muslims, Christians, and Jews? Atheists argue that it would take the pseudo-logic of religion to make a naturally friendly human being do horrible things.

I have read that the infant has more neurons or synapses, but they are not connected, they are however ready to be connected. A better analogy would be to compare the infant to the astronomically huge catalog of a major electronic distributor, and how a engineer picks and chooses a very small subset of the unconnected parts to make a product, thus connecting those parts. Overtime many parts in the catalog become unused, unsold, and are dropped from the catalog.  Those parts are called obsolete."

UgxFC7vBE4uTMAEv8FN4AaABAg,SixSixSix,1530663725747,"I think I understand most of what he says with reference to dominance hierarchies (so much interesting stuff) -- and I guess he allows room for the many actual exceptions to such beliefs as ""people at the top of the hierarchy being more likely to breed"" ---  

I think due to the way things are structured this is clearly no longer the case for humans -- with reference to such things as the movie ""idiocracy"" : Every unfortunate unfit ""dumbass"" (just as a loose description, for lack of me bothering to think of a better word) who feels like it can breed, and breed a LOT, and they DO (probably a lot more than people who may be far more ""fit"" to breed, say, from a deep, un-opinionated biological standpoint).... although maybe such dumbasses are at the top of a subset-hierarchy of dumbasses, and do not pass reference to larger structures, and the larger structures do not refer downwards : 
So : the way many things in society are currently structured is a bit of an upside-down pyramid, and will remain such, until the job-lot comes tumbling down. 

It's easy to see a lot of upside-down pyramids developing in society. For example, the cancer of management. There are many organisations with many more management and administration staff than the skilled people who actually do the work the organisation is purportedly supposed to do -- and I note that many times in such organisations, competence is actually not the selector for climbing upward into such managerial and executive structures (see ""Dilbert"", and everything in reality which that cartoon reflects).
Competence is a selector to a distinct point .... and then no longer."

However, I prefer The Gay Science as a starting point. It's much easier for beginners to read aphorisms, imo, than essays. Not to mention that the profundity of the aphorisms in The Gay Science is truly extraordinary. I would stay away from Nietzsche's later works (The Anti-Christ, Twilight of The Idols, and Ecco Homo) until a sufficient understanding of his middle works has been learned and internalized. I made the mistake of starting out with The-Antichrist during a time when I was a very angry, nihilistic person and thus merely read what I wanted into N (although that's very typical of alienated youth)."

So when we ""will value"" is it not then something bigger then, at least, the conscious will doing it, or isn't Nietzsche sorta saying that?"

UgyQ6iAPdzQLmxqyuuV4AaABAg,David Ewing,1533342430975,"Wow I just had an amazing realization in regards to Simba transforming into and subsequently transcending his father. He felt guilty and responsible for his father's death, and he was carrying that metaphorical weight. When he first has the transcendental experience seeing his father in the pool, he becomes conscious of his own short comings and vulnerabilities. After this experience he has accepted his responsibility and in essence picked up the metaphorical weight of his consciousness. When he confronts Scar and finds himself in his father's position near death, Scar's revelation that he was responsible for Mufasa's death takes the metaphorical weight of guilt Simba had, off his shoulders. The letting go of that guilt gives Simba the strength to overthrow the tyrant. 

In summary, we must accept responsibility, and lift our burdens of life. When you lift your load that life throws on you, you will learn we may be we are carrying around more than necessary, and we will become stronger when we allow ourselves to let go of the unnecessary burdens."

He said Mufasa overlooks the threat of Scar / his own dark side but it seems more like its not a lack of awareness of his malevolence but just a total confidence in his own ability to deal with Scar at any given moment, which perhaps speaks to our own overconfidence of being hero material, our irrational tendency to feel like we have the strength to not be swept up in something like a Nazi movement, so I'd be interested in his comment on that, and 2. He said that he feels like it's almost cheating to use this film to analyze Jungian archetypes because the writers were consciously aware of the archetypes, like archetypes should be subconsciously produced and if not they are somehow disauthenticated, but I don't quite understand this –why would archetypes be less authentic if consciously produced?"

Even though when I started, I had the feeling that's what the questions are engineered to do: I can't get past the fact that I'm wasting my time being thoughtful in answering each simple question/exploration only to have it asked again with a slight change in wording and imposition-- as though I hadn't already considered those options when carefully considering what to write the first time.  

It makes me so irrationally furious, literally furious; mind blank with a bright rage, that I've quit each of the programs before getting past much farther than the 4th input box.  I'm getting worked up and angry just typing about it.

Responsibility is all nice, but theres got to be a payoff. Simba has no reason to grow up nor responsibility towards the silly kingdom. There was no threat to his paradise - not even hypothetical one. Thats why not growing up and living like he had was a perfectly reasonable and correct choice. He had no reason to give a damn about some bunch of lions or zebras or trees and stuff. Obviously you will go there to forward an amazing analogy helpful to the lecture itself, but the premise is wrong. There is no worth in taking responsibilities for no reason.

""desert"", ""word"" and ""thing"" in Hebrew have the same root (dalet, bet, reish).  After the Exodus from Egypt, the extended time in the desert was a place of no words, no things... in order to receive the word (Torah) which in the metaphor you bring from the Lion King would be the new rock (tablets) the new institution. The idea of being in the desert for 40 years (bear in mind Israel and  Egypt are quite close!) is that to go from slavery (bound to the enslaving old institution) and to free the mind to renew the new rule of law in freedom, a long internal journey, without ""words""/materialistic ""things"" (devarim) is needed which the desert (midbar) gives.  The journey of the lion cub after the death of the father - the complexity in the story- might be about getting to freedom, releasing from mental slavery that the mind​ tricks of the evil Uncle created...."

The only positive thing he could think of about being carefree and impulsive is teen pregnancy (around 56:30). Really? Is it so bad to live in that framework, and do you really think being carefree and impulsive has no point and use in life? To me it sounded for a moment like Mr. Peterson's shadow is talking there a bit. I am all for ""knowing thyself"" but I have to admit impulsiveness and living for the moment also have their ""use"". Not only in bringing joy, diversity, and creativity to one's life and certainly not only in teen pregnancy (??) but because living in the moment in and of itself sometimes can bring you kind of wisdome and sometimes more wisdome than you could acquire solely by rational thinking."

Its why single motherhood is so problematic at the moment and will continue to be until women start taking some more responsibility as to when and who they have decide to have children with. Its very easy to just blame men and obsolve themselves from personal responsibility but it comes at much too high a cost. Its why women must be held just as accountable  as well, which is evidently nowhere near the case as the state just propogates the supposed values of single motherhood as a just and virtuous cost when the statistics show quite the contrary with regards  to the children's proclivity to lead a productive and fulfilling life."

Try and find a part of Hitler's writings that talk about any other non-aryan with disgust.
Yeah, Zyklon B was used for fumigating pests. It wasn't used on humans. There's no evidence that it ever was used on humans. The holoHOAX is an utter myth used to propagate the zionist state of Israel as well as ensure ZOG's of the world to be immune from criticism.

The neurotransmitter they down regulate is GABA. Benzos, usually high dose lorazepam drips eases the withdrawal symptoms and experience. Lorazepam level doses which would kill a horse. No one knows why. No one knows why we don’t give synthetic GABA(neurontin) to easy symptoms.  Alcohol, for these people, IS their GABA, now. 

Also, they start around 3 days after last drink. No one knows why.  Every other drug, withdrawal symptoms start when the drug leaves the system.

The non stop physical exertion during detox, is unbelievable.  They do not stop moving and struggling during the whole detox experience.

And you are really right, many after 2 weeks of lorazepam drips and being on a vent, they leave the hospital and go and get a bottle of vodka and start all over again.

I don’t know how much Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) there is in the human body. But it has to be about equivalent or roughly about.

""Abstract
In this essay, I am going to discuss the concept of collective memory as a background for understanding Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious only makes sense in the context of some notion of collective memory. This then takes us into a very wide-ranging examination of the nature and principle of memory-not just in human beings and not just in the animal kingdom; not even just in the realm of life-but in the universe as a whole. Such an encompassing perspective is part of a very profound paradigm shift that is taking place in science: the shift from the mechanistic to an evolutionary and wholistic world view."""

UghsOcmNXBrKJngCoAEC,AnotherLover,1504485022241,"The answer to the question at about 1:28:00 that Jordan relates from a former student is quite revealing.  It deserves a book of it's own, methinks.  The question was ""Why do we need the stories?  Can't we just tell each other the archetypes instead?""  That's an interesting question.  It's the type of question you real quick throw out an answer to because it makes sense intuitively that the archetypes themselves are too abstract and the story represents them better than the abstract form.  That's so strange, though.  Isn't it?

It shows us how disconnected we are from abstract ideas.  We think abstractly so often that we think we're pretty good at it.  But in fact, I think, that only appears to be the case because we are thinking abstractly on subjects we know very well.  So those things carry their own stories with them.  We don't know them only abstractly, nor through a simple story, but through life itself, which represents itself to us as a story within our minds.  We don't live abstractly, we live the story.  The abstract is real, but it's not as real as the story, which itself isn't as real as reality.  

You know, Richard Feinman relates in 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feinman' his observation that people don't often understand the abstract ideas they're working with.  He makes that conjecture based on the fact that most of his students can't recognize the phenomena that they're studying at play in real time all around them.  So one of his teaching methods, well, maybe it's more style, was to sort of tell little stories -- not made up tales, but descriptions of encountering the phenomena in real life.  In describing the experience of the phenomena in real life, a story has been created, and by recognizing the abstract in the real you demonstrate your understanding of it.  

So maybe the answer to the student's question is that the abstract doesn't represent reality until you create a story around it.  Stories are reality descriptions as we best understand reality.  They're not separate from the abstract, but the abstract doesn't become real until it becomes a story.  The abstract is real, but it's not as real as the story, which isn't as real as reality, but it's as close as we can come to comprehending reality.  Huh.  That's interesting, you know?

So."

I would like to see the data on global economics and the correlations between the two.....but a couple examples popped in my head immediately that counter that idea: the Soviet Union and Mao China had equality for males and females, but the Soviet Union eventually went bankrupt and it devastated its land (Aral Sea) and some policies at first led to millions of deaths (collective agriculture for example). Mao China had the ""great leap backward""....yes eventually it got its act together under Deng Xiaoping and grew a lot. But both had awful economic growth at times. On the other side, Japan is notoriously famous for its male/female gap in cultural privileges in formal and informal settings  but it has been one of the top world economies for the last few decades. I would say, ""Thanks Marshal Plan,"" but Japan was successful before WWII which made it into an imperial power house. A stable system of law and organization of society are important for economic growth, and equal rights and privileges for women is helpful because it doubles your work force and adds more ideas to society, but to say equal rights is the number 1 determiner of economic growth is dubious.  Show me the data."

""The most unhappy people are liberal men.""  That's the tortured artist effect.  Liberals can be some of the most intolerant, closed minded people -- witness their aggression towards Trump.  They are children throwing a temper tantrum.  They are ""open"" when they are with other liberals, when they are flattered for their openness by other liberals in their self congratulation societies.  Otherwise, they'll tell you to STFU and close you down.  I think there is creativity on the left and on the right.  Nietzsche tried to appeal to the right but he got co-opted by the left.

Or, you have to separate yourself from your own suffering and lie about it fundamentally.

May I ask what's your opinion on Mulan? Does this movie also use an archetype? It seems to me that it does. There are fairytales about a woman disguising herself as a man who is very good in her new role and becomes a successful man. In Mulan, the main heroine saves her battalion. In a fairytale, the name of which I can't recall right now but it was an Arabic fairytale, a disguised heroine becomes the king's (or prince's) right hand. These two heroines get discovered as females, get shunned, and then they become even more powerful and successful. Mulan saves her country, the fairytale heroine becomes the queen of a prosperous kingdom. I was wondering a lot about Mulan and her transitions from and to her female form and the fact that it is not confusing at all. I can't recall a Western myth with the same story, except for the story of Achilles posing as a woman, but it's not the same, is it?"

John Ranelagh writes of Margaret Thatcher's remark at a Conservative Party  policy meeting in the late 1970's, ""Another colleague had also prepared a paper arguing that the middle way was the pragmatic path for the Conservative party to take .. Before he had finished speaking to his paper, the new Party Leader [Margaret Thatcher] reached into her briefcase and took out a book.  It was Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty.  Interrupting [the speaker], she held the book up for all of us to see.  'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table.""  (John Ranelagh, Thatcher's People:  An Insider's Account of the Politics, the Power, and the Personalities.  London:  HarperCollins, 1991.)

JBP always (and rightly) attacks the soviets for their totalitarianism but I think it is interesting to see how a totalitarian approach to neoliberalism affects people in the long term.  I think we are starting to see that it is just as damaging to the wellbeing of it's citizens (lack of health care, lack of affordable housing, unable to buy food or heating, lack of mental care or care for the elderly, blue on blue violence caused by an inability to rise up the dominance hierarchy).

Ugz2qwZefpWqz8ABR_h4AaABAg,- 27,1533342436047,"What's the difference between ""passive avoidance"" and ""something you know and don’t want to look at, so a part of you has put away""?"
Ugx_nsQssgDS30GsevR4AaABAg,Kent Nauman,1533342436060,"See the ""9 dolphines picture"" (https://goo.gl/images/qyBPPN) on the internet then compare it to the Oedipal-Electra complexes.  I was trained in pediatrics and have never found anyone who has counciled a 3-5-year-old child on their infantile castration fantasies.  Rather Freud has placed God in a SCHIZOPHRENIA-god-CASTRATION complex which is analogous to a grilled cheese sandwich which has been dropped onto the floor then stomped on.    God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))
     The schizophrenic spectrum of disorders is deliberate obfuscation in psychiatric theory. SCHIZOPHRENIA is a malicious synonym for METAPHYSICS, SUPERNATURAL, and THE SPIRIT WORLD. This is directly analogous to the N-word being a malicious synonym for Blacks, Negros Afro-Americans.  “Religion” is organized schizophrenia, meaning the supernatural.   On the internet compare ""open vision"" with ""audiovisual hallucination"" to see quickly what I mean.
  I was certified as a back of the insane asylum psychotic by the Florida Board of Medicine which is the highest medical authority in Florida. Stanford University has YouTube videos by Professor of Neurobiology Robert Sapolsky who fills his classes full. His schizophrenia video says that the leading cause of homelessness is not drugs but schizophrenia. The most common symptom of schizophrenia is hearing a voice and the most common voice is Jesus Christ.  Other symptoms include talking to inanimate objects and/or dead people. The Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus fits Dr. Sapolsky's description perfectly.  Acts 9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:  Acts 9:4 And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  Acts 9:5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  Gresham College in London England has a YouTube video on personality disorders where the speaker sudden stops and says ""we cannot have all religious people on antipsychotic drugs."" Under DSM IIIr all religious beliefs were symptoms of schizophrenia however under DSM 5.1 some religious beliefs are allowed so just pew sitting is not enough to make a diagnosis of schizophrenia under DSM 5.1. God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))
     Warning psychiatric theory (PSYCHO the RAPIST) is fraudulent and injurious. Their optimal human being has been found. He is a psychopath who infiltrated the fertility clinics and had ~150 offspring.  When I was in medical school psychiatric class learning about schizophrenia having its onset between 18-25 years, I said what about Moses talking to a burning bush? The psychiatric resident was stunned speechless. When I had just turned 40 years old, the Florida board of medicine revoked my medical license for Axis I schizophrenia (chronic) with the symptoms including believing in the blood of Jesus Christ, smiling and believing in God's Word instead of DSM IIIr. Years later I was in my favorite coffee house when a man came up to me and said that he and his wife both majored in psychology so I said what about Moses talking to a burning bush? He said ""Moses? Oh Yes, a mega-schizophrenic!"" So I went to the public library looked up a book on psychoanalytic theory then looked in the index under God and religion where I found that both were treated as problems in castration. Therefore psychiatric theory has God in a sandwich which I call the SCHIZOPHRENIA-god-CASTRATION COMPLEX.  Do an internet search on ""religion is organized schizophrenia"", ""DSM religion delusions"" and “psychotic religious delusions” to see that I am correctly diagnosed.  God bless you in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ, Kent J. Nauman ex-MD (axis I schizophrenia (chronic))

Ugykb9q7Vy3r7VWPQMp4AaABAg,Oscar Paez,1530664036110,"At 17:03, Freud did say that in the beginnings of his theory but he then realized that memories were not recorded like they happened. In a card from the 21 of September in the year 1897 (number 69) written to Wilhelm Fliess, Freud wrote a famous quote that in spanish goes like ""...mis histéricas me mienten..."" I'll attempt to translate it as ""my histerics  lie to me."" That moment marked the change of Freud's ideas and renounced the idea of the role of trauma, seduction in the development of normal conditions and ""recorded memory"" and adopted  the idea that his patients (especially cases of histeria) had an exuberant production of fantasies like in day-dreaming. He started to notice that under the conditions of psychoanalytic treatment there was in invariable generation and manifestation of childhood fantasies that manifest in instances like in thoughts, dreams and behavior. Maybe Peterson based that claim on Freud's earlier works that focused on catharsis and dealt with trauma. Hope people find this useful.

I am probably wrong but here's how I see it so far:

Our sub-personalities are in a hierarchy. Our ego is the king. Our sub-personalities are like citizens within a country with our ego being the president. We can choose our president to be a tyrant, a push-over or a hero. A tyrant wouldn't learn and would be destroyed from within. A push-over would be taken over by his sub-personalities making him confused and weak. A hero would learn and grow in harmony with his self. Roughly speaking

I'd like to hear about other points of view. Anyone ?

Edit: We externalize what's within therefore governments and how they govern are a reflexion of the majority of its citizens and how they govern their own sub-personalities. That is why it is of great importance that we take responsibility over our Self."

I highly relate to the parenthesis Peterson makes regarding female contraception and the pill. I was on the pill from age 16 to 21, and it's not until I stopped taking the pill that I realized how much it diminished my libido, as I finally awakened to my sexuality. Now, aged 28 and not relying on the pill any longer, I deeply appreciate that I can feel the natural cycles my body goes through, knowing exactly when I'm fertile and when I'm about to have my period, the highs and lows, trusting my body to regulate itself (which it does very well, like clockwork). My long-term relationship with a very laid-back, sexually repressed man, also deteriorated quite fast after I dropped the pill. I truly believe that it was because I was more in touch with my body that I was able to know myself better and allow an encounter with the wonderful man that has since become my husband. We have a wonderful relationship and sexual life. I would not recommend the pill to anyone unless absolutely necessary."

UgiBX13mWdULkHgCoAEC,Malumultimus,1504484865461,"Freud was an anti-scientific political activist who believed in Jewish supremacy. He thought white people were aliens that he could never, ever relate to and that they could never think the way he did. He even thought this of his closest peers and students, if they weren't Jewish. He thought white people were barbarians who would've never accomplished anything had Semitic traditions and people not come to them. He considered his work to be, above anything else, a deconstruction of the West and the Church -- and he succeeded, for the worse. He thought sexual inhibitions were a form of madness and, unlike the idea of every son saving his father from the belly of the beast, he thought every son sought to murder their father. His clique of psychoanalysts were like a cult where no one could disagree with Freud or else be exiled from the group and slandered; he even took some of his peers' women from them as a way of dominating them. My favorite story about Freud is when a man made a deal to have his young daughter sleep with one of his acquaintances and the daughter vehemently refused, and when approaching Freud about the issue, he told the daughter she secretly did want to sleep with this strange man and was lying to herself. Freud is a Fraud and it irks me whenever anyone talks about him or psychoanalysts in general, because they all still revere him despite what a racist, creepy asshole he was. Yeah, we're definitely living in a world Freud helped create, and unfortunately we'll probably never be able to reverse it.

If I remember correctly it is in the conference number 23 that Freud admits that what his patients tell him in analysis, more often than not, it´s not what really happened to them. It is at this point that fantasy takes a crucial role in his theory, because even if we can´t have a photographic memory of what happened in our past we still can dissect this fantasies, after all this constructions are the ones that more or less structure the way in which we may find satisfaction for our libido.

Why is this step necessary? You say it's a clearer way of looking at things, but at what point does the fragmentation stop? Surely, the ""main Self"" has its own intentions, why don't we stop there? Contradictions in intention and mood doesn't mean that each intention is a result of a SEPERATE personality. It makes enough sense to me to say that these contradictions, doubts, self-ruining pathologies, are defence mechanisms in reaction against some highly intense or highly frequent interactions with the outside world. To me, there is no need to introduce an infinite regress of micropersonalities. Unless that was means metaphorically. I understand certain ways of looking at ourselves makes it easier to navigate and sort our minds."

I like your presentation of Freud.  Freud was an atheist but, ironically, his understanding of dreams provides me evidence for God.  There is something greater, more creative than my conscious self at work in me.  This I take to be a spirit or God.  I have had dreams of ornate buildings, of architecture with such complexity and detail, that I could never consciously create.  I am humbled by the experience.  One of the characters in the Brother Karamazov describes the same kind of experience.  Again, this is evidence of God for me, but in an indirect way.  These dreams were horrific nightmares, maybe the work of Satan.  However, I figure if Satan exists, that is evidence that there is also a God.

UggqRUzdTabK1ngCoAEC,BaneClandestine,1504484885425,"A little rant. I do pray you read, and offer any insight. 

I too had discarded Freud for the most part, until I rediscovered probably his most relevant theory pertaining to this modern age, and the behaviors that strangle European people, or rather. The people most harmed via the psychological scars of the Enlightenment.  Side note; that is essentially what Conservatism is, a defense mechanism, birthed from the Terror, no matter how valorous it may be, it is still poor one, not because it is wrong, it is desperately correct, but as  evidenced from its failure to truly conserve anything, as a younger sibling,  sharing the same genealogy of a ruinous ideology. You cannot reason with Terror. 

Right back to Freud. I am speaking of his theory on Thanatos: The Death Drive; or, to discard will to struggle, and preserve. 

Freud spoke of quiescence, that is. To return to that which was prior to the emergence of being; to end struggle. It is not only that the organism(s) is simply suicidal; but now seeks abrogation on its own terms, and will not only erect barriers to prevent 
the possibility of trauma, how to deal with it, but will also resist outside systems that would dissipate the drive to self end. 

In extreme cases of psycho-spiritual damage. The Death Drive & Pleasure Principle will work in tandem. In merrily assisting the organism to achieve its end goal of termination. Bluntly feel good actions are undertaken to assist in dissolution. In Europeans this has manifested in perverse ways, marked often by policy. Be it Political or ""Humanitarian"" or otherwise and this strange invention, this thing they call Progress. 

As ""Thanatos"", or The Death Drive is the inversion of Eros; The Life Drive. We see noted behaviours, particularly, the dissipation of the self. Which today is a uniquely European phenomenon, no other group does this in such a large number. In the discarding of ""self"" there is no longer need to search or maintain links, links to ancestry,  people, or even past practices, nor treasured instruments of bygone institutions. Once a people have been effectively hollowed out, Atomisation, anomie, quickly follow which reduces the costs what would widely be seen as disloyalty in coherent groups. Other pathologies arise, such as in group self-sterilisation, harmful or closed sexual practices, Sexual/Gender confusion, the complementarity is broken, and so on."

I'm a bit confused because it's self-contradicting and I know for a fact most of it is false, if I'm understanding it correctly. I can't help but think I don't understand the slide. It seems read off like nonsensical statements. 

1. It was a world shaped by man for woman. This is seen clearly in the fact that society protected and nurtured women at every corner. Men died in hard labor, men only had the right to work if they supported woman, men died in wars, etc. It's called chivalry. To this day men lack basic human rights that were given to females long ago.


2. What political rights would men have? The right to vote if they owned land and were married? It didn't do much for them in the long run, obviously. Given that males STILL lack rights they have never had which were granted to women. 

2.2 Women who smoked were hard to be found? This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say, even if you are just reading. Watch any old movie and you'll see nearly every woman smoking. All of the older women in my family were smokers. Many of them had short hair as well.

2.3 If universities admitted no female students in the 1900s then how were there any in the 1890s?

3. The authority was questioned all the time and had been for several hundred years at that point. There are dozens of historical occasions in which women rallied and railed against what men do. Many of these things ended with prohibition of alcohol or no-fault esq divorces."

UghClVRTwF3XFHgCoAEC,Annyonny,1504484898643,"Here's a poem I wrote for you, Based Professor P:

I.
Attention! I'm special; my identity isn't what it appears...
My pronouns are zed, zee, zey, zem, xim and xir.
Got that, bigots? Oh, by the way, did I mention I'm queer? 
Gender, that is; but also, I'm gay. Let's be clear:
I'm a cucked chick with a cut dick and a rugged blue beard.
What's that? Triggerers, ""ism""-ists and 'phobics? Oh dear...
...Oh well, I got Orwell; Bill C-16, LOL! Now say I'm not weird.
And literally kiss my fat-shamed, oppressed, victimized, of-colored rear. 
And pay homage to Mr. Steinberg, feminists' best ally who steered
Society toward this radically righteous route of redemptive reconstruction that veered
West, first, to smash the ceiling of glass, at last, then thrice cheered.
For the end of your fucking-a white-male cis-het rape-culture draws near...
II.
...Oh, hi there! It's me, ""Kermit"" B. ""Frog"" here.
Don't worry, boys and girls and interested others, there's no need to fear.
I've studied psychology for 30 plus years.
I've shed, out of passion and manliness, tears.
For such is my love of freedom and speech; it's not mere.
I'm the damn savior of my whole bloody race, my country and my American peers!
So take note, don't let my lecture fall on deaf ears:
To put a wrench in the cog of cultural Marxism's gears,
Don't just ignore the threat as it leers,
Attack it with language -- civilized discourse -- and stickerized jeers."

I only discovered your videos recently but they're already affecting my life in drastic ways, so thank you. There is so much that is taught in schools at all levels which is completely upside-down, and after years of being in the academy and seeing no hope in most 'educators,' I'm glad to see there are still honest people working to generate true understanding among students.

I have been thinking about the content of your videos a lot. I find Piaget's assertion that ""You do not have ideas, ideas have you"" very intriguing, and I find it goes counter to one of the fundamentals of our society, which is that every person is a distinct entity with free will. We do not choose what ideas possess us; it is up to fortune to determine whether or not we hold the correct views. It reminds me very much of Schopenhauer's correction and reversal of Descartes' and Spinoza's thinking: ""With those other thinkers, he wills what he knows; with me he knows what he wills"" (from vol. 1 of The World as Will and Representation). It is truly terrifying to creep up, through slow philosophical inquiry, to the notion that we are not free as individuals. I wanted to turn back from this quest many times because I saw that it threatened to destroy my life. As you've implied if not outright said in other videos, taking away responsibility is basically a death sentence for the individual as it gives way to nihilism.

Yet I do see it as a paradox to take responsibility given the apparent lack of free will. I understand that it is necessary to have, but given our growing understanding of the fact that 'ideas possess us' and the determinism of brain function, doesn't it make responsibility a necessary lie?"

UghQToqAPK5xJ3gCoAEC,The First Lord,1504484472817,"Prof. Peterson, if I understood correctly, there is just one type of intelligence. And that type of intelligence is spread differently within genders and races. I recall there was research that showed  that black people on avarage have lesser IQ than white people. Considering You have said that IQ is partially determining your success in life, is it then possible, that lower IQ of blacks population to a certain degree influenced the fact that so much of black population lives in not so good conditions? Compared to environmental and historical causes, of course, does it have any real impact?
And another question I wanted to ask - I have not watched all Your lectures, so I apologise if it is answered later on - it has been theorised, that people with higher IQ more often go to STEM fields. What may be reason for it?

Ughru46CNRN_G3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948474742,"I must comment on the dichotomy presented between Conservatives and Liberals.   Asia is almost entirely conservative.   Lee Yuan Kew in only a few decades built up Singapore from nothing into a major economic player, and a stunningly beautiful place.  He is a conservative, but to perform his magic he worked very hard to build coalitions comprised of very different peoples....Chinese, Maylasian/Indonesian Muslims and Hindus while simultaneously reaching out to all the business and shipping communities of the world to convince them that Singapore is the place to be, at least on the way to some other place.  

Somewhat similarly, in India, Manmohan Singh, a conservative (he's a Seikh), engineered India's turn from socialism/communism to socialism/capitalism, which he could only do through coalition building.   As a result, about 300 million people have been lifted out of crushing poverty to middle class, and many formerly middle class people are now living quite comfortably.  

It is often said that Asia copies while the West innovates.  I think that is due to the retardation caused by colonialism.  Asia today does innovate, Japan leading the way since the 1960s, and we owe the miraculous invention of the white led  (which is technically blue) to Japan.

Meanwhile I have seen pics of tomato plants in India that outproduce those in the West by about 10 to 1....their all tomato and almost no plant!   I've yet to see these in the USA.   

Meanwhile, in the USA, the Longshoreman's Union has resisted implementation of robotic loading and unloading of containers.....as Ayn Rand pointed out in Atlas Shrugged, it is the Left, not the conservatives, that oppose innovation."
UghHXlxh-ubz_3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948474762,"I must comment:  It is too simplistic to say that people don't have political ideas, but ideas have them.  Typically people adopt political ideas that represent gain and advantage to they themselves and the subgroup in which they commune.  A great example of this egg before chicken situation are the communist revolutions in Russia and China.  In both cases the populations were about 90% impoverished and over-taxed, abused, and caught up in wars waged by overly egotistical warlords.  Those who supported the revolutions were those who expected gain if the revolution was successful.  Yes, they would parrot common revolutionary phrases, but they all knew that such parroting was an act of taking a stand for that which they saw as gain for themselves and their subgroup.  Of course at those times the subgroup was in the majority and the revolutions were successful. You can hardly blame the revolutionaries, though things did not turn out as rosy as they had hoped, but at least day to day existence was relieved of some burden and uncertainty as compared with the past.  

Those opposed to communist revolutions were of course acting to protect their priveledge But in that group, and commenting from the outside, were those who extrapolated that ""rule by the people"" would be corrupt at best, and disasterous at worse, which is how communism turned out.  In the case of those ""extrapolators"" we see persons whose politics was formed by an idea, based in history, regarding how things really are with humans.  

But in any case the ideas of expected gain or loss and frank assessment of human behavior are the source of the choice of political stances."

Ugip8vepTb8kQXgCoAEC,TheMostGodless SinfulBastard,1472948474824,"Prof. Jordan makes: the brain is an extremely complex thing and we don't understand it, I'd would add that there's a group of people specially neurologists and people who take brain scans and such who think they DO understand it, and they say things like ""We don't understand the brain BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW is this or that"" and then they go ahead and make some very far reaching comments or conclusions about it based on what little they say they DO know; and people take that to mean so many things which these experts say or their conclusions and never examine the FACT about it they said they knew, never decide if it is in fact true or not, their particular lingo and phraseology makes it sound deep and certain...

Maybe (in terms of life goals) it's actually important that the idea is more exciting than the completion, so that more goals are continually set. This is the Sisyphus journey he was talking about in this video but combine that with the dopaminurgic systems he explains in other videos and you have a reliable system to keep you on track.

I might have been viewed by many people in my surroundings like I'm a piece of useless garbage, and one who talks back too, but at least they didn't b(reak) my spirit. 

I've had a shit life. My brother(who you could describe as a 3 year older than me bisexual hipster who is possibly becoming a transgender) never actively played with me unless it were games of domination like wresteling -which I won ever since I as 13 and those wrestling matches never happened again since then-, never liked me or ever played with me as a kid. I was playing by myself outside whilst he was doing whatever. I never could convince him. he was acting like a mean dog those days. Confused about his sexuality at the age of 8 or something. fucking wipe.

By the time I was 12 my dad, who always made sure I arrived at school and always came to pick me up (we rode bikes) and owns private a library of 25 thousand books, had a series of medical life threatening problems. To make a long story short, the next 3 years he died 4 times, only to be resurrected by doctors and surgeons who were more often than not the cause of my fathers initial dying. today he still walks around, in agonising pain every day, without one half of his hart, without the muscles in his belly, a lot of scars, and pain in his bones.

when I was 13 years old, I went to the big boys' school. My brother had just left this one as he is 3 years older than me. The kids and teachers remembered him thourougly. I proceeded to instantly attract the biggest bully in town to come and fight me. I was never the kid to shut up when attacked. So after the first few incidents when this bully would come with his friends to me and my newfound group of weaklings and try to intimidate, surround my, hit me or kick me whilst the weaklings would watch and do nothing, and where I would refuse to back down, I managed to claim the weakling throne and thrive. As the months passed and winter came, I was surprised to notice that all the other kids my age in other classes wouldn't talk to me because they were scared they would be bullied too. 

In the middle of winter, shortly after my birthday my dad was at it again. hospitalised, at the brink of death, the usual. As the kids in school would ""fight"" mental battles of dominance to establish an acceptable hierarchy, I was a bit lost since, you know my dad and stuff. My mother was working 5 days a week, traveling to our capital Brussels to do her job, so you can imagine she couldn't spare much time or energy to her sons. She had trouble enough fixing us a hot plate everyday since that was my dads job. I was wearing this old coat from one of my many older nephews to school, rocking a unibrow and as you can imagine, this caused some stiring in the social pot. As for my physical capabilities, I was and still am, a little bit of and ubermensh if you don't mind me calling myself that. I won several sportsmedals in school. My adversaries couldn't be bothered. 

There was this game at school, when one one guy would throw a red coin in the air and yell ""Schooierfight"" which more or less translates to ""Hobofight"" No need to mention I was a pro. In fact, I won so many times, people started getting pissed off at me. The next time I went to play in a little football team at school, this one guy had made up a chant about me. he, and about 200 other kids would ever since then chant: Sander the schooier! du du, du du du, Sander de schooier! du du, du du du.
Which of course was an obvious reference to my silly clothing and poor look, aswell as the game I always won. The teachers wouldn't even try to protect me or try to stop the other kids, but that was probably because they didn't understand what was going on. I never sought help anyway.
 They kept doing that on and of for 2 years, but I refused to go to another school, even though the teachers, who couldn't stand me either as you can imagine where eager to convince my mother I was a morron who had to leave their school. Can you believe it? Only thanks to my father coming to my school once when he was in a better state, I was left the option of proceeding to my third year. He actually threatened some old woman responsible for the school with his cane at some point.

Now this is only a short summary of my life to the point of being 15 years old, and even though I haven't covered the remaining 5 years to describe the utter shitness of my I'm quite sure it isn't nescerary anyway. I think I made my point already.

Life is a piece of shit, and when somebody tries to fuck you in the ass, you have to be merciless and fight back, for if you don't their shit will only start to smell worse, and other people will start dumping their shit right in your face because you're the easy target. Humans and apes, all like their shit flinged to their adversaries."

The issue I have with your point of a distributed ""being"" throughout the nervous system is that the brain alone is what holds the ""being"", one's self. You have been talking in this and the previous lecture about seeing and walking with our spines and I have no reason to doubt the validity of your claims even though I am not a biologist. However, you are talking about sensory ""awareness"" of our bodies (similar to triggering hunger for example) which is not the same as being conscious or alive. A severed limb or spinal cord does not remove one's self even though this condition may ""imprison"" him within his body. All memories and personality traits are stored and manifested by the brain. If the brain dies, the person dies and disappears regardless if the heart or spine remain functional. A transplant would not make me another person; so will not a head transplant. In the latter, I would simply change a body and I would not have access to any personality traits nor experience of the person whom I received the body from. And lastly, a blind person may be able to see because the nervous system is extremely plastic and this is the reason why, most probably, we can learn virtually everything. As always, I love to listen to you and your lectures. Keep up the good work Dr!"

Where by - A small mistake gets applied at the highest level of meaning... 
i did something a ‘good person’ wouldn’t do…therefore, i MUST be a horrible person.

 Although I’ve never been clinically depressed as such, I can see how, taken to an extreme this way of thinking can emotionally dismember a persons life.

""i did something a loving person wouldn’t do… therefore i am unworthy of love.""
'i did something a person in love wouldn’t do… therefore, i am not in love.'
'i did something a ‘good person’ wouldn’t do… therefore i deserve to die.'

Depressed people can be hyper sensitive to perceived criticism - which is I suppose an extension of this over generalization onto ‘the other’.  
Where a small comment / gesture / behavior’ is construed to mean they don’t love me.

is there scope for (or an existent) whole video on this phenomena and how to help point out or counter, when a person is doing this behavior?"

So, on the topic of alcoholism.
My family has a history of at least having fun while drinking.
My dad only needs a little push in order to become an alcoholic.
And I experience a clear dopamine burst when drinking.

However, I can't voluntarily get drunk.
This became clear to me when drinking half a bottle of wine once.
While I got close to being drunk, it wasn't that at all.
I was still able to control myself, kept memories, and didn't even have a hangover. (it was gone after a few hours, including aftermath)

But what I found was that the more I drink, the less I feel the desire to drink.
And after that wine incident I've been drinking so little that after nearly a year, I'm still on the same bottle as I opened shortly before that. (two types of wine)
I can only recall one glass of wine since then as well.

With beer (what I drink pretty much only now) it's quite the funny story as well.
Because I cut down the amount of cans (just the 0%, though) after constantly forgetting that I could still get one that day. (this also being the case for the actual ones)
Even now I constantly forget that I can get one despite drinking just four cans in a week. (reminds me, I can still get one today)

All in all, I should easily become an alcoholic, yet I can't even get drunk voluntarily or drink a beer a day."

Is it that their incentive reward system does not give them enough reason to override underlying exploratory system? And they view socialization as a distraction from whatever activity they'd rather do to actually get from point A to point B on Jordan's diagram? 

For example. Highly agreeable neurotic introvert comes into a bar. She (or he) wants to be liked, and to do that she feels like she need to match other people level of excitement. But she cant do that - her reward system is not up to the task. She freaks out and feels completely paralyzed.

Believe it or not their threat assessment comprehension leads that of men's.  Men act one their threat assessment quickly and more definitively.  However a good deal of quarreling between man and wife is over assigning malevolence to potential friends and acquaintances.  Men tend to be more generous in assuming innocence.  Women are welcoming but with but have layered tests of threat potential that get carried out during many meetings.  Men are more one and done.
UgieRYaiYC21Q3gCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485003796,"Peterson scores with the parallel of emotion pain to physical pain.  Emotional pain shares similar neural pathways with physical pain.  You can literally take an aspirin for a broken heart.  It will really reduce your emotional response, no joke.  It is not marvel, painful confessions or sinful disclosures can reduce stubborn body aches and pains. 

Self-preservation is a proof of evolution?  Huh?  You know what else is proof of evolution?  Your feet are not where your head is positioned and your head is not where your feet are located.   I mean design could account for that but let's just cram in the round postulation of evolution that square peg of justification.

I am so underwhelmed with these dubious evolutionary tests.  If I throw a punch to your face stopping one inch from hitting you, you will flinch.  Now is that because you have a sixty million year fear of disembodied fists as an ape in a tree?  It's called A REFLEX RESPONSE!  It's so funny because Christians get accused of erecting the God of the gaps.   Whenever there is a question that science can not answer, stuff God in there, right?  It seems this exact way with evolution.  Anytime there is something that hints of novelty, just slap evolution on it and call it good. 

This is why Christians call evolution a religion.  It is not falsifiable.  There is always an excuse to overthrow contrary evidence in favor of evolution.  For kiddies who don't know what it means to be falsifiable, it means having the character of a belief that is able to be proven wrong.  Not that it has to BE wrong, but it must have a criterion by which it can be shown to be correct or  incorrect. 

For example emotions are not falsifiable.  You can't prove that someone's anger is correct.  There is not such thing as wrong anger.  Anger is anger.  Some may speak of justifiable anger but even that is arbitrary.  Emotions are not subject to being disproved.   Art is not falsifiable.  Is the Mona Lisa right or wrong? That is not even the right question.  To ask that question is to misunderstand art in the first place.   Now math is falsifiable.  It operates on the principle of equality and balance.  Two plus two equals four.  This can be proven true or false. 

  However  REAL SCIENCE, is falsifiable.  For example you may get blood work that was done poorly and get bad results, but then follow up tests that are more stringent show a different diagnosis negating the validity of the first one."

No, it was not well mapped into neurological circuits, please, professor, do your homework. A very weak lecture... The Big Five  was pushed in the past 20 years into the throats of psychologists but in reality is a rather useless test... They took 2 scales from temperament research, 1 scale from intelligence research and 2 from social compliance characteristics, a bit here, a bit there but missed a lot of biologically-based traits... It is a very poor model but was advertised using all social power of McCrae and Costa, simply was pushed onto the market... Results - thousands were tested with rather empty outcomes, and predictive power is very weak, it can predict only what people already know. Big Five was used by Cambridge Analytica using the Facebook and dating agencies, to collect massive samples, without any consent of participants... Not very professional...

Question though:  Do you think it will ever be possible to understand personality through reductive terms?  From this lecture you seem to be stating that there are a myriad of personality ""subroutines"" that are either running or that we consciously select.  However, aren't all these ""subroutines"" running in concert?  Doesn't each one play off the other and adapt and change based of the actions of other ""subroutines""?

To complicate matters, isn't the whole body doing this?  Or to take it to an extreme couldn't it be argued that  all of nature is running these ""subroutines"" which interact with ours?

Just curious as to what your thoughts would be.

Thanks for the great video!"

So, the way we we are primed by evolution to spot eyes and teeth, you can add claws to that :-). While we were completely focused on the little cubs in a corner of my vision i peripherally 'saw' a big claw sticking out from under the table  behind me's table cloth and in that moment I had one of the most intense and physical fright experiences of my life. Consciously I knew they had some stuffed animals around but for a small fraction of a second that knowledge didn't matter. So thinking about how some of the optic nerves connect 'lower down' probably explains that. What I find interesting is that once I was aware of the specific stuffed adult lion under the table, I didn't keep getting the same fright reaction every time its huge claw entered the edges of my vision. So even though the higher order consciousness is slower it must also somehow suppress some of the baser 'circuits'...?"

In the New Myth of Psychological Man the self would be identified with the observing part of the Ego and not associated with any one single subpersonality - not captured by any one subpersonality.  How would it work with an alcoholic?  The alcoholic would realize one subpersonality wants a drink, one wants to stop drinking.  The Observer, Existential Man,  would choose in that present moment which subpersonality he/she wants to manifest, identify with in that moment.  You don't have to go through the arduous process of not being an alcholic, just choosing in that moment to manifest a different subpersonality, the one who wants to stop drinking - one moment at a time.

Even within the immediate familial environment, a jealous mother or farther will bring you down if you don't fully comprehend human nature and have the ability and fortitude of character to deal with it; simply for the reason that it (true creativity) is so rare, and the great majority of humanity are not!!! - many are competitive, and will see any light as an affront on their status. Learn the arts of War, and commit to fight for your creative pursuit and ownership of what your create. ""The envious hides as carefully as the secret, lustful sinner and becomes the endless inventor of tricks and stratagems to hide and mask himself. Thus he is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of others which eats up his heart, as if he did not see them, nor hear them, nor were aware of them, nor had ever heard of them. He is a master simulator. On the other hand he tries with all his power to connive and thus prevent any form of superiority from appearing in any situation. And if they do, he casts on them obscurity, hypercriticism, sarcasm and calumny like the toad that spits poison from its hole. On the other hand he will raise endlessly insignificant men, mediocre people, and even the inferior in the same type of activities"" : Arthur Schopenhauer, 1788 - 1860...""Know how to triumph over envy and malice. Here contempt although, prudent, counts, indeed, for little; magnanimity is better. A good word concerning one who speaks evil of you cannot be praised too highly: there is no revenge more heroic than that brought about by those merits and attainments which frustrate and torment the envious. Every stroke of good fortune is a further twist of the rope round the neck of the ill -disposed and the heaven of the envied is hell for the envious. To convert your good fortune into poison for your enemies is held to be the most sever punishment you can inflict on them. The envious man dies not only once but as many times as the person he envies lives to hear the voice of praise; the eternity of the latter's fame is the measure of the former's punishment: the one is immortal in his glory, the latter in his misery. The trumpet of fame which sounds immortality for the one heralds death for the other, who is sentenced to be choked to death on his own envy"" : Baltasar Garcia, 1601 - 1658. Notice that this is the way envious people see creative people and their production; a source of power, a source of status fame, glory. Most creative people don't give a fuck about that, they just want to make the world a better place, make the world a little easier, give a little bit more beauty and poetry to experience......a conflict of interest, and one you would do well to study if you a preparing creative things."

But i think is not luck at all, but great social skills and, as you say, the ability to climb up through hierarchies.

The repeat iterative game that does not lead to one owning everything and everyone else owning nothing is free trade and unregulated markets. That is because each individual owns themselves, and their own production, to trade as they wish. This is inalienable, since chattel slavery was abolished.

Unregulated trade only occurs when both parties to the trade want it to happen. If either party, or any party, to the trade does not think they gain from that trade, the trade does not happen. That means with every trade people's wealthy grows. People are better off, poverty is lessened or eradicated.

That's why as governments have lessened their interference with trade, poverty has decreased. Dr. Peterson goes into this with his observation elsewhere that the U.N. goal of ""cutting poverty in half"" was accomplished faster than even the most optimistic projections.

This is because free trade builds on itself, wealth increases faster as time passes and faster the less interference in trade that governments exercise.

That's how even the poorest people of Hong Kong became the envy of the world from nothing in only a couple decades: Maximum freedom of trade."

He is definitely put out there to propagate such thinking but it's really a red herring. He says you can't help coming to a 1% in a system like we have so too bad. He excuses as if it's okay, because it naturally happens everytime. The system is indeed designed against you, but you actually have 0 chance of becoming part of the 1%. Those spots are reserved for the elite families, the cabal families of kabbalist jewish bankers and royal families. The system is the problem and we can do something about it. The answer lies in denying overarching hierarchical power structures. Get rid of the UN and any other big hierarchical institution and keep every governing entity so small that you could have a cup of coffee with everyone in your community. Corruption takes place among strangers and a limited government system would prevent or at least greatly increase the chance of cutting corruption at it's root before it can take hold. It would mean that the human communities would bear more risk and responsibility but with the reward that freedom is more easily conserved should someone or a group try to take more power then necessary. It beats the promise of the dystopian future that awaits us now. The geopolitical drama is all for show. Whats really happening is that your mind is being socially engineered while they build a digital prison around you. Smart meters, wifi, facebook and youtube censuring(the fake news meme), nano chips to even smar toilets. They will see and know everything. The children of dark will rule supreme and if youre a dissident you will be filtered out, the world becoming like a rpg game where when you have the favor of the gods(the elite) youre rewarded and when you don't you're cast into the dirt. And they wil micromanage everything you do, say, think, feel etc. Does that sound like a fun and free future for mankind?"

I AM VERY CONSERVATIVE

   Unless you are talking about European conservatives which are nationalist, I am lost as to how American conservatives have a problem with free trade across boarders??? Or having a strong military and keeping it on the world stage. 

  As for immigration,  it is a great thing! Providing it is done legally I don't see how anyone has a problem with that. 

    Having a healthy boundary around a cell is important at controlling what comes in and out to keep the cell working and healthy. Setting healthy boundaries with your children to establish lines that, if crossed, will result in a consequence, is important and having a line around a country, that is crossed, will result in consequence is also Important. 

      Everytime I hear you say that conservatives are X, I cringed because that is very wrong especially when it comes to immigration and American Constitutional Conservatives that, from what I can see, are Far different from the European Conservatives that are Nationalist and don't like immigration while the European left makes Bernie look like a capitalist."

That's not to say that so-called perceptual versatility is fundimentally defined as occupying other points of view, and meaning is synonimous with contextual significance. You could just as easily call it ascribed value, or whatever type of thing the dictionary says. I suppose it also involves recourse to relativity, communication skills and things that would underly a fancy term, a factor like perceptual versatility. I suppose the real Meaning of meaning itself is Experience? or idk. Love is so beyond us, it seem like it might be a big part, if not all of what keeps things going. With enough perceptual versitility, after all, a mind could perhaps bend to see anything as a manifestation of love. What a tricky idea tho, maybe there's another word for that, but it sounds about right. It just seems like an easy term to get carried away with.

He's downplaying the one percent thjng as if it's something that happens naturally, but the monopoly analogy is incorrect because he implies that all players play fair. It would be more correct to say that the elite(globalists) desigend the monopoly game and put themselves at the top of it and decide who gets to bend the rules(pe masonic initiation) basically creating a glass ceiling effect and jordan obviously has passed the glass ceiling otherwise he wouldve been censured long ago. What people dont realize about the conspiracy is that the social marxist movements were never meant to last. Theyre there to scare people into the new world order which will be a kabbalist christian technocratic dystopia. Do you understand now why jp is promoting christianity, family and downplaying the role of the ""1%""? The elite are trying to social engineer society and all victimized males in the world will now lean towards a state obedient christian family unit. If you dont believe me then ask yourself this. Do you really think jp wouldve had a career wherein he taught at harvard if he wasnt in with the conspiracy? The big universities are notorious elite initiation gauntlets and chabad lubavitch(the elite jewish end times cult that is running the end times prophecy fulfilment part of the conspiracy) has had harvard in their pocket for decades!

Specifically, telling creative people to find a (non creative) way to make money and do your creative stuff on the side. Reality isn't necessarily even nearly as grim as he makes it seem, if you're willing to look for something outside of your certain creative niche that scratches the same itch.

I spent my teens / early adult years trying to make music as a career. When that seemed hopeless, I learned to paint and I'm now working as a concept artist in the film/gaming industry. And the demand for creative people in this industry (animators, programmers, 3d modellers etc) is enormous. The revenue generated from these industries is also enormous.

Obviously some products are much harder such as social networks or things like trello or inventing a new personality test or creating a new english certification, those are all things that benefit from many people already using them. For most other products the best strategy, after the free trial which only works for software, is to spend money marketing the product by giving it to influencers and paying them to promote it, be it beauty products, clothing, a new car brand, new computer hardware company... but this is VERY expensive and can still be incredibly hard.

It's not just a matter or hard work or of opportunity. Those things are essential, of course, but it's also the predisposition to intelligence and creativeness that affords us success.

Narratives that don't include this natural bias are flawed. The concepts of the ""American Dream"" that implies hard work is the only factor needed to gain success or the Communist idea that equity in distribution of resources will resolve discrepancy and corruption both lack the insight into the way our nature trends towards. So recognition in your own shortcomings and your own advantages can help unravel the extremes of dogma and instead focus on the immediacy of your own journey to a relative success, bounded by your own definitions. Underpinning all of this is liberty –both personal and social– that allows your to creative a narrative. If you aren't scoring 60 on the CAQ, maybe it means you won't be the next creative genius, but it certainly doesn't stop you from writing a poem or a novel, designing your new living room, or inventing solutions to your problems.

This allows the standard of the builders and contractors and rule of law, to still take a meaty portion of society monies, but the taxation, also allows permanent and low income to artists. i.e., 20 -30k Easily. Which is very livable. 
He is right this comic world of theft, takes everything and your soul and kills you. Met a famous potter, he made on average 6k a year. I made in the last ten years, under 100k in a first world country, about 3k-8k a year, that covers food, and rent. This allows no mate, no future, but I discovered many things.  Not completely lazy, because I sid it was an average, I did do work and work up north, the most I made n one month was 17k. Some years, I made nothing paying for my student loans. So our nation is under attack and swarmed by people that are not our people. I ma fucking tired of this inclusive nature, while they steal knowledge to pervert it towards PRIVATE and teach Private ownership and control of al things, create a very unkind society. SO i think He is still off.

Greed the plan of ruin. 

Coming out of a violent commerce war. The assets of the republic were devastated and stolen. Now the world has adopted HItler societies and destroyed a society built on honesty and love. HItler used the government to profit from his book, clearly there is no virtues invested in him. Then we have all the reverse psychology today forcing people to run into capital predators and allowing their children to fall prey to large sexual markets filled with some sort of sickness.

UgiUefe7Ob71YHgCoAEC,HighKailash,1504485018573,"Interesting that the thing you seem to be most adamant about (find a way to make money then practise your craft on the side) is the thing I disagree with you on the most. I'm almost 30, an artist, and tried to find something else to do as a career until a year ago. I went on various courses, between different jobs, ending, ironically with the first year of a Psychology degree which left me unsatisfied and frustrated. I was absolutely miserable when I was spending my time focusing on other things because I am high in conscientiousness so I felt that I had to put all my effort and focus into them, leaving me with nowhere near enough time to do my art. Now I'm studying illustration and animation and have never been happier in my life. I have a true sense of fulfilling my purpose and I experience profound feelings of meaningfulness.

I think maybe your strategy may work for some people, but for me and perhaps people like me, it didn't help. Then again maybe I just didn't find the right job to make my living, which is another difficulty. Maybe life will be difficult for me, although it seems like the animation and comic book industry are at least somewhat better to find work in than if I'd studied something like fine art. I think I would rather be poor and happy than rich and miserable though."

That was right after college, I ended up leaving that company out of boredom shortly after and got into the controls automation world. Later I had Kodak fly out after a couple months as working as a controls engineer to explain to them how you could have a manufacturing machine auto calibrate and that it would be faster and more accurate.

UggZEidYCDQYxngCoAEC,anab0lic,1504485024129,"As someone who had extraordinarily high levels of creativity as a teen and in my early 20's I'm not so sure it was because I got lucky genetically, I believe its 100% down to the things I grew up doing from a very young age to a young adult.   And i bet if you were to study the childhood of other people that grow up to be highly creative they likely spent large amounts of time doing similar things that developed their brains in ways that creative people are lacking.

Also, my creativity is no where near what it once was  (although still higher than the average person it would seem)  and i believe that to be because I don't spend much time these days doing the things that built it and are most likely also required to retain it.   I was literally like a human idea factory that could generate idea upon idea and then take those ideas and sculpt them further into better ideas, or combine ideas that already exist into greater ones.... all in my head visually effortlessly.    It gave me a great sense of humour as I was always thinking outside the box in ways my peer group couldn't and then transfer my thoughts into language that would create amusing visual images in others minds. 

However,  It also had negative affects on my life that other highly creative people may be able to relate to. For instance in social situations I could likely conjure multiple bad outcomes in my imagination that would be of a very vivid nature and make you hesitant to proceed for fear of them becoming reality, , which gave me social anxiety issues.  Id often put my thoughts into others heads thinking they were thinking the same.  Also at times my mind just wouldn't 'shut up' hard to relax and fall asleep when my brains just constantly generating new and interesting thoughts in my head or ones that are bad and cause worry.   Insane, often times horrific and violent nightmares have also been commonplace for me throughout my life, but there has also been many nights where I've had dreams that were so good I wish they were a reality.   I used  think some of my dreams were so unique and original if expanded upon would make for great movies.

I am curious to know if i were to partake in what i believe to be creativity building exercises again would my mind return to its former ways.... its an area I have much interest in as for both personal gain - as its incredibly rewarding to create things of value in the world (even when not paid for it) but also helping others do the same.

Ugz1TNMIJarMxz5yt5R4AaABAg,Baleur,1534206369364,"19:40 maybe industriousness is a random ""lucky"" mutation that happened thousands of years ago (closer to 20.000 years if we adopt the new discoveries in Göbekli Tepe, the water erosion of the Sphinx basin, and others), which in turn lead humanity to spark civilization.. Perhaps the animal kingdom doesnt have the same form of industriousness as we do, and thus they never spark a civilization, because no matter how intelligent they may be, at any ""free time"" after taking care of survival needs, they merely play or rest as this is most evolutionarily beneficial, to stay safe and rested.

But humans, we have an urge to build, to expand, to reach higher, for no other reason than because the urge exists.
Sure one might say there is a civilization-aspect of darwinism where the urge to develop civilization and technology IS beneficial for the species, thus could be included in an even longer-term overarching meta-darwinism theory, not entirely based on organic evolution but also social/technological evolution.

So its interesting to think about. I mean lets take dolphins, what if we gave dolphins arms, hands, opposable thumbs and the ability to be amphibians (survive on land, for a time). Would they use their supposedly near-human intellect to suddenly give rise to a new civilization? Or would they merely do what they already to, but on land?
My point is, the level of intelligence and the possession of tool-using limbs isnt necessarily automatically sparking civilizations.
It may be something else, a random ""spark"" in the persona of the species that is needed, such as industriousness.
Some new seratonin-trigger that has nothing to do with pure organic darwinian survival, but some random lucky mutation that leads to a reward stimuli if something ""productive"" is done, which in turn over time and in larger scales lead to civilizations.

This almost echoes some old Star Trek episodes, where you had whole species of humanoids of distant planets living like primates, but in complete bliss and happiness, without any comprehension of WHY anyone would want to explore space, develop a civilization or even build cities. Their brains simply weren't wired to comprehend those concepts or even desire them.

This is something difficult for us to imagine, because we're so fixed in our own perspective (obviously, we are what we are).
But as a random example, what if another interstellar civilization came across our planet and were absolutely gobsmacked, surprised and in complete disbelief of what we were doing.
Because, perhaps we had no expression what so ever in our entire civilization of something that THEY have always considered absolutely vital and important for their entire existence throughout millions of years, and in their own self-centered view they assumed that any other intelligent lifeform must also adhere to the same concept.

In that light, heck, perhaps industriousness is NOT needed for a civilization to start.
Perhaps, as unlikely as it seems to us, even interstellar civilizations can arise completely devoid of industriousness, due to some lucky accident in their society structure or way of being, that simply inevitably leads them to build ""up"" and explore space.
Not due to industriousness, diligence or curiosity, but just out of pure automation of striving for the survival needs of their species.
Its easy to think of an ant-hive in this example, but perhaps something with more individuality is also possible in that sense."

Since each neuron is made from multiple atoms, and each atom is made from multiple sub-atomic particles, it's impossible for there to be more neurons than sub-atomic particles.

Ugw7rAt3XWKFiSh1bQJ4AaABAg,Rick D.,1530663971527,"Cobinatorics and networks is the idea that a relatively small group of interacting agents can recombine in a surprisingly large number of ways. Space is not an empty stage and it is not an ether it is more like a nested hierarchy of action. The discrete bits are precise ratios of a quantum of action. Dimensions don't exist before action and not all dimensions are equal. This must be some kind of decision engine generating novelty with the fuel being something like the difference between harmonic regularity and self referential noise. Every engine takes advantage of a difference and we may not be able to name this difference. The big bang could be a large scale phase transition in state space. Each step in the process has some range of choices and when the choice becomes too fine grained (criticality at the edge of chaos) it is the chaos that drives the choice one way or the other. This is a random walk, the testing of state space, the measuring of value.
All value is not equal and it is the network or range of associations that controls or decides what is valuable and what is not. The result is increasing levels of sophistication. The idea that value exist in state space and must be measured and located for some purpose suggest consciousness is behind all of this activity."

So i'll say thiz,  if we take anything from which we can take something tangible it would be thiz hypotheziz.  The reazon the collegez have become breading groundz for toxic radical idiology can be related directly to the lack of intrezt young people show in college settingz to studiez where All material prezented to the student iz factual and not so much opunion bazed.  In other wordz before you Mr. Peterzon the world waz in a disarray of ignorance running a muck.  And so after your online debu4e and your explozion it feelz like the peicez are falling back into place, a connection one might make iz  that all of theze people that have latched (im holding on strong) on to you are the onez who thought college iz a waste of time, becauze they were not in college or elze they would have known about you and alzo the onez that couldnt be forced to attend and thatz a huge number.  But the reazon why they watch,lizten hear, attend read what you say itz becauze itz factuall, it can ne weighted, meazured, touched in some  way or another.  And we didnt know how much of a school setting reprezentz an official sanctuary of knowledge and thiz eliminatez all doubt of credibility and we can learn with a silent mind, focuzed.  The correlation between radical sjw pc identity politicz run amok waz one can say or hypotheziz iz when the education level of the general population fallz    xx' amont of yearz behind  what the current level of education iz in the country'z universitiez  there will be an uprize in the agrrezivnez of demandz a small group of people will be making agianzt the majority of the population and to achieve that their demandz are enforced they will demand changez to a conztitution bazed on idiology and idiology only and make claimz of irrelevance on groundz of date.  The problem ofcoarze iz the radical media will exploit theze people have them do their dirty bitting becauze thiz small group of radical individualz they themslevez are ignorant in the sciencez of modern day institution, and people like that are motivated by ego and require will not prezent proof or fact, and that manifeztz itzelf in our world with the dizrezpect of an entire population without any precedentz, like we see today.  So I believe there can be valuable information if one can extract the proper data.  Becauze after you Peterzon I realized how stupid and lazy I waz mentally and im sure im not the only one.  So next time thiz happenz make sure you tell you other not so brave collegez that it iz there moral obligation to put an end to any type of ignorance that might be poizioning the country if one of the claimz being made by a radical group  contradictz factual knowledge.

UgzHRHWQ2QYckehRdBJ4AaABAg,Integral Stanley,1530663973041,"I have been loving taking this course and wanted to share my notes in case anyone was interested. Jordan Peterson is an interesting professor of psychology. He was formerly a professor at Harvard and is now at the University of Toronto. He is unusually well accepted by many people. He obtained a grant to film two of his courses and has over one million subscribers to his YouTube channel. He gives public talks. Tickets sell for $60.00 to $100.00 each and he sells out major venues.
       Jordan tells us our personality is extremely complex. We are likely the most complex thing in the universe. We will likely never fully understand such a complex thing as ourselves and psychologists have made a good start. In this class we will study many important psychologists such as Jean Piaget, Carl Jung, Freud, and the psychologists of humanism, existentialism, and phenomenology. Although these psychologists focus on different aspects of the personality and sometimes seem to contradict each other each one is useful because they address a different part of our complex personality. 
       Transformations are best understood as learning or the results of learning. They represent a significant change in our thoughts, attitudes, behaviors and ability to live well. This course speaks directly to educators. 
This course also includes the detailed study of the big five personality traits. These traits include:
Extroversion
Agreeableness
Conscientiousness
Neuroticism
Openness to experience
       In terms of education an important point to remember is to help students and ourselves to benefit from the use of our strengths and to develop our needs."

I was born into a terrible situation, a marriage already being torn apart by a workaholoic, alcholoic, abusive, absentee father and a mother who fled with me and my sister into a religious cult. Me and my sister were raped. My mom abandoned us with my father, got a divorce and became transient only to show up into our lives to make empty promises and cause drama. We were poor. We farmed and hunted our Grandfather's land while living in a two bed camper trailer. We bought unlabeled dented cans from the super market. Before school age me and my sister would be molested by other people again. My dads brother was drunk piece of shit he would show up molest my sister start fights with my dad and usually get his head busted open. My earliest Christmas Memories were of my uncles head getting smashed through the glass door on our trailer. My dad was a harsh man and hard to get along with but he rarely beat us just yelled alot. He always used a belt even though it was metal studded. Things actually got worse after I started attending school. I was given an I.Q. test and turned out to be a genius. While all the other kids were let out to recess me and a few others were hauled into the library to complete extra assignments. I was doing 2 page book reports by second grade and read the lord of rings trilogy and Moby Dick in 5th grade. My behavioral problems started manifesting early and by sixth and I was already out of control. I was selling cigarettes and booze out of my locker by seventh grade and was in fights daily with every clique in school. I still hold the record for spending 193 days  in school supension   i.e. study hall, detention. I had tried to hit a student with an unopened can of Sprite but almost got a teacher instead. Soon my run ins with the law would start. I was hated for my intelligence and my awkwardness. Constantly being bullied at school and abused at home. I had two misdemeanors and a record before turning sixteen. I worked but couldn't keep a job for more than a year at a time. At this point I was a drunk. I ran away at seventeen 3,000 miles away and lived in a flop house with a revolving rouge's gallery of kids and misfits. We would constantly have the cops called on us. Trust me we were deserved it. A gang moved in and started bullying us. I watched as they drug my friend down the sidewalk kicking and punching him till he quit moving. We rushed him to the hospital he stayed there in ICU for five days. I was forced to ''work'' for the gang. The ''jobs were not pretty''. I still think of those people I hurt trying to save my own worthless hide. This went on for a number of years. Moving back I screwed living with my dad lost my girlfriend and ended up on my transient moms couch begging for death. I was 22. I had tried to hang myself a few years before so this time I tried overdosing pills and booze. I ended joining the military with the thought that I would be worth something to someone if I could just hold it together long enough to get killed in combat. I tried to join the infantry but after my ASVAB scores came back my recruiters would have none of that. I joined as an electronics engineer with a secret clearance. I thrived in the Army doing well at first but the strain of P.T. began tearing my body apart. I knew I could be put out if I said anything so I just ignored the pain. I eventually deployed not knowing I was about to turn the darkest corner of my life. I would be witness to several individual murders and two high body count massacres. One of those was the Hassan Fort Hood massacre. I got an honorable discharge and moved on. I worked whatever jobs I could. I ended running a afoul of a reproductive abuser who raped a baby out of me and tried to kill me more than once. I ended up in the glass house (Mental Ward) I was diagnosed schizo affective Bipolar disorder aggravated by PTSD. I was given pills and a small check and booted out onto the streets. I lived in homeless shelters and veteran programs. One night I had a flashback and broke a window on a house trying to get in looking for a radio to call for backup, backup that only existed in my mind. I caught a charge and became a felon. Nobody would hire me. I exiled myself to a shitty apartment only interacting with people through my computer for the next six years. I tried to kill myself two more times after that. Don't worry at the tender age of 35 my body is to broken to be threat to anybody. I live a lowly existence with no money and no prospects. I am the wasted potential. I am not a victim I did all this to myself through poor choices. Last year and this year I have changed all that. I reconciled with dad who quit drinking and subsequently became less of a prick. I work everyday 10 hours or as much as my body can withstand (secretly alot more than I can stand) on his land for room and board. I quit drinking many years ago. I saved up my little check and bought two acres of land and financed a portable building. I own my own land a ''house'' and a truck that I lovingly put lot of work into. It has given me the confidence to even try to talk to some ladies. I am now ready to grow up. Don't be me. Think hard before you act."

Considering that humans are (very) social animals and that people drift without an aim to serve their communities or humanity tend to swirl into depression, could it be possible that industriousness is somehow correlated to how people are socialized or at least to their conditioned or hard-wired social lives?

Context:
I am a very asocial person by nature (I avoid crowds and social environments as if they were a threat to my life, this has brought a great deal of remorse and melancholy to me) but at the same time, I have an overwhelming capacity to admire, love, and care for people (my friends) individually and when it comes to getting work done I almost can't because I hesitate like mad until it's almost too late and my desire to do but inability to trust myself to (do) tears me apart so I spend most of the time getting to the work than the actual work itself.

My scores @understandingmyself.com:
Extraversion: High (moderately) — which, if I understand, implies at least the desire to socialize
Conscientiousness: High (moderately) — I usually know exactly what, when, and how it needs to be done, I love constructing workflows / plans.
Industriousness: Low (alarmingly!) — and this I think stems from my confliction with the desire but inability to socialize. This score completely sat me on my ass.."

It isn't true by a long shot. It is in fact true that there are more sub atomic particles within a single neuron than a neuron has connections to other neurons. Meaning that there are more sub atomic particles in your brain than there are connections between neurons in your brain alone. I believe that the original quote is that ""there are more connections in your brain than stars in the universe"" but even that is not true because chances are that there is a lot more universe out there than we actually know. To say that the number of connections is larger than the number of currently visible stars may be true...maybe."

Ugzil0KUa4QuRhxHgY14AaABAg,saracrislimalourenco,1520123193487,"More often than not, I study for exams the day before (average of 10h/day, like Prof. Jordan B Peterson mentioned... what a coincidence) and I've I graduated with an average of 16/20, which was the target I was aiming for. I work a full-time job during the day and I was having anxiety problems. I went to therapy and came up with a plan: not going to classes and studying the day before. It was the best decision I've ever made in my life.  

There are exceptions to the rule... For instance, I was pretty much clueless about math before college. Of course I had to study a bit more in order to understand differential and integral calculus. I attended zero classes of calculus because I was just way behind and felt I was wasting my time. Instead, during my vacation time (total of 2 weeks), I studied every day for an average of 4 hours/day, by myself, and got 15/20. Not bad. Finance courses usually require a day and a half of study. Logistics, 2 days. But you get the point, theoretical courses require a day of study, others may take 0.5-1 day extra, on average. (Btw, when studying for finance, logistics, accounting... I always do the math on Excel, because it's faster that way and if there's something I really dislike is wasting my time). 

So... This is probably bad advice to many people, but it worked for me. It is important to note that when I study, I really study, I don't just memorize and forget everything in a couple of days. I feel like going to classes is a waste of time. I can understand the class material in 0.5-1h at home, alone, but each lecture consumes 3h (!!) of my day. This is precious time I can spend learning other things (like listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures on YouTube...) or simply enjoying time with my family; focusing on my hobbies; relaxing; etc."

However, if I was in the room, I would feel embarrased a little by such approach, since it would trigger my mind from ""observation"" to ""conversation"" mode (like we normally nod and look into eyes to let our opponent know that we are listening); that feels like unnecessary effort.

Civilization was not constructed by a ""democratic process"" with respect to personality. Those who decide our laws, who decide to divide the world into squares regulated by traffic signals, and so on are not going to be representative of the total pool of human personality. A subset of of personalities create the available niches in society since humans construct their own environment now, in other words. This would have a lot of applications - such as understanding a lot of mental illness and personality disorders, which I'm sure result at least partially and at times from environments constructed by personalities that do not provide the right niches, or only dysfunctional niches for much of the rest of the population.

There also needs to be more discussion of how the environment itself shapes and regulates personality. Nature/nurture is fully applicable here. Humans do not exist in any meaningful way apart from an environment.

UgxP5IVLmO_sqD_bAEl4AaABAg,Mark El-Deiry,1515025606345,"@19:28 - @JordanBPeterson - Professor Peterson, you state that you have been unable to find a lab measure on which industrious people do better. This relates to an observation I have recently made about myself and it seems like I've observed this same phenomenon in others - I personally am FAR more industrious when I am presented with a personally specific motivation; even more so when that motivation is emotionally significant (for instance, I am far more motivated by intellectual and philosophical challenges/discussions than I am motivated by money) to me.

I have seen this in many others as well. Give a person a task that he or she is personally motivated to complete, and that person will work tirelessly to get it done. In my observation and understanding of people, I would say that most people are motivated by a specific, personal, narrow range of subjects based on their combination of experiences, environment, and disposition.

Whereas people who normally test as more generally industrious seem to be ""driven"" or motivated by a broader, more general, impersonal interest to excel at all endeavors.

Relating that back to your difficulty with finding a lab measure for industriousness - is it possible that the variation in industriousness necessarily disappears in this artificial environment because all people are equally motivated to be as industrious as possible because they know the importance of the study?

Might it be possible to overcome this difficulty by designing a lab measure where subjects are not told that they are being tested for industriousness but are being tested for another trait or characteristic and then seeing whether their industriousness covaries more closely with their separately confirmed levels of industriousness? In fact, if my theory is correct, this might be most pronounced if people are specifically given a task to complete which does NOT personally motivate them. Those who are more industrious will remain motivated to excel because of their need to excel at all things whereas those who are less industrious are likely to be unmotivated and display that through being less industrious in doing a task they do not find motivating.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this theory and this approach to a lab measure for industriousness."
UgwYT-N3Hj9dIeM9aPl4AaABAg,Mark El-Deiry,1515025606349,"@15:01 - @JordanBPeterson - Professor Peterson, about ""orderliness"" and conservatism... has there been a study done to tease out whether orderliness tracks more closely with social conservatism than it does with political conservatism?

Personally, I am not very orderly by disposition (I swear I've started cleaning my room! AND... it has helped! Thanks for that!) and I consider myself a libertarian. Which is to say I am very socially liberal (if it doesn't affect me, do whatever you want - drugs, same-sex marriage, etc) and fairly conservative in what I believe government should control or offer to its citizens (small budget, non-interventional foreign and military policy, less controls on market forces outside of criminalizing fraud and abuse).

My suspicion - or hypothesis - is that orderliness will track more closely with social conservatism because orderly people do not want society to function differently from how it has traditionally because that is well known, well established, and ""safe.""

Has there been any study of this issue? Has there been any study of political viewpoints other than liberal and conservative?"

Ugwnr-oOzgeWPULzeN14AaABAg,AbsoluteGuppy,1512347211655,"So that ""more connections in your brain than subatomic particles"" statements set off my bs alarms, and looking in to Edelman's work, I found Peterson's statement to be a bit misleading. The number of POSSIBLE connections are greater than the number of particles ((number of neurons)! -  so with billions of neurons that number is enormous, but not reflective of real life). Basically, if a message has to get from A to D, it could go from A to B to D, or it could go from A to C to D, and with the number of neurons in a brain, it is pretty much guaranteed that the paths taken by the same message in two different brains won't be the same, because there are more possible paths it can take than particles in the universe (assuming the brains are identical, which brains never are).

TL;DR, Everyone has a unique brain that processes info differently.

(As a side note, I dislike comparisons ""to the entire universe"" because we don't know everything in the universe. We can make predictions, but there's no way to be absolutely sure.)"

Probably I'm quite intelligent, I can learn really fast, I promote quickly in every job that I have so I can mess it up because I'm probably not suited for managing people and most of all managing my own time at work.

""The complete hardcover version of the textbook can be bought used (the actual textbook is a selection of readings from this book).

But perhaps more valuable is that you can you can find pdfs of many readings on the course website (the URL at the beginning of this video is out of date, but you can find it on JPs website under courses, psych 230). These articles are associated with the various lectures in this lecture series (and probably are enough to contextualize the lectures, even if you don't get Rychlak's book)."""

There's about 70 sextillion stars in the  observable universe, our brain has a mere 100 trillion synapses, now for the unobservable universe, we have no idea, and each star contain a huge number of atoms, which in turn each contain some subatomic particles. To say that we have ""more patterns of connections in our brain"" is just false.

Ugh_yW7ED5oprHgCoAEC,Matt Varela,1504484853089,"01. Introduction

- change in personality is commonly known as learning …factual learning and how to perceive and behave

- clinical psychologist of the first half of the course
        - the nature of the implicit structures that shape your perceptions
        - the implicit structures that shape your behaviours and how they are integrated in relationship to your negative emotions, health and wellbeing
-  thinkers of the second half
        - laying out the structure elements of those features (negative emotions, health and wellbeing) and relating them to the underlying mechanistic phenomena …this is making the assumption that there is a relationship between your personality and the manner in which your brain functions.

- metanarrative to learn …knowledge is not memorisation, but creating a cognitive structure that enables you to better conduct yourself more properly in life.

- wisdom …your capacity to understand yourself 
        - so that you don’t find too much of a intolerable mystery of what you constitute
        - to understand others and being able to predict their behaviour, understand their motivations, negotiate with them, listen to them and formulate joined games with them so that you can integrate reasonably well with another individual or group.

- big five trait personalities …implicit structures that govern your perception
        - happiness/extroversion
        - neuroticism …related to composed negative emotions  (anxiety, sadness, depression, etc.)
        - agreeableness …polite, noncompetitive, cooperative, self sacrificing for others, compassionate people that doesn’t like conflict (women score highly across cultures)
        - conscientiousness …diligent, industrious, orderly people (orderliness is associated with disgust)
        - openness …creative, intelligent people that welcome new information and are interested in aesthetics, fiction, arts in general.

- personality is not necessary inside you, humans are a multilevel being “is your mother more a part of you than your arm?”"

UghJqGuia3ypnHgCoAEC,Волибор Заставкин,1504484853227,"1.
In order to learn to speak English like native speakers I must learn to think in English before. The technique for that is very simple. When I'm walking in the street I should begin to think in English without translating my thoughts in Russian. How can I achieve that? Well, I must start with a simple sentence like that: ""I want to think in English"". Then, if nothing comes to my head, I must repeat the sentence. I must repeat the sentence while some other sentence will come to my head It may be something like that: ""I want to think in English but how can I do it? I know some words and I can connect the words to each other. What words do I know..?

2. 
Every day I can begin with the sentence: I want to think in English. I have to imagine a way of the thinking process in which I could go in different possible directions for some minutes. Every good step that I will make will be noted as a new level in the game. For example, the first point is: I want to think in English. The second may be: everything, what I need for thinking, is time. How much time can I spend for this kind of thinking per day? It's a good question. If I want to get a good result it must be one or two hours at least. How can i organize it? How much time do I spend for the internet every day? If I could use half of this time for thinking, I would get enough.

3.
I want to think in English. Where would I come today? Where would I come in a month? In a year? If I think every day trying to write down the process of thinking and focusing on some issue within a month, I will be able to figure out what thinking in English is like. If I concentrate on the issue during a year, I will be able to use English in the process of thinking without efforts. What prospects does it offer? I will be able to listen to everything that I can find on the internet in English. It is the same with reading. Also I will be able to write. It gives me an opportunity to communicate with everyone I want. I can master thinking everywhere. Every free five minutes I can get to it."

We are now several generations og children sacrificed on the altar of industrial production and growth (money as the ultimate good!). We have turned our women/mothers into industrial slaves (liberation!?), valuing material goods over essential family values and the emotional health and well being of the next generation (rebirth). We are truly living in the corpse of the dead culture. The narcissist generation of Baby Boomers, most of whom should never have had kids, since they didn't bother to take care of us (emotionally), instead buying us off with toys, while not bothering to spend any time with us, teach us anything in life (the job of institutions!?) or even listen to us. Treating us as a nuisance to be fed and put in front of the TV or computer and then in bed.

Most ppl I know in my own and following generations) are completely lost and broken in so many ways. We are unprepared for and unable to live our lives, just barely staying afloat. The older generations have hoarded all the ""real estate"", leaving nothing for us to start our own lives.  We are rapidly descending into utter chaos, Collapse of civilisation once more, a new Dark age.
Don't mess with mother nature!

Through these courses I'm finally able to resolve and understand a lot of things about myself, my family, upbringing and all the loss and pain I felt throughout all my life. Most of my friends are in a similar situation, having been abandoned to institutions (the grand experiment!), being completely alienated (or hostile) to their own family. 

My parents could only talk down to me and criticise everything I did, to the point I just felt like giving up and not even try. 
Fucking bastards. I often wished they would die, sooner than later. A sad state of affairs! 

Time to reclaim myself, my soul, health and personality - face the chaos, captain hook and escape from this prison of the mind.
These courses give me courage even though they make me cry...!

It appears that now they are now committing genocide in the Eastern Ukraine? I understand that living in Canada with many millions of Ukrainians whose ancestors were collaborators during the WW2 and therefore have some bitterness and resentfulness towards the USSR. I have not researched the topic of 6,000,000 dead during Golodomor but it appears that there is some evidence that the cause of death was not hunger but some sort of epidemics. Example of Leningrad comes to mind. The German siege of Leningrad lasted 900 days from September, 1941 to January, 1944. During that time 800,000 people, nearly a third of the population at the siege's beginning, starved to death. Roughly one in three. That is in a city! I was born in Belarus and it would be impossible to starve during the summer!!! Stinging nettles soup and other vegetables would be available no problem. This is something for you to investigate and agree or not. You sound like Goebbels and a hate preacher when you talk about the Russians which is not very professional. I would love to engage in discussion with you as I have great respect for you and your lectures are really good. Kind regards, Sergei P.S. Kulak - means a fist in russian to have that idea of grabbing from the poor. It could well be that those guys were sent to Siberia to actually develop it not to die. If you notice now Putin spends much effort to develop Siberia and even gives away the land for free! In my opinion kulaks were a necessary sacrifice. My ex-partner-mother-of-my son is a granddaughter of kulaks. The story is that they lived an amazingly prosperous life in Siberia. Taiga with animals, berries and mushrooms gave plenty.

I spent all of college trying to figure out how to create new businesses, and all of the ideas flopped. Now i work a stable job at a large corporation, but i work on my creative projects on the side. One of my flops is thousandcents.com, an online community for cryptocurrency that i wrote from scratch with PHP. I was hoping to make a large community and do that for a living. I studied business at college, but later learned web dev on the side, since i thought itd be an easy way to start a company with no startup cost. Now i work as a supervisor/full stack web dev, so i have stability, and am also learning a skill that helps me in my entreprenerial projects while at work. It took me so long to figure this all out, but peterson nails it directly in this vid. Ppl who are finding him who are young are blessed! Im 27 now so i still have much to learn from him, but its amazing a psychologist could pinpoint such an effective strategy for entrepreneurs which took me years in business and IT to discover."

You see the vile govt. says that discrimination isn't tolerated in the workplace and so they use it as an excuse to take money to guard against this and instead use it as a means to oppress men and uphold lying women, homosexuals and drug addled deviants. 
All the while Yeshua has said ""what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?""
My way is better because its not MY way but his way and he hasn't failed to take care of me yet and he wont either.
I will close with this ""unless ye be converted and become as little children ye can in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven"".

UgwFLVF9-zWRp6SFd4B4AaABAg,Aaron Wolfenbarger,1522802002964,"SO you believe that people should go along with becoming a member of the system that is about to come to an end?
You see when I was younger I looked ahead and saw a world that was ending. I read the Bible and because I DIDNT go to church I comprehended it. Nobody told me this means this and that means that so I didn't get lied to about it until AFTER I knew what the truth was. SO knowing the word I came to realize that getting insurance for my life, car, house, and getting a career for which I had to go to college for was a fools errand. So Ya I have met people like you who think their lives are so good and that people that spend their time learning of God and coming out of your system of ""BE SOMEBODY"" which is akin to be a slave. You would call me a 47 year old child but I know more than you. I see right through you and your so called methods of getting into peoples heads and its sad really. How adult is it to go along with a system that creates programs ""designed"" to prevent abuses of which they then use to perpetrate the same abuses using your tax dollars? I call that vanity and theft of funds.
When I look at you I see an empty suit, a guy that has been taught useless meaningless things that tend toward destruction rather than life, the suit is to make you seem worthy of listening to but Jesus says such people tend to be liars and thieves.
There is NO dignity in what you do other than your being humbled by it or soon will be.  I shall be exalted in my trust of the most high. ALL your work and ALL your wasted time and effort for nothing! For things that pass away and get consumed by the fire, that's got to sting! Imagine that! a 47 year old child as you say that can do so  MANY things and is really good at following Yeshua. Our forefathers I think it was Benjamin Franklin said "" Jack of all trades master of one' and then suits like you came along and twisted his words to master of NONE so that the deception could take place and people could fit into the slots the wicked assigned for them. I would rather die, chances are I shall be killed but what? Threaten me with eternity? Go ahead!
The REALLY sad thing is I clicked on this and NOTHING your saying came as a surprise to me. I already know where your going and there are no insights to be gleaned from you except self deception, so lets sit back and unpause this and watch it unfold I have some free time to waste."

I'm currently doing a engineering management thesis//dissertation at college and am very interested in psychology so i thought what better than to blend the two subjects. My project is to determine how to increase productivity, quality, innovation etc by rethinking the hiring/selection process. My hypothesis is that there are minute bits of waste occurring in every job 24/7 and this waste can be reduced by more carefully hiring people whos personality and temperament suits a specific job rather than granting whoever ticks all the boxes, and comes accross well in an interview the job. 
Common sense tells me that an introverted person, who has sensing, judging preferences in the mbti test would certainly be more suited to a solitary job such as quality inspector etc, where an extroverted, intuitive, judging individual will by his very nature not be able to operate at such an efficiency that the ISTJ employee will in such a role. (all else the same ofcourse)
likewise, the sensing, judging type will not be suited to a creative, design type role where innovation occurs.
I'd really appreciate if anybody can help me out wit some ideas where to take my project :)

Sounds mostly accurate. I'm not sure about agreeableness though, I don't want to be agreeable but I generally am exceptionally so because I understand that you get out of life what good you put into it. I'm a nice person unless someone makes an unreasonable demand of me, then I'm gonna start a fucking fire.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with my life because everything about the world we live in feels like it was built for someone else but I make due I guess. I'm an I.T guy and I satisfy my creative side by writing orchestral music and making mods for video games. Can't hope for much better I suppose.

We live in a world that favors two kinds of people: those who do what they're told, pour themselves fully into inane things, and who don't ask questions, and those few that defy the odds and succeed at entrepreneurial or risk-taking endeavors because statistically someone has to."

I believe that me as a  mother being  at  home especially through those adolescent year's was important. I have many examples & experiences that made me see that I made the right decision. Getting to the question, so you are basically saying that now I'm in my 40's that basically I'm doomed because I am too old now to find a suitable career for myself. Is that what you mean? I believe that's we are always trying to grow & become good people no matter our age. We are always learning & starting new adventures.

I think it is wrong to say that science sometimes moves with giant leaps. I believe there are times when a lot of discoveries have been made ""under the radar"" or in the context of another problem so they click in with that final step and it looks like a leap or a fast development of ideas, especially in physics. There are a lot of examples were some structure or relation has been discovered and the mathematics necessary for describing it has been finished dozens of years before. To say one: the work on Bose–Einstein condensate, when people started trying to create it, it became apparent that the equation describing its behavior is analogous to the one describing solitons, so some people from the optical communication field quickly became BEC specialists. In my opinion Einstein is a bad example here. His work on relativity is overhyped and over popularized. While it is still a great feat, it by no means comes out of the blue or was done by himself, as is usually portrayed."

I'd like to see a mechanism that takes your test score compares then to a database of jobs and chooses the best based on your score. I'd also like to see my score used in finding a partner. A partner? If I'm more Aggressive then naturally I want a Passive woman. 
And when I got my results there was no mention of politics in the summary. Since I scored very low on a category related to respect authority guess that's the Anarchist in me. 
What could be done to improve the test? 
Compare results with jobs. 
Compare results with compatible partners . Ie if I'm aggressive then a passive person is a match 
Compare employer risk. See if my results will tell an employer I'm risky to hire. 
I'd like to see a recommendation in what to fix on my test.
Of course with that feature you would have to increase cost. I'd gladly pay $50 with all the features I mention.

My results are: Agreeableness: 3 Compassion : 10 Politeness: 2 Consciousness: 80 Industriousness: 91 Orderliness: 54 Extraversion: 43 Enthusiasm: 10 Assertiveness: 81 Neuroticism: 6 Withdrawal: 12 Volatility: 4 Intellect: 89 Openness: 13 Openness to Experience: 53

For example if you want to be creative, being a little happy or manic can be very helpful. It makes the mind flexible. (For me this is a laser lab, where you try to diagnose why a laser is not working properly.)

Whereas during a task that requires focussed attention but very little creativity (think of working through a difficult but well known algebra problem where one step logically follows the next), one can benefit from being somewhat angry (the frown of anger and focus are curiously similar)."

What gets in the way and becomes a barrier is our community's limited conversation and irrational belief system which would be threatened by our consciousness. For this reason we must be rendered unconscious so that we will conform. 
The appeal of Jordan is that his conversation, as brilliant as it is, is belief based, and being that it is belief based, it doesn't threaten the source of the problem, which is our beliefs. In other words. we like him because he makes us feel that we can work it out without disturbing the limitations and distortions of our traditional beliefs.

UghzAPvDjAsD83gCoAEC,Rob Longo,1504485244436,"Agreeableness

Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.

Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.

Extroversion: ""My identity is as others determine it.""

Introvert: Pursues truth through self. Finds comfort in that.
Extrovert: Pursues truth through others. Finds comfort in that.

Introvert: Others challenge self. Socializing threatens self-perception. Become psychologically defensive. Ergo socializing is mentally exhausting. Sequestration in mentally fulfilling.
Extrovert: Others validate self. Socializing aids in self-perception. Become psychologically open. Ergo socializing is mentally invigorating. Sequestration is mentally void.

Think of both the introvert's and extrovert's behaviors as their desire to 'read the book of their own lives'. The introvert can only read it alone. Others keep the book from him. The extrovert can only read it with others. Alone he cannot read the book.

Then factor in higher IQs trending with introverts (identity through self-pursuit i.e. factual substantiation) and lower IQs trending with extroversion (identity through pursuit of others i.e. social substantiation) and it makes sense. 'Self through facts' is more intelligent and can be done alone. 'Self through others' is less intelligent (tribalistic) and must be done through others.

Considering that a high IQ correlates to certain advantages in life, would high scores in these two traits correlate to high IQ scores?"

Uggqt-t0vhckj3gCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485253782,"Political correctness is exquisite in its skill of convalescence.  It's beauty lies in its unabashed generosity.  It lends dignity to the empty coffers of provincial.  The rustic souls bat away the scepter from touching their shoulders.  They refuse to be doused with fair words and yet are in most need of them. This tireless spirit lends warmth to the brute understanding all fangs guard children.  To the whipped back, it causes us to remember how innocence hitched to curiosity can take criminal detours.  It is a forward looking language that sees what can be, but also what actually is before us.  Our self-loathing is unmasked when we hiss at political correctness.  It has the power to reverse hard damage in two generations.  We all have entered spaces turned fun houses distortions.  For this transgression political correctness has had to bare her scarlet letter.  Her captives show disdain for her.  The same ingrates she set free, turn their back on her only to wield red hot banding irons to relabel her disgrace with their former captors.  

I fully understand that some fellows are smarter than others. Life is chillingly unequal.  I get it.  However I have a deep mistrust of IQ tests.  I question how well we understand the mind and it's power to understand and advance solutions. 

The meaning behind the name ""SAT"" is complicated. According to the Kaplan website: ""Originally, SAT stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test. When the SAT test changed a few years ago, the official name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. In 1997, the test makers announced that SAT no longer stands for anything, officially.""

They lost confidence in their own ability to predict intelligence. They lost a court case because they could not back their test up on a scientific basis. So the S.A.T. is not longer an acronym. The same way you spell sat, as in ""I sat down,"" is what their test is now. They lost right to call it an aptitude test.  Then funny thing is that people still spell it out as if it were still an acronym.  Spelling out the SAT test is like spelling S E X in front of children.  It is just a singular word."

As I've been listening to Dr. Peterson over the last few months, as much as I agree that the Left's viewpoint on this is both incorrect and ineffective to help just about anyone (poor people, nonwhite people, trans people especially), I wonder what disadvantaged people are supposed to do, what I'm supposed to do as one, what I'm supposed to to do help others. The Left observes the problem, conceptualizes it incorrectly, and its interventions make it worse. The Right refuses to acknowledge the problem at all. As Peterson has said when discussing Orwell, ""the Left doesn't care about the poor, they just hate the rich."" And the Right doesn't care about the poor either. I can almost here Righties say -- ""don't you know free markets are pulling people out of poverty all the time all over the globe?"" Yes, which is why I'm not an anti-capitalist. It doesn't change my observation that very high IQ nonwhite people from poor backgrounds are more likely to end up lower middle class saddled with debt, struggle with chronic mental and physical health problems,, or even end up in prison."

This observation would allow a curious person to observe that political correctness can become a vehicle for authoritarianism. An ethos which purports to protect creativity and openness but in practice has the opposite effect; such an ethos has to be explained in the context in which it actually exists - an not by the rather elastic standards of its proponents.

Or perhaps intelligence can transcend personality based pre-dispositions in political views. I value order, hierarchy, traditional family values etc. But all because I've developed those views from learning about history, economics, biology etc.  But that doesn't explain why there are people on the far right and far left who are very high IQ but there personality bias seems to overpower their reason, and their reason simply rationalizes their bias."

And we know from behavioral genetics that conscientiousness has a heritability of ~0.5, which naturally leads one to presume that some genes are involved. So if we assume that's indeed the case, and since there isn't much differences in overall conscientiousness by gender, might it be the case that some of the same genes are partially responsible for both industriousness and orderliness, but are just expressed differently depending on the gender (possibly as a result of different sex hormonal profiles)?

I took your classes back in 2008 and a lot of this material on disgust is new to me.
I think you said that the name of the hypothesis was 'parasite stress authoritarianism' but i didn't catch the name of the theorist.

I look forward to learning this new theory on the relationship between disgust and orderliness, but right now I am interpreting your lecture through the old lens of Freud's psychosexual developmental model that grounds conscientiousness in toilet training. I'm not really sure how this new theory is different except that it seems to explain industriousness and guilt and shame as being motivated by keeping disease out of a wider social context, instead of reducing these things to early childhood socialization.

If you could provide some clarification on this new theory that would be appreciated.

What if the ideal is the person's dominant hierarchy, which is why there isn't a care about the specifics of the social hierarchy or other hierarchies because their personal one is abstract, internal, and can be superimposed upon another.  An industrious person already knows why they work (their ideal) and this ideal can be superimposed upon any given structure.  So if a person believes that they are to provide for their family and this person tends to believe that money is valuable, then being an accountant is a good job to have.  Then they will be an accountant because that provides them the money to live out their ideal, which is to provide for their family.  If this person loses their job, they will do whatever it takes to find another without any care for what it is because whatever it is will be injected with or superimposed by their ideal.

UggJ3ERY7c_4ZHgCoAEC,Hrj dc,1472948571049,"@7:00 to 7:50 High social status means high survival value but does high survival value mean high social status??

When one thinks in terms of Darwin, one concludes that high social status means high survival value and vice versa and that's perfectly reasonable. The tribal leader is tribal leader because he knows how to attack the tiger that constantly attacks the tribe or at least the tribal members perceive and think of him as the one who can, he has high survival value or they think and believe he has high survival value so he gets high status. Imagine, a tribe of say some 50 people, the one who can independently survive longest obviously has the highest survival value. When people align themselves with this individual, who has the skill and potential to survive for the longest on his own despite the impeding danger of wild beasts, harsh weather and hunger, they too increase their chances of survival thus a social hierarchy emerges and 'the one' becomes the tribal leader. (There is an another way by which one can achieve high social status in that given tribe, that is by being a tyrant, by being the tiger himself. Morality aside even through economic cost benefit analysis for long term survival,  one could easily conclude that former is a much better way to be than latter. (assuming he has no psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies))

This kind of reasoning for higher social status through the individual's survival potential seems to fall apart when applied to the modern society. An average night club comedian has more social value and status than say an average engineer who knows to build an efficient and cost effective dam or car. A Saturday night talk show host has high social status than an army veteran. A video on Solar cell fabrication on YouTube gets comparatively less views than a music video or even worst, a video on stupid pranks. What people value and what people should value under Darwinian living seems to be worlds apart. 

Water is a vital substance for survival but its cheap, diamond is costly. Man kind survived for years without diamond and they still can but without water they cannot. water is important. But just being important doesn't makes its valuable. One could say that supply and demand determines the price and value and end this here. But why should diamonds be more valuable? If diamonds had no Jewelry-kind application and value but only industrial-kind application and value. I guess, it would be just as worth and valuable as lead, maybe a little more and but that's it. Scarcity alone doesn't makes something valuable.

Supply and demand??  We have no shortage of Jokes, if I could collect all the jokes and comedies mankind has ever produced and start reading them and laughing now, I could easily laugh all the way to my death, we have enough joke and comedy repository. Now, that doesn't makes new jokes or comedies worthless, does it?

Entertainment is bigger than Engineering. Maybe that because Meta-game is larger than the game itself. So, it makes sense that diamond, with its alchemical significance, has more value than water, that politician are more important than engineers, that hollywood makes more than the health care industry.

Obviously nurture weighs on our personalities. For example, I am extremely high in openness with an IQ in the 85th percentile, but I also am extremely high in orderliness (97). I grew up in serious dysfunction which involved neglect, abuse and having a mother with BPD. These variables have arranged my personality in a contradictory manner. I'm also very low in agreeableness, which is not common for women.  Due to being exposed to what I was as a child molded or, one might say distorted how I see the world. For example, I am acutely aware of people and their intentions (hence the disagreeableness) and I'm quite sensitive to cleanliness (the orderliness) but I'm super creative and my mind is ""on"" all of the time. My point is because I'm naturally creative/open it would be assumed I would not be orderly but I am. The high levels of disgust as well as being disagreeable come more from being in uncomfortable situations as a child than from my nature. 
Understanding myself and many (not all mind you) of the ""whys"" as well as knowing some industrious  people I would dive more into background and childhood for reasons of high vs low industriousness...it's a thought."
UgzmtL8ZpNhWmkUh1mN4AaABAg,Toni Duval,1528071771351,"I really don’t know what I’m talking about, but I really enjoyed wrestling with these ideas! :D

Prof. Peterson said at 56 minutes; “You can have a pretty vicious personality disorder that’s characterized by extremely disorganized behaviour and a complete inability to put long term plans into operation and still have a high IQ. One of the things we really can’t figure out is [why] the relationship between IQ and Industriousness is zero. Most of the brain models are predicated on the idea that your ability to engage in long term planning is a factor that’s associated with intelligence. Industrious people seem to not only engage in long term planning but they seem to do it right; if they are more industrious they put their plans into operation then the plans actually work. But it’s not correlated with IQ.” 

I think IQ tests designate the range of how complex or simplistic your (long/short term) plans are, but IQ tests do not factor in necessary value systems that determine whether or not a complex/simplistic plan will be feasible. In other words, no matter how well thought out a plan is, it doesn’t guarantee the plan will work. I think people with high IQs are aware that failure is definitely a possibility (especially with more complex plans such as the long term variety) and when failure is thought to be more likely than success, it leads to the pre-mature abandonment of their plan. 

Industrious people seem more fixated on the “implementation of plans” rather than controlling the outcome of said plans. The goal is to 'work hard at implementing the plan', and a high or low IQ does not stop an industrious person from working hard. I think you may have more success in measuring industriousness if you had your test subject carry out a plan rather than process one (for example, offer your test subjects a blank page with the instructions of hiding 14 ""N"" letters among a string of ""M"" letters, and whoever had the longest string of letters is likely to be more industrious than the rest). If being Industrious means that you are more willing to work hard, then it follows that your tenacity allows any of your small accomplishments to become bigger ones (as per the Matthew Principle). Therefore, Industrious people are more likely to be successful in the long term, regardless of their IQ. 

That’s what I came up with, but like I said, I know nothing :D"
UgxkkRPjF4P1pfUeAUp4AaABAg,Patrick Alaggio,1525393371363,"~55 minutes into this discussion there seems to be a significant gap in our wisdom as to why high IQ and a lack of sensitivity to disorderliness (disgust sensitivity) exists. The question that seems too difficult to figure out is ""why is the relationship between IQ and industriousness zero?!""  Could it be as simple as motivational influences upon a developing child? If a bright child ascertains that he can get everything he wants from his parents with proper behavioral responses then why struggle being industrious? Why bother when being polite and obedient takes up much less time and energy, which is then freed to pursue whatever activities are more pleasing and rewarding. Furthermore, if a person is exceptionally bright and those around him seem dull then why bother to compete? It's like a world class athlete being put up against a group of children. Where's the motivation in that? Disorderliness seems simple enough to explain; why bother arranging things that will take me away from far more important thoughts and endeavors when they will just become messy over and over again FOREVER! I've got more important things to do. Finally, why compete to satisfy a social norm if I care not about climbing over people on this rat maze imposed life of ours. After all, I have all that is needed and all the time in the world to enjoy my OWN creativity and I care not a wit about what others think about me. I respect myself, my passions and that is enough... I have no one to please except myself. Isn't this answer enough Professor Peterson? Either I am misunderstanding your dilemma or you are simply testing the class... or cannot see the forest through the trees with all of the limbic vs. frontal cortex considerations.

UgxOSrbkL6NWkkqM80B4AaABAg,garet claborn,1515025371472,"I have a theory on industriousness v intellect. Based mostly on my relationship with my younger sister. As a kid she tended to think I was more intelligent and I'd argue with her that she's got a different type of intelligence pretty often. - she is highly industrious whereas I'm rather difficult to motivate lol. If you can get me going I practically never quit but that's quite a tall order. ANYWAY

The more trivial the task was, I'd notice that I'd be bored very easily whereas my sister would see something she has a grasp of as opportunity to shine. She likes a challenge every bit as much as I do make no mistake but she liked to prove herself through effort. I see a feedback loop of challenge-->success stimulation-->continue, as the driving force behind all the smaller tasks that make up a 'macrotask'. 

It could be that for intelligent people they haven't had the exposure to things that are simultaneously familiar and challenging, requiring constant effort and a slow drip for success dopamine. If so, pathways would be less keen on noticing 'hey this is an opportunity to feel good about yourself!' but for some intelligent people it would vary greatly"
Ugzd9_nsplj9vPDc-p54AaABAg,J J,1509754971484,"The IQ discussion suffers from foggy definitions. There is mental hardware (memory buffer size, etc.), mental software (mental habits, thinking strategies, developed skills, avoidance of biases, epistemic hygiene, etc.), and actual software output (stuff you've learned). 

IQ is actually circularly defined as the ""smart""ness which makes you successful in life, which is why it is so well correlated with life success! What Peterson seems to be trying to measure (half the time, he shifts around on this) is really hardware. He correctly points out that better hardware makes better software and a bigger pile of facts (though it's simplistic to see knowledge as a bunch of facts; epistemic hygiene of factual info is far more important for many disciplines, especially the ""high IQ"" ones like physics theorist). 

They are using incidentals to basically look at hardware capacity. Your mental hardware specs. The huge missing piece is how interested you have been in created good mental software, good mental habits. How diligent you have been at that. Hardware does place a ceiling on that, *but not a floor*. It does correlate, but is by no means the same thing. Not even close. 

For example, avoiding logical fallacies is huge! And there is no guarantee that someone with excellent mental hardware will avoid many of the logical fallacies. Sure, some of them, like circular reasoning, are easier to see if your memory is better: you realize when you've just argued yourself in a circle because you recall where you started. But many are not of that nature. And many people just aren't that self-aware. They don't care about going meta on their thought process. 

The kind of fogginess here hits much harder on analysis of very smart people than very unsmart people, so it doesn't as much apply to the envelope-stuffing guy, but it's a real shame to have someone who is very smart, has excellent mental hygiene habits, etc. score only moderately well on an IQ test (like because they don't know the capital of Georgia - WTF? - or have a bad association with arithmetic for an unrelated reason so get nervous when calculating under pressure) and then conclude they aren't cut out for greatness in the intellectual realm.

Measure hardware and call it hardware capacity. Measure overall useful life ability and call that overall life ability (even divide it into fluid and crystalized; i.e., software and output), but don't conflate the two."
Ugx01JFprCT8-g-9y-V4AaABAg,Chuck T.,1509754971495,"Prof Peterson, you are working with several logical fallacies about industrious people. For example, you say it seems they can regulate their own behaviour to not procrastinate. Well this is near totally false. It's not a cognitive ability at all. Not only can they not regulate their behaviour, but this inbred trait borders on a disorder itself, but one that often tends to be an overall benefit  to the afflicted. They can't sit still or not be industrious. The skill and self control they lack is to slow down, analyze and collect enough info to act in a more informed manner. Normally someone smart enough will recognize the awesome asset of the industrious person and direct their massive efforts in a productive fashion, often in a mutually beneficial way."

In math tutoring we like to ensure people that are having difficulties that it's best not to think of talent as a factor in their success. Especially with math's stigma in american culture, it's easy for people to get discouraged. Nevertheless, it seems to me that talented - that is to say intelligent - people don't have to work as hard to do well in school. One then either decides to set harder goals, which would have to be external to school since you can't get better than an A, or one could become habitually lazy. So intelligence and industriousness can both result in success independently of each other, but I would expect that intelligent people that are not industrious all have some similar pathology so that they choose laziness."

UghKYWd1dEgEYHgCoAEC,Gwen Stoll,1504484576333,"Hello Dr. Peterson. To the problem of industriousness.  Taking a guess, I would hypothesize dependency on a couple of factors: a) the ease to translate intention into motor function. If you have to think about something a couple of times before the action it carries out, then it consumes a lot more willpower. b) the relative absence of mixed emotions. Singular emotions translate into small decisions that have to be made on the path more easily, whereas mixed emotions need to be processed on a higher cognitive level, which consumes more resources. c) high attention, particularly to detail. d) good resilience from single, failing steps. Both a) and b) make a person more prone to distractions.   Then industriousness and intelligence could contextually correlate dependent on how simplified one's internal model for the current situation is. If one has a very simplified model, the translation into action should be easier, and if the model is still complicated or yields ambiguous solutions, acting out plans should be easier.

Then, intelligence may counteract industriousness when the situational awareness is high (for example as measured by Richard Davidson), i.e. the sequence of encountered situations contains many new observations that intelligence wants to integrate into the model. Following a plan should be easier when those additional stimuli remain subceptions. But once the model is complete, the inhibiting effect should be less. 

Another influential factor may be self-awareness, i.e. insula activity. If self-awarenness remains high during tasks that are related to industriousness, emotional contextualization should be reduced and thus alter inhibition or drive."

One question I have about IQ and the problem you are facing in regards to being able to be industrious might more than likely have something to do with upbringing. I know some very intelligent people that were in foster care and in group homes but that kind of environment isn't conducive to an emotional state of well being that produces industrious people. In that, I mean that if you are exceptionally intelligent in a group home or foster home, ""who cares"". So, then the outlook of the person with said high IQ, doesn't care either. That to me is an extreme example but it happens a lot. I'm sure the ignorance of a child's talents and potential happens in a lot of homes with parents who are also intelligent that work long hours or with parents that are gone for long periods of time as well. 

I know of a guy who can understand physics easily and is currently writing a book on his version of unified theory but he lives on a ranch and isn't very successful but he isn't poor and he also never graduated from college and anyone that knows him, doesn't really like him because he is socially obtuse and hard to get along with. I think the problem with having a high IQ and being industrious is about the hundreds or possibly thousands (or maybe even more) of people with high IQ's that aren't recognized as such because the people they are around don't care to find out so the person that has that potential doesn't care either. I could be way off, I don't know. I'm just speaking from personal experience. At the age of 17 I was tested to have an IQ of 136 and no one cared, so I joined the military and made it a career.

Ughc_7ePvZRY7XgCoAEC,DarthYuYevon,1504484578307,"Lastly, about the guy who seemed to not have the ability to do any job, Peterson left out a bunch of useful info, like for instance, could the guy drive a car? Could he put together a desk or some other furniture by himself? Could he write a clear email? Could he read information and understand it, like an magazine article, newspaper, or book? I ask because if he was really that dumb then you would be able to see the result of his stupidity in other areas of his life. You won't be able to drive a car if you can't even work the lowest of jobs. You won't be able to put together objects like furniture that you need to assemble. In fact what could this guy do at all? Without knowing this, it's hard to know what his IQ may have been. Could he even speak well enough for you to understand? He sounded like he was retarded, and clearly retarded people won't find jobs. Peterson mentioned we have a large unemployment problem. Do we really have a very high percent of retarded people in the U.S? That seems unlikely, and what would be the solution? It seems schools should be able to figure out IQ of children in grade school which should determine who is retarded and who isn't, and then come up with jobs that are only for retarded people, where they are watched and cared for by staff, and pay the staff well for their job of watching over them.
.
Lastly, for the dumb, it wouldn't be a problem to point out who is dumb and who isn't if society wasn't so hostile towards the intellectually inferior. It's always people saying out of anger, ""what are you dumb or something?!"" It seems kind of dumb to get mad at the dumb. Why not embrace the reality that some people are born dumb at no fault of anyone since you can't help how you're born, and parents can't help who the give birth to? If you collect all of the dumb before that become adults and monitor them in a place where they do the most simple jobs, and even a separate facility for those who are hostile, like a kind of jail for the dumb, you take care of the big issue of heavy violence in America by getting at those who are most likely to be violent enough to kill someone, before they do it.

Anyways, just my thoughts."
UgjSV9WM_gaquXgCoAEC,DarthYuYevon,1504484578320,"Sounds to me that IQ tests only test what you write on paper as your answers to questions, but it doesn't reveal what the level of the intelligence of your actual brain in your skull is. I say this because studies have shown that if you compare students IQ of same race, and class, but from a great school to crappy school, the students from the crappy school show to have lower IQ's than the students from the great school. The difference is environment of the schools, not the brains of the students. If the students from the crappy schools went to the great school with their much better teachers and updated materials and usually a lot more funding from rich folks in the area, they will do much better and therefore result and testing with a higher IQ. So to say you can determine the intelligence level of ones brain with school IQ test scores is irrational and unscientific. The best you can have is an idea of what the IQ level may possibly be and then ask what type of environment the kid has been in for his life to see what could have contributed to that, but it in no way proves for a fact that this or that child has a brain of great intelligence or not. I like Peterson, but people like him never seem to factor in how culture plays a huge role in why one may or may not score high in IQ.
.
 Testing the difference between a retarded person and a normal person is pretty easy, and you can physically see the differences in real life behavior. But a lot of people claim that you can also see a differences between borderline retarded and normal. You can have one person score a low IQ of 70 and appear to have a low functioning brain, yet in real life this person makes smart choices, and succeeds in very brainy careers, while the person who scores a normal IQ of 115 may have good career but is actually useless to the company because they get by only on appearing valid but doesn't do anything and then gets out performed by the supposed low IQ person. To me, there needs to be a way to match IQ numbers with real life action all the way up and down the list from below 70 to above normal IQ, and I have never seen this. I only hear assumptions that claim to be facts because of supposed accurate numbers. I number statistic can mean what ever you want it to mean, but what does it really mean.
.
If you can't accurately match the IQ numbers with the actions of the person in real life, it's a flawed way of knowing what someone's actual intelligence is. It's like the idea of if you have a country accent and you're poor, and a lot of people like this are poor, it must be because they have a low IQ and look at the low IQ test scores so it must be true, so they must be stupid. But there are several reasons outside of IQ possibilities that could have contributed to why they're poor, and why they score low with IQ.. Anyways, those are my thoughts. I'll add, if you score with low IQ's, look to see if that actually matches what you do in life. If you are a success in life in brainy careers, ask, how would a low IQ allow me to do this. If you score with a high IQ, think twice about your situation if the life your living doesn't match your IQ numbers. Are you really doing a good job in your career or is it because you were friends with the right people? Are you truly skilled or do you just get by with bullsh*t? Is that irritation you have the fact that you can see that a person you feel are low thinking, are actually out performing you and causing you depression? Maybe you need to rethink your IQ."

Conscientiousness seems like more of a repressive superego than anything that could be called 'intelligent' in the sense of exploring and incorporating novelty (learning).

Anyways so glad these lectures are getting posted
they're endlessly entertaining and enlightening"
UghkA02eHzg9FXgCoAEC,Edward Harvey,1504484580395,The correlation between reaction speed and IQ is really interesting. Have you ever noticed that the best comedians are also really bright. In the UK many of our best comedy acts graduated from Oxbridge.
Uggt6Ej9-FVT0XgCoAEC,Ruan Putka,1504484580403,"Jordan B Peterson But openness and intellect are strongly correlated, right? I can see how they are different and personally i can see people leaning very heavily in one of these to facets, so why they are correlated in the general population? It doesn't make sense."
UghOxxIo84XeVngCoAEC,Taime,1472948580418,"Prof. Peterson, thank you for posting these series. I took this course and Maps of Meaning with you in 2007-2008, and they changed my life since back then. I get such a different perspective and a much more in depth understanding of your lectures now that I have more life experience.

ps. I think it's funny that you're saying ""you know"" a lot now, and I don't remember you saying the filler phrase back then. Then I remembered that your daughter must be a teenager now and you must have picked it up from her."

  ""We cant figure out why intelligent people don't want to be a good little economic unit for us and chase the carrot on the stick. Why can't we get them on the work/consumerism hamster wheel as much? How can we get them to play the GDP game with a ferocious seriousness?""

Something about games and candles and worth....How about some sort of 'buys into the dream' metric?"
UgjIW6tk53Xc3HgCoAEC,Abreviatur,1472948580442,"Does ""higher intelligence"" describe actually some added quality (like faster working of the biological structures), a more efficient structure (like use of better algorithms), a better ability to focus and shut out other mental noise, or the ability to manipulate ""abstract"" data as images? The last item was my impression after asking a number of gifted mathematicians and programmers about their mental experience when working on a problem. It seems that at least a fair number of highly intelligent people have a very stable imagination for abstracta which they can manipulate like ordinary folks play Tetris or some such. This also explains why some people love ""abstract"" problems. For them, there is nothing abstract at all!"
Ughb8zWOjOp9V3gCoAEC,rh001YT,1472948580453,"Dr. Peterson always gives thorough presentations of the subject matter.  But when it comes to psychology I am not very convinced about it's accurateness or usefulness.  I like to think of stuff that seems to defy or minimize it's accuracy and usefulness.  I'll give just two examples to be brief:
1) Regardless of one's intelligence, assuming one is not an imbecile, the outcome of one's life will vary greatly according to how much wisdom one has accessed or been fed.  
2) Exceptions are very interesting, and don't always disprove the rule, since the rules are for the masses.  So we might want to consider that a different set of pyschological axioms/theories are needed for the exceptions...but how would those be pieced together.  I like the example of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was born and raised dirt poor in a shack in Pakistan without piped water or electricity, lost his father at an early age, and attended K-10 in a shack of a schoolhouse.  How did he get from there, to university, to working for banks in England, amassing a fortune of a hundred million, then appointed finance minister of India, then served two terms as Prime Minister and flipped the economy from communism/socialism to capitalism/socialism, creating an unprecendented sudden increase in prosperity like nothing ever seen before.  And he's not a playboy, not an extrovert, not super energetic, aactually very soft-spoken, and he's a religious person, a Seikh.  He's not even a politician in the sense that he never sought political office.   He probably was intelligent but his other traits don't support his truly massive success."
UghREK_wkD_ijHgCoAEC,Bagels Truth,1472948580457,"When you talk about problems with the information coming out of educational psychology, it makes me think about the book called Mindset.  Do you know of Carol Dweck's work and if you do what do you think of it?"
UgjBRdsV36ypJ3gCoAEC,thedjudjubeast,1472948580470,"This angle is awkward, especially when compared to the 2015 lecture series."
Uggb9bwPqPCxOXgCoAEC,Geli,1472948580492,"Jordan, have you read Gogol's The Overcoat? The premise is a man who is extremely hard working but not at all bright, such that he is adept in his current situation, but any promotion or novelty at all are impossible for him to handle. Dostoevsky sited it as an important influence. It's quite short, and you may even find it funny in its own dark, Russian way."
UghtE_AGQy4urHgCoAEC,Geli,1472948580505,"Sure intellect exists. We have talked about it for thousands of years. But it's rarely been seen as monistic. It might have a male and a female aspect which are quite separate and even opposed. It might carry potential in leadership and value in every common situation, but also carry the potential for a whole set of vices of its own, which are antithetical to success. 

But Intelligence probably has little to do with knowledge of trivia or innate curiosity, which today's IQ tests seem suited to measure. I should know. Curiosity for menial trivia I have in spades, but actual intelligence I'm still not so sure about. Or as the prof said, modern psychology might be better at rooting out those who are given to think they're intelligent, than the droves of those whose intelligence has gone unrecognized and underdeveloped. Again I would know, I think pretty highly of myself."

In the last two decades I have observed an explosion of True Believers appear around the world. People who are determined to ""make a difference"", and the first thing they resort to is the adoption of an ideology. A cause. Something to attach their lives to because if they didn't they would feel their lives are superfluous and therefore meaningless. The keystone to the antidote is the active involvement of fathers in the lives of their children from birth. Marxists know this intuitively if not explicitly, and that is why they have taken steps to force the father's influence out of the family.

Eric Hoffer wrote at length on this human tendency in his works, particularly The True Believer, The Ordeal of Change, and The Passionate State of Mind. He explains why people join a mass movement, and the human deficiency that promotes it. Easy reads, exceptionally lucid, and still available for a sawbuck or two. Sometimes the local library system has them.

Hannah Arendt covers similar ground in her treatise of Totalitarianism. A substantial portion of her writings mirror Eric's, from a socio-political perspective. She also covers to a limited extent the revolutionary mind, which Billington details in his Fire in the Minds of Men. I found her writings also available in the library system. Both these authors originated in Germany during WWII. Both were trying to alert the world how German society went wrong, and how the trends were spreading."

The Other Element
The structure was set and the rules were laid down
scaffolds set in history
a doctrine of nobility to adopt the suffering of the world
In some small part
In some untold whisper that echoes only in the mind of a
humble man?
The humble men now fell humbly to the structures
the structures now built themselves around those men on their knees
the men crumbled and melted
morphed and melded, until they became no more than this:
a shadow mass with no eyes or ears
Ambient technological overtones let the shadow spill

into - over - under - through

now you have become shadow.
You are the shadow
you are the Shadow
You Are The Shadow.

Now as a Shadow, what do You do?
You do nothing.
The Shadow is Most High and the Shadow's Will is All
Now the Shadow worships itself
The Shadow clings to the structures and You tear at them wildly!
With your Shadowy Claws and with your Shadowy Fangs
and Faceless Screams that seem to emerge only from Shadow...

Society gone
Shadow remains
the beauty of life no more than 
a stain

You realize too late now when everything's lost
Becoming The Shadow Has The Highest Cost"

I am of the opinion that many of the worldly changes are ushered in or begun with red-hair or ginger figures/individuals. 

Lenin himself was a red-hair... so is Trump... George Washington... Thomas Jefferson... Queen Elizabeth II... Queen Isabella (she helped Columbus who himself was a red-hair)... Genghis Khan... Ramses II... etc. 

I'm not advocating any conspiracy, I'm just being objective with what historically happened... I just think it seems odd that red-hairs seem to be at the fore-front in so many world changing episodes."

JP's criticism around the complexity of maintaining idealistic institutional superstructures is actually very insightful and well put.  However, his comments on the ""Pareto distribution"" and the basic idea that class stratification is justified on this basis are totally insane.  No person outperforms others to a degree that would ethically justify the wealth inequality produced under our current economic paradigm, and to suggest that this is a direct consequence of taking responsibility for oneself is a truly cruel lie, exactly of the same sort used to justify the existence of unquestioned authority such as the very USSR he points to here.

The lesson we must take from the cruelty of the USSR is not to superficially hate leftism, but rather the opposite: we must understand that pragmatic reality and human empathy must supercede any underlying ideology, including one that blames mere individual irresponsibility for our ails."

Pol Pot did not kill 6 million Cambodians, he killed nearly 1 million by violent means, more than another million by over work and starvation.

Obviously, H-man is a smart and funny guy.  What a nice guy!
The way that she instantly assumed that ""humongous"" was referring to his penis, even though he made no such reference, and the way she kept demanding that he make such a reference, which can be inferred from her later and much repeated claim of sexual harrrassment, indicates that she was looking for a sex-based fight, and was so disappointed that she didn't get it, that she redirected her aggression against security personnel, who were professional and restrained in the face of her indecency towards them.
Yes, it is really horrible when the Soviets, or their stand-ins, bury you, without the decency of killing you first, but that's how Marxists roll.  When they can't afford a bullet for your head, they skip the bullet, and just bury you.  They're indecent like, but indecency is the essence of Marxism.
The Nazi death camps continued beyond the end of the Second World War.  Those horrors were extended by the Soviet Union under Communism, or Marxism.
I love Jordan Peterson's literary references.  I'm inclined to that myself, having majored in English and French.  He validates me, and I approve of that.  As should we all.

Please see Gilad Atzmon to understand the mindset and organised opposition you will soon be facing. At first glance, their stances appear to span the entire spectrum of a topic but they also envelop it and disavow the opinions of others in favour of the tribal.

UgzZs6XdLfn1HV8qCRl4AaABAg,Alice Stanford,1525394002190,"There's lots of very good stuff in this video, and plenty of sincere passion. Yes, we need to know about Solzhenitsyn's work - and I applaud the moral of your story about truth telling and responsibility. But it's a pity that you push a conspiracy theory and allow kids to see you as the hero rescuing Solzhenitsyn from wanton neglect. I was alive when his works were first translated into English and he got mega-publicity then. Why he is no longer taught in universities is a puzzle. It is not that there are no anti-totalitarian, or no right wing intellectuals. I've met some of them.

You attack a straw man when you attack the view that the USSR was ""not real communism"". Where is the argument in this lecture that shows that communism - as a means of social organization - has to be a totalizing system that cannot acknowledge diversity or individuality? (Elsewhere you treat the left's attachment to multiculturalism with throwaway contempt - but it is an indication of an impulse to allow more in rather than force a single pattern on everyone.) Why did totalitarianism appear on the right and the left at the same time? Why were similar impulses at play in Revolutionary France? Couldn't it simply be that violent disjunctive chance unleashes forces of all sorts that tend to simplistic rule based, bureaucratic and punitive control. Arguing that all the previous experiments (Russia, China, Cambodia etc) have all produced the same outcome does not prove that that outcome is the inevitable shape of a communist society, only that a certain pattern emerges when peasant societies try to jump to a post-capitalist system - particularly when all those  are looking towards the USSR/Leninist theory as their model.

I am not a communist, myself. Nor am I a political theorist. But if I find these objections boiling up in my mind in response to your lecture, perhaps many, many other people have the same experience. (Don't think those who take your classes will necessarily ""speak truth to power"" and challenge you. As you know very well there are a lot of pressures on them not to do so.)

As for the poor mother who wrote to her daughter she was guilty - that was no lie. She was guilty of not being able to protect her daughter and provide a real attachment figure/place of safety that would enable that daughter to grow. Was she supposed to write the ""truth"" that she was not guilty of what she was accused of an condemn her daughter (a child) to being treated just as she was treated? I find that part of the lecture really lacking in compassion and insight."

I would recommend you to read about the atrocities that were happening in the Romanian prisons during the communist time, more specific the Pitesti experiment. The people were tortured, humiliated in the worst possible way, starved, made the inmates to beat each other till they couldn't move, if not they were being beaten/punished by the guards, it's just out of this world. The most important detail of this experiment, is that it as performed on mostly deep religious people. It was design to kill every humane trait in a person's life, especially of a religious one. 
""However, what has not yet become universal knowledge is the fact that in the Romanian Gulag Archipelago there was an island of absolute horror, such as existed nowhere else in the entire geography of the communist penitentiary system: Pitesti Prison."" 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn himself described this ""experiment"", as the ""most terrible act of barbarism in the contemporary world"".

I hope you will see my comment, read about it, and bring it as an example in your further lectures. It's has to be know.....
Thank you very much."

Were there extremists in the party cells : yes. Communists Socialists and sympathizers   in Western Europe didn't kill their own citizens by the millions over a political idea... don't include us."

UgzRWSvTBPJle2RJoPl4AaABAg,P N,1515026026491,"Ha ha!  I just read every single comment.  You guys are hilarious and I love you. I can hardly wait to finish this so I can see the end which everyone is raving about. 

While I'm at it I wanted to recommend a series of four published books that are made up of Soviet samizdat (meaning ""for the desk drawer"").  Solzhenitsyn was responsible for the publication of these volumes I believe. He and Maximov. They are called Kontinent I, Kontinent Ii, Kontinent III, Kontinent IV.

First I have to tell you that the one good thing about the terrible political system under the Soviet Union, and I feel guilty for saying and feeling this, is that it did something that pretty much isn't done to us here in the West. And that is that those who rebelled against that system risked absolutely everything including their lives.

I like to say that it turned them either into alcoholics or diamonds. And in the case of Vladimir Vysotsky, both :-)

But if you Google for instance the story ""and even our tears"" I think you can find that online. I made it available. It comes from one of the Kontinent volumes and it is so alive it will blow your mind.  It's also about the camps.

By the way, you will note that another diamond that was created by a totalitarian event (Bill C 16) is Jordan Peterson."

UgyCnTr2-GeOqI0tIrR4AaABAg,P N,1515026026505,There is a documentary that I saw 30 or so years ago called The Killing Fields and it is about the Cambodian genocide under Pol Pot. It's still around. It was shown it across the u.s. in major theaters it was a big sensation.  Of course these Lefty profs never show their students any of this.
UgwaPosgxnwY2scKbf94AaABAg,P N,1515026026516,"The great Soviet poet Osip Mandelstam was married to Nadezhda Mandelstam. Osip died in the camps in the thirties. His wife has written two memoirs. Her name NADEZHDA means HOPE. Her first memoir is called hope against hope and the second is called hope abandoned.  She saved her husband's poetry by memorizing it.

These two volumes of memoirs are super fascinating. One thing I remember:  her husband was puzzled by this new word called progress, what did progress MEAN?  when he was told, and had internally absorbed the insanity of the notion, he broke down sobbing inconsolably.  

And don't think he's a wimp or an idiot. He understood I believe that ideology comes from this belief in some future ideal, that we actually supposedly ""head towards"" something called progress.  Marxism of course is predicated on this.

Utopias are always based on the future, and the notion of a progress toward the future that will be ideal.

And in placing who the Mandelstams are. They were very good friends with Varlam Shalamov whose short stories about the camps are in two English volumes entitled Graphite and Kolyma Tales. Solzhenitsyn had asked him to write the Gulag with him but he was too old and sick from being in the camps himself.

Related also to what JBP tells of in this very powerful YouTube video that you're watching now:  there is a superb story by Jacques Lusseyran called Jeremy.  You need to read it. It is a true story from Lusseyran's time in Buchenwald.  Jeremy has  amazing Insight yet he is a common man.  A matter of fact man. But he made a huge difference in the camps because he had a an inner spiritual presence from facing life and knowing what it is about.  His insight is simple but unbelievably fascinating.

Lusseyran is known as the blind hero of the French Resistance. He survived the camp.

Another truly amazing story of his which is also a true story is called Poetry in Buchenwald."

Ugxo7fgXHfSqVuppvVV4AaABAg,Luke Majewski,1512347632961,"My aunt's mother, now an old woman, was sent to the gulag by the soviets from post war communist Poland because her family were of old nobility. Reason being that their land was now the property of the ""people"" . She survived because as a young girl she was one of the few people in the camp that knew how to read, write and add. She was the book keeper for the camp and for it she got grain and and potato peelings she shared with her mother and sister. She told me that when they were released from the train, they were given a shovel and a small hand axe and left to their own. There were no walls of barb wire to keep them there, and the guards simply stated that if they wanted to escape they could. And why not, in every direction it was a thousand kilometers of tundra , and nothing else. They dug holes in the ground as housing, and in the summer it was the only shelter from swarms of mosquitoes. They were in charge of cattle and she described a moment when one of the cows died, the people with bare hands minced the animal and covered the blood in dirt and snow so there was no trace of it, within minutes. To this day when when she sees the color red on TV, she turns the channel. 

This is not a story from a book, the people that went though this are still out there, many in Poland and Russia. This isn't even the distant past. You can believe  me or not but growing up in Poland at the end of communism I got to hear many first hand experiences from people like her. Even my own grandmother who remembers the soviet ""heroes"" shooting a boy in the head because he wouldn't give them his bike.

The responsibility and risks of a global system if small regional familial governments without institutions like the un outweighs the guarantee of tiranny. In one you have freedom, responsibility and risk and in the other you have a life designed and laid out by the ultimately corrupt to whom you will be nothing but a slave and you'll be discarded like garbage when youre no longer of use for the machine. And it's not coming in the form of a satanic zionist takeover. That's just one side of the divide and conquer strategy. It wil come under the veil of christianity.

I have been told that while the holocaust has evidence, this text has none, and thus they dismiss it out right in an argument against such collectivist positions. Naturally, given the nature of the text, I haven't been able to find supporting evidence myself, and I'm desperate to have a single source to present and say, ""do you see how disgusting you are for dismissing these crimes as lies?"" Still, I don't have that source, and if I did they would naturally dismiss it without care for the same ideological reasons. And so without supporting evidence I have stopped using the text in any argument and I'm forced to point out the lack of evidence of socialism or communism ever functioning as anything more than a disastrous campaign of civil atrocity.

I am currently engaged in reading this book, and it is too much sometimes to take in large doses. I read a chapter, or even sometimes just a few pages, and I must put it down and meditate on what I've just read. Everyone owes it to themselves to read this book, especially given the current political climate of the western world. 
It is very interesting that this woman, upon hearing HM state his [name], automatically - like a computer algorithm - assumed that he was using a euphemism about a particular part of his anatomy, and the part most convenient for her chosen purpose. How does she know he wasn't stating his YT channel name? How does she know he was not adopting this moniker as a way of referring to his pot belly. These ideological slaves have been programmed to search in desperation for anything that can be highlighted as an offence against their identity or adopted identity group, or even against their ideological tenets. 
If we don't rise up in resistance against these political ideologies that have made such a terrifying resurgence of late - and do it PDQ - we will be reading more books like the Gulag Archipelago 50 to 100 years from now. Food for thought.....

I´m estonian, little country what was under soviet occupation since 1945 till 1991, country where Solzhenitsyn actually wrote final version of Gulag Archipelago and for us its absolutely elementary knowledge, that World War II biggest crimes were committed by Stalin. Half of the Siberian current cities, roads etc are built by political prisoners between 1939 till 1959. Cities like Norilsk, Krasnojarsk, etc etc. Half of them prisoners died because all siberian camps were prison camps, with minimal food. People got like 400 to 600 grams of black bread a day and had to not just work, but fulfill a daily plans. Living often in tents or baracks in conditions were there was minus 50 or even more Celsius at winter etc etc. 

Most of prisoners were political prisoners, and most of political prisoners were absolutely innocent. By default were deported to prison camps all those, who lived in a house or a farms, children, old people, everyone. Also most of those about whom some bad neighbour made false complaint about being like I dont know... rich, or that he or she said something about soviet union etc. Of course were deported automatically all who were working to estonian government institutions, also military personnel, policemen etc. etc."

UgjNakQg6otIv3gCoAEC,Bryan Croteau,1504485259644,"Professor Peterson mentions the game Monopoly about 20 minutes into the video and talks a bit about coin flipping. This actually a fairly common example: it is included in the postscript speech by Warren Buffet at the end of ""The Intelligent Investor,"" and it is mentioned in Nassim Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness.""

In the case of Monopoly however, the coin flipping explanation is actually only half of the picture. The other element, Positive Feedback, is a core principle of game design. The more property that you have in Monopoly, the more people give you money, and the more property you buy. It's a virtuous circle. The random element of Monopoly really only applies to the first few turns. Once the leading player starts to snowball, the game might as well end, because it is almost mathematically impossible for that player to lose.

As Yuval Noah Harari points out in ""Sapiens,"" accident compounded by positive feedback explains most of history.

The optimal strategy in Monopoly is to simply spend money as fast as you get it so that you have a fair chance of snowballing. Anyone who does not participate in this strategy is not actually playing the game. This can be abstracted into a solution to the ""set of all possible dominance hierarchies"" problem in the following way: people who do not invest 100% of their resources into future growth are simply not playing the game."

""I have seen the unshakable strength of the idea of social good that was born in my own country. I saw this struggle during the period of general collectivization and again in 1937. I saw people being annihilated in the name of an idea of good as fine and humane as the ideal of Christianity. I saw whole villages dying of hunger; I saw peasant children dying on the snows of Siberia; I saw trains bound for Siberia with hundreds of thousands of men and women from Moscow, Leningrad and every city in Russia - men and women who had been declared enemies of a great and bright idea of social good. This idea was something fine and noble -yet it killed some without mercy, crippled the lives of others, and separated wives from husbands and children from fathers.

...Yes, as well as this terrible Good with a capital ""G"", there is everyday human kindness. The kindness of an old woman carrying a piece of bread to a prisoner, the kindness of a soldier allowing a wounded enemy to drink from his water-flask, the kindness of youth towards age, the kindess of a peasant hiding an old Jew in his loft. The kindness of a prison guard who risks his own liberty to pass on letters written by a prisoner not to his ideological comrades, but to his wife and mother.

The private kindness of one individual towards another; a petty, thoughtless kindness; an unwitnessed kindness. Something we could call senseless kindness. A kindness outside any system of social or religious good."""

There are empowered and powerful cultures that have WAY too much influence and control over the last 50 or more years.

Now we fight wars for them, believe them to be the most moral, brilliant and valued culture. They protect their arrogance by claiming to be perpetual VICTIMS - and as paranoid narcissists, they hate and want to dominate all OTHERS - and they are the same culture that CONQUERED RUSSIAN IN 1917 AND KILLED MILLIONS RIGHTEOUSLY and seek to hide that incredible history.

I watched one the other day and then one popped up in my recommended videos today so I clicked on it and just followed the trail until this video came up. I find it pretty funny that I ended up watching this when earlier this evening I spent some time googling ""how not to be a nihilist"" because I'm surprised that I feel like one. I've been an optimistic person throughout most of my life...I'm not sure if it's just a bad case of caregiver burnout or what, but I definitely don't know how to live with the same sense of purpose and intentionality as I used to have. This lecture is certainly food for thought! How can I get you as my therapist????!!!! I guess I'll start by finding the will to attempt growth...maybe. Always feels like 1 step forward, tied to a strong bungee cord, then another step as I feel the tension increasing...then I snap backwards about 11 steps and land in a heap on the floor--disoriented and disheartened...so hard to want to try again when it seems so likely to end the same way each time. My husband says we should take the plunge and do the Self Authoring course...maybe if we do it together it'll be more useful. Here's hoping, because we have three amazing kids who already live in a bunch of stress and anxiety with basically only us to rely on to break the cycles."

UgiB1v575P-uHHgCoAEC,peter hughes,1504485284385,"I had a Marxist high school teacher in the 1980s. By coincidence my brother had a co-worker who boarded at this teacher's house. Turns out this socially-just Marxist was charging this immigrant TWICE the going rate of a 1 bedroom apartment for just a bedroom (no meals). So my brother helped him move out. That is Marxist logic - from each according to his ability (single unmarried guy with disposable income = high rent) to each according to his need (hey my mortgage is high so I need your cash). 
This Marxist teacher also told me he was for unilateral disarmament because it would be better for the USA to be incinerated than continue consuming the world's resources.
Soon after the Berlin Wall collapsed and I thought this crazy ideology would collapse too. 
Thank you Jordan Peterson for shining light onto these pernicious beliefs and illuminating the younger generations to the true history of the Soviet Union."
UghAjED8-Xb_EngCoAEC,Michael Samo,1504485284401,"There is something therapeutic about Jordan Peterson's lectures. Last couple of years I can't rid myself from the notion that nihilism and moral relativism is rationally correct cause people always have inconsistencies and double standards. 

One of the things that made me thinking so is treatment and consumption of animals. I am not vegan however I can't escape the contradiction that deep in my gut I despise slavery but don't mind animals slaughtered by the billions for us to enjoy their taste. I could never reconcile this and other cases of moral inconsistency and outright hypocrisy. Even if I become vegan I still will know that there is 1001 things we do for our enjoyment that kill animals as a result. 

Philosophy won't help ether, for example  - one of the strong arguments for utilitarian moral approach is that it has actual objective measure - do things that cause the most amount of happiness and least amount of suffering. However there are lots of cases that acting in such a way will create nonsensical scenarios such as doctor killing a healthy patient to collect his organs and save 5 other patients that will die if they won't get the organs. So most of people will agree that some things are just wrong no matter what utility they have on a moral level. And I believe the reason for nihilism is that we just can't agree on what these things are, and  that over history some things that were completely fine now illegal and otherwise. 

What I understand from Jordan is that human psyche goes beyond such things as rationality and logic and concepts like good and evil, morality and ethics have very deep psychological roots that goes beyond rational and logical. Such things could be described by mythology and archetypes. And the reason why ideologies, no matter how rational they appear to be, will never be able to organize human society in a way that is compelling to human psyche is because the roots of morality and values go much deeper into unconscious mind. Just think for a second where our morality come from. It comes from our culture, it comes from our family, from our own judgement, from our motivation, from our notion of universal values and more so if you try to find a consistent moral theory good luck with that... 

I like one of his examples - He says that it is logical that life has no meaning, but as a human being when you think about it you will probably have negative emotions. And the question is why would one think that nothing matters? Most of us will say - well because it is true or that what science suggests. And what he says is that maybe the reason you believe that nothing matters is because it is the bad and negative part of your personality wants to believe it.. the part that want everything be measurable. And the more smart and intellectual the more these ideas have a hold on you. 
Joseph Gobbles was very smart and intellectual but it didn't hold him to become a minister of propaganda in the Nazi regime and actually it probably helped him to be as such."
UggzumnkW31fc3gCoAEC,Ornicar Ornicar,1504485284413,"Too bad he is blind to the same atrocities when they are committed by religions, in the name of archetypal myths. He is sharp but so partial to his local mythology. Someone as clever and interesting as he is should realise that the worst possible way to justify beliefs is to do so by faith, because that is when no confrontation is ever fruitful. When beliefs are justified with no argument whatsoever (""that is what I chose to believe"") then antagonistic ideas can never merge. That is why religions always split and never merge, as opposed to science, that produces worldwide shared representations. He is as convinced as any that rationality is the way things must be studied (otherwise he couldn't make a coherent lecture, or he couldn't explain why he works with the Big 5 without doing so rationally...) but he has to give that up every now and then to make room for his pet mythology, never mentioning the inquisition and religion wars, martyrdom, ritual mutilations, religious terrorism, obscurantism or theocracies. That really makes the whole thing sound like a personal and convenient interpretation of ambivalent and ambiguous legends. As if a morality could be cherry-picked from holly texts without pre-existing moral criteria in the reader's mind. Good luck with that. We've seen how well that goes, whatever the religion. Burning witches or beheading infidels. And modern Russia is not going to be nice either.

Ugh_cWL0rtMaKHgCoAEC,BigSmartArmed,1504485302523,"While I respect professor Petersons work and his stance on highly important issues of social decay, his  study of totalitarian regimes should have identified that Solzhenitsyn was a fraud, that Archipelago Gulag was a FICTIONAL NOVEL which was repeatedly disputed by scholars and most importantly by confirmed prisoners that survived those very camps.

Solzhenitsyn got his notoriety by being promoted by anti-Soviet CIA apparatus of the Cold War era, specifically by CIA run Voice of America radio,  the 5th column chipping away at the Iron Curtain.  

Solzhenitsyn was not only a literary fraud, but he was proven to write condemning accusation reports on his peers to NKVD, was known to have a wretched personality and low morals, giving him a psychological profile of a pathological liar.  These are not ad hominem attacks on his character, he did suffer a breakdown in combat and attempted to flee the battlefield, thus the reason for his incarceration, and while PTSD is well studied in our times, on the front lines of WWII Eastern Front it was a crime to abandon your position with out orders, as panic in the troops is the first enemy.  

Whatever psychological damage Solzhenitsyn suffered, and whatever decisions and actions he took due to his psychological breakdown are his personal issues, but his literary works are a fraud, a gross misrepresentation of historical reality, and at best could only be counted as his subjective expiriance through the distorted lens of PTSD trauma.  

The sad part is that there are countless of Russian sources that covered this in depth and it has been known for years, yet the myth of Solzhenitsyn's supposed literary achievements exists only in the West, as he is the darling populist poster child of how awful the totalitarian regime of USSR was.   

In personal reality, both of my grandfathers fought on the Eastern front, both were wounded in combat, both were captured as POWs, both survived German POW camps, and after multiple attempts both escaped and both made across front lines to friendly territory.   They were not executed, they were not tortured or sent to Siberia for cowardice.  They were interrogated at length, their documents and stories were checked extensively, but after information was confirmed they were given a choice of rejoining the ranks while retaining their full rank.  

I wish professor Peterson the best, and most of I wish him the fortitude to check his sources very thoroughly and from multiple angles."

Ugj9U-J5eWZ99ngCoAEC,LCD M,1504485313259,"Professor Peterson, I respect your work a lot, but you've been saying something that is not accurate.
You said the majority of the wealth always accumulate in the hands of a few, this is of course true when it comes to money and nominal value of assets, or when it comes to totalitarian regimes, but is definitely not true when it comes to free market capitalism (hence why so many have been lifted out of poverty in a system that more or less resembles free market capitalism).

But in a free market economy the wealth accumulated by the top is just a small fraction of the wealth outputted from them to the world.
Meaning, the top 1-10% do not own the majority of the cars, food, clothes, furniture, mobile phones, computers, etc... Those things (the wealth) is owned by the people, the top 1% only have the stocks of some of the companies producing all this wealth but not the wealth itself, and a lot of those companies are divided in shares that are owned by the people. 

I just would like to point that out, because the way you say it makes it sound completely unfair and as if there was a problem that needed solving, which is absolutely not the case, the problem has been solved and the solution is free market capitalism."
UgjkkHTvnrgIaHgCoAEC,Leopard-King,1504485313280,"Human all too human.  Men will protect their stalk come hell or high water.  

Under capitalism King Leopold the Second, a Belgian king, killed 15 million Africans in the name of establishing his rubber plant. The Congolese have no impressive written poetry to reference seeing that untold numbers of them who slaved away in these rubber plants had no hands.  That's right, little Congolese boys forced to harvest and tap rubber were maimed for not meeting daily quotas.  You must understand though they lived in Congo Free State so it's okay.  Venture capitalism is natural!  I have no problem with that, because ABSOLUTE VICIOUSNESS IS NATURAL, observe wolves.   A super pack wolves will  kill a surplus  that they will not eat or return to later to eat.  They do it because they can. 

I can weep about about sharks altering their migration patterns to follow the Atlantic slave trade routes.  They were so well fed from dead and sometimes living slaves.  They gorged themselves on the table scrapes of capitalism.  Ohhhh, can't tell my history because that is ""WHITE GUILT.""  Oooopsie.  Forgot, only certain suffering counts for legitimate consideration of political and economic formulation.

I love how people talk about genocide. Jews and Cambodians are still with us.  Great!  I love them both.  Really I do!  What about EXTINCTION though!  the Aboriginal Tasmanian people are EXTINCT!  The British colonialists wiped them out.  No more! Gone! Done! Capitalism!

The French Revolution was a MERCANTILE REVOLUTION.  What happened when the forces of unrestricted free market prevailed? THE REIGN OF TERROR.  That phrase was coined by the newly minted powers as they sharpened their guillotine.  Oh the Capitalists  know how to take heads too, literally!

Sorry Capitalism is not the good twin, it is just the successful one.   Successful does not equal moral.  Pimping is more lucrative than leaf blowing.  Heads of industry are largely pathological.  I need not defend that statement but simply underline it.  I am no Trump supporter, but he rightly called the banks and top investors he filed bankruptcy on ""killers"" in response to Mike Wallace's innocent portrayal of top level players that were stiffed by an exploited bank rule.  It takes a certain mentality, an one the spot, blood chilling, ruthless decision making ability to reach those rarefied spaces.  

Anyone who knows law, knows the real law is commercial law. This law can not be transgressed without a pound of flesh in return.

The truth is right wing oppression is the father of left wing radicalism.  That Indian woman was aggressive because she needs to be.  I am not saying she could have used more tact, but then again, how much tact did the Aboriginal Tasmanian have?  Oh yeah, we don't know because dead men tell no tales.  

I've seen this movie before.  Brown suffering is unhinged, unscrupulous, pampered, self-satisfied, vapid, and self righteous an can be chucked together with sexually confused people.  However white suffering peoples are wise with deep lessons to forged in the furnace of trail and turmoil. Lol, can't you see, can't you see, freedom TAKES TURNS.  I hate saying that, really I do.  I desperately want someone to prove me wrong.  However I have yet to see this done.  I want happiness, prosperity, freedom and unity with all peoples of the earth, but wants do not dictate the look or motion of reality."

What got me to click was Solzhenitsyn picture, and, being a history buff, I was swept in from the get go. I read the Goulag Archipelago in the early 1980s so your talk resonated quite a bit with me. Having recently read Cancer Ward, I'm about to undertake One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich.  

Early on, you talked about the fake factories and villages the soviets would set up to impress their foreign visitors, and it got me thinking about what the nazis did, in 1943-44, in the Bohemian small town (or camp-ghetto) of Terezin, near Prague, where they created a ""model Jewish city"", where, on June 23, 1944, the Red Cross delegates declared themselves so satisfied that they abandoned their next scheduled stop: Birkenau...

About May 1968, I lived it, in Montreal where I was attending grade 2 at Collège Stanislas (an off-shoot of a Parisian establishment of the same name), and where the students who were about to graduate occupied the school for an afternoon and 10-12 of them carried a teacher's Austin Mini up a dozen stairs into the school's main lobby, across the street from us. :-)

In closing, may I add that your 20th century totalitarian examples take root in earlier events. One such event happened in Florence, at the time of America's discovery, and right before the Reformation: Savonarole's Bonfires of the vanities."

Even if it wasn´t their own fault mostly, the world would still be better off without them. And were such horror only to befall them, I would feel no need to help them.
Thinking about this always strains my ability so view (all) humans as people and reminds me of my own darkest side. Because while on a rational level I can hold on to the Idea of the divine Individual, I can not muster up any sympathy. And while I would reluctantly do my part as soon as someone starts adressing the issue, I would never be the first to adress it.

I feel gratitude beyond telling for your bringing together in one meaningful place and time so many historical realities, literary masterpieces, and both frightening AND hopeful ways of understanding and acting in the world.  I feel I've just received an immense and challenging gift - such a distillation of Human Experiences & Observant People We CAN Learn From along with a large, realistic and practical ""menu"" of Things We CAN Actually Choose To Do in the face of the burdens to - quite possibly - make life better for ourselves AND for others despite our flaws and pain. Wow....thank you for generously sharing what you've most likely spent years or decades learning and considering, and for weaving it together in language that is clear - and for including so many stories and examples that really help clarify and illuminate meanings that are in many ways terrifying and yet still seem to leave the possibility, for each of us, of making useful, positive and helpful choices.  Boy do I wish there'd been professors like you ""back in the day"", but I'm so glad for today's young people, and for my older self & fellow cronies now, to be able to listen to what you are sharing.

Ugizaw0zjxRLqngCoAEC,shananagans5,1504485325839,"When I was in college my best friend had defected from the USSR. She was working as a translator for scientists assembling a small, portable nuclear reactor as part of a joint project with the US. 
I think lots of young people don't know, or believe how strict the USSR was. The entire group from the USSR was staying at an appt complex. They chose that particular complex because it had good security. The complex had a large wall around it with 3 exits. While at the complex they were free to go to the pool & the rec center etc. That's where I met my friend, but, there were Russian guards at every exit. Every morning, no joke, a prison bus pulled up & they all filed onto the bus to be transported to work. They were literally prisoners. Exactly like you see in the movies or the stories you hear about Olympic athletes in the 70's, they had minders that watched them 24/7.
Anyways, late one night my friend called me from a 7-11 that was about a mile from the appt complex. She told me she had escaped & she was defecting & wanted me to pic her up & help her hide. I got dressed & when I went out to the parking lot, the Russian minder actually stopped me & asked me where I was going. They new I had become friends with one of the people they were there to guard. He didn't speak English real well but it was clear to me he suspected I was up to something because I was leaving at 3 AM. I told him my mom was sick & needed my help. I got in my car & drove off in a different direction from the 7-11. I drove around for a while to make sure I wasn't being followed, then I went & picked my friend up. She told me she thought they didn't know she had defected yet. I told her abut the guy questioning me when I left. Then she freaked out. She immediately knew they talked to me because I was friends with her & I was leaving at an odd time. She knew they suspected I was trying to help her defect but they didn't have the power to physically restrain me. I really thought she was being paranoid, I just didn't believe they were watching their people that closely. I took her to one of my friends houses & I called another friend that lived in the appt complex. He looked out the window & they had all the Russian scientists lined up against the wall & the security guys were going through their appts & questioning them. They were looking for my friend that had just defected. 
She wasn't being paranoid. They knew we had become friends & they were watching me too. When I left late that night, they checked on my friend & found her missing so they were grilling everyone in their group at 3:30 AM. 
lol At that point I got paranoid. I was thinking if they were watching that closely they may have the phones in the appt complex tapped. They didn't but I had just called someone there & told them everything we had just done. I was explaining why I was calling at 3:30 AM & asking him to look out the window. Anyways, that possibility scared us & we moved her to another persons home. 
We did get her to the proper authorities in the next few days & she got political asylum & eventually citizenship. 
Anyways, the reason I tell this story is because if anyone believes life was good in the USSR they are fooling themselves. My friend & all the scientists were living in the US in an appt complex with Americans but they were being watched closely & they were essentially prisoners. Had my friend been caught before she got political asylum, they would have physically taken her back to the USSR & thrown her in prison.
Even 2 years later, she was in the car with me when I got pulled over. I had pushed a yellow light & got pulled over. She was so frightened of having an interaction with the police she broke down in tears & had a panic attack. The cop was very nice, he gave me a warning & was very polite. She said people in Russia get taken away & never seen again for less. 
Under Soviet rule, people were living in fear. 
Now, my friend is in her mid 50's & she is having issues with her bones because when she was young, she had long periods when she didn't get even basic nourishment & she grew up in Leningrad during a time when the USSR wasn't having exceptional issues. Even in the ""good"" times, food was hard to come by. 
The first time we took her to a US supermarket, it really was like what you see in the movies. She was floored by all the food & all the choices. She had never seen anything like that. She really was used to standing in line for hours to get whatever they had. 
When you see these things from the 70's & 80's it's 100% true. That isn't propaganda. 
People were living in fear, afraid they could be carted off for years for the smallest infraction. People were going to bed hungry, even during the good times. Hot water was a luxury & heat was not a given. Even in the 1980's she had never even seen an air conditioner. She had been in air conditioned buildings but to have AC in a home was something she had not even realized was a possibility prior to her coming to the US. 
To all you social justice warriors out there wanting socialism/communism are wrong. You are just wrong. It's an evil system that doesn't work. Even in the ""good times"" people suffer & in the bad times, truly evil things happen on massive scales. 
With many things in life, differing opinions don't necessarily mean one side is right & one is wrong. Communism vs. Capitalism is not one of those things. Communism causes human suffering. You CAN NOT deny that honestly. You are either fooling yourself or you are terribly ignorant of the facts."

Yeah, we all had a laugh about it.
Then I realised the man was right! The political discourse has been so dominated by identity politics, gay rights in a large part, that people get elected regardless of their competence. Competence is not discussed that much anymore, it is replaced with discussions about the candidate's ""moral virtues"" regarding ""oppressed people"". When all the election is about gay rights, a politician that would build proper dykes never gets elected.
Literally, our arguments about gay rights blinded us to the corruption in government."

The letters contain instructions for the captain of each submarine telling him what to do if the UK has been annihilated in a nuclear war.
They are called ""The Last Resort Letters"" and prime ministers are said to become white when they are given the task.
Each letter is then transferred to a dual key safe on each Trident submarine and is burned without opening whenever the prime minister changes in the UK.

You talked about writing your future, how do you think the PM feels as his wish in death controls the fate of millions of people !

I belonged to that environment, in which I was born, but when I tried to talk about that with my father, his reaction was vitriolic: I understood that his generation had been largely brainwashed and my questioning the goodness of Communism was the infringement of an untouchable taboo, the subversion of the moral legends on which the cultural left stands.

I would not try to live during such a period. look at how many slaves there are compared to the men enslaving them. why are humans such cowards? torture is so terrible but they are already torturing you... so this is what statism does to you - it makes you into such an helpless child that you take punishments from psychos and do nothing. perhaps the best thing to do in such a situation is to force the evil ones to murder you quickly least they turn you into another jesus christ who suffered with horrible tortures. suicide is salvation if you wish to escape from hell. it's scary how much the peoples of the USA already resemble the types of mindsets the russians had. fools! did you not notice how many people who have committed non-violent crimes are being imprisoned? oh wait, you don't care about that because they broke the law and are criminals... heh. and besides what could you do against a mindless and powerful bureaucracy? and what have any of us to do with the evils that we do not care about because they are not directly affecting us yet? woe woe woe to the man who does not obey god for he shall obey something infinitely inferior. but things can get a lot worse and what god is to most is just a devil and a fairy tail. apparently hitler took away all rights in about 2 months. things can get very bad very quickly. how perplexing it is to see human beings falling into such a deep captivity to techniques. for a mother to not even care about her children... this one is so lost that she basically has no soul. she is near completely mechanized."

Men of the West became soft, women instinctively sense this is a problem, because that means lack of alpha men. It expresses itself as a hatred for men.
Just like in marriage, when a husband fails to detect or react to wife's infidelity, she has contempt for him, and while she may continue to use his resources, she does not want to have his genes, because it is a genetic dead-end - his sons would likely be like him, he will pay for offspring that aren't his (thus her).
That also explains why feminists like islamists - they instinctively sense available alphas. 
Women like to be taken and ""abused"". Look how popular ""50 Shades of Gray"" is.
Men of the West are stupid, they criminalized normal male behavior, so needed for societal/cultural/civilizational continuation. This, plus commercial interests that control media (staring with barbies and princesses for little girls), that brainwash women into long years of education and then earning and spending and paying credit card interest on useless crap, making them waste their fertile years, together with islamic conquest of the West, spells doom to the West."

Ugxp8QhL0buNhPCB2th4AaABAg,Alien Worthreich,1534811190770,"I observe a couple of flaws in his argumentation. One of these is the general differentiation of ""nature"" vs. ""culture"" in the sense of a ""village in the jungle"". What is the exact difference between a village and an ant-hill? Philosophy? 
The differentiations Peterson assumes (without even mentioning) are questionable. However discussion of the arguments (which all lead to the assumption of a soul vs. instinct dualism) would actually shake the basis of Petersons argumentation. And we should never forget, that society is what we make out of it and it is not a ""god-given"" axiom. In one case of a group of baboons showed a completely altered (meaning peaceful and ""egalitarian"") way of  group-behaviour after all the dominant males were wiped out in an accident. The tragic case of the poisened meat proved rather fortunate for the group as such, as the death of the most dominant males did lead to the development of less aggressive behaviour.
This points rather into the direction, that evolution (at least with certain monkeys) seems to tend to even out structures of dominance hierarchies with time. Though, not being a baboon, Peterson might not have come this far yet.
And by the way: Almost all fatal injuries caused by snake-bites were actually inflicted to humans during their intent to kill the snake - so, Dr. Peterson, please go ahead ""stompin"", as you suggest."

UgymbmJoe96RNgExi-F4AaABAg,David Hannan,1533342390965,"Fascinating lecture but...Let me make sure I understand this: People should conform to the dominant culture and compete in the dominance hierarchy in order to avoid the fate worse than death of not being alpha, characterized here by the usual '40 year old man-child' stereotype (btw does that guy really exist outside of some sort of untreated disability or mental health issue we're still primitive enough to call a 'moral failing'?). But then at the same time, JP's  'intelligent' clients living supposedly model, successful lives high up on the dominance hierarchy are tortured so much by their own tyranical minds to the point of needing therapy? 

I'm not sure how these two depictions can be contrasted so easily as they're both about  different kinds of ''losers'. If someone is rich but unhappy are they not just another kind of loser to be despised with the others? (according to the philosophy being put fwd here). 

Could it be that there are more ways to enjoy this life and find fulfilment in it than competing in a dominance hierarchy? Could it be that humans are not lobsters? Honestly I love listening to JP's lectures, and I think he's quite brilliant, but I'm beginning to notice that while his inconsistencies are rare, they can also be massive.

I first thought it meant lecture 4 of 5 and therefore that the other videos (01/05, 02/05, 03/05 etc.) were missing which is very common for youtube playlists/series.

Ugx6XR3BLJ4hRWzfZRZ4AaABAg,Rick D.,1530663993939,"There are no perfect symmetries, there is no pure randomness. Therefore, Robert B. Laughlin's definition of emergence, "" a collective principle of organization that gives rise to a law, a relationship of measured things that is always true but the law vanishes away into nothingness when you examine little parts to see where it came from"" requires a slight alteration, because the relationship of measured things is always true to some degree of resolution beyond which, the truthfulness begins to fluctuate and then vanish. When we measure the coastline of England, the answer will depend on the length of the ruler we use. As we move towards smaller and smaller rulers or finer and finer scales, we are moving through the fractal iterations. At some point, the length of the coastline will begin to fluctuate. This is an emergent property and it is caused by the wind and the waves, time and tide. If we imagine that the coastline of England is the hidden structure of reality, and the length of the coastline is a physical law, such as the fine-structure constant, when we take a measurement at very large scales (increments of 20 miles) the answer will not fluctuate but as we move to finer and finer scales something magical happens, the answer begins to fluctuate. This is the uncertainty that physicist are up against. The fluctuation, or lack thereof is an emergent property. Also, as we move to finer and finer scales, the concentration of energy increases. The fractal nesting of ever increasing cycles of time are related to scale.
Stasis→process→chaos.
Sameness→perception→otherness.
Symmetry→motion→difference.
Truth→communication→randomness.
The idea here is that symmetry contains no movement, no process, it is completely still. A point with no dimensions, no scale, but in terms of information it is pregnant with possibilities."

I wonder if Jordan's son is of an extroverted personality. I'm generally introverted, and maybe these two pictures of mind is somewhat a symbol of that."

she is in bezerker mode having just slain a demon who would multiply as his blood spilled on ground. She decapitates the demon and drinks his blood to quench her blood lust.. 
to calm her rage Shiva the god of death and destruction (also her husband) lays on her path, whom she steps on and eventually calms down.
i could continue on the topic, but it would be better if you look her up and do some research on the mythology, symbolism,  and morals attached with the goddess kali and then use the story in one of your lectures.

So I get JBP's point that they aren't thinking about the den of sleeping lions and freaking out about the coming onslaught, but I disagree that discovering the future as we have is a bad thing, because we can do something about exactly the coming onslaught. 

One thing I do know about zebras is that I was at a farm that had a horse riding day, and kids mostly were getting put on horses or ponys and led around the internal perimeter of a yard. There was another adjacent yard which had open gates so there was free access to both yards. There were other horses that were not being ridden and just grazing and there was, I kid you not, a zebra. So  I had an excellent opportunity to observe.

What I was startled by was how freaked out the zebra was in comparison to the horses and ponys. This was the zebras territory, admittedly there were strange humans, but all they were doing was sitting on top of the zebra's horse buddies and not a single horse was making a fuss. But the zebra couldn't be more alarmed. It would put its head down, eat some grass, then dart off with it's head barely lifted from the ground. Stop after a few metres and eat some more, and repeat the process. There wasn't even necessarily any trigger. As in nothing in the environment had changed, the zebra just scampered away from it's stationary position as if it had been zapped by a cattle prod.

The strangest thing was even a horse would freak it out, a horse it had probably seen for weeks, at the very least the whole morning, and the horse getting near it would freak it out, even if the zebra was the one moving towards it! So even if the zebras are not freaking out non-stop because they are thinking about lions, I got to say JBP, they really are freaking out non-stop."

The more a psychologist—a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner—turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner ""desperateness"" of higher men, this eternal ""too late!"" in every sense—may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction—of his ""going to ruin"" himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness—from what his ""business""—has laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honor, admire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived—or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt great sympathy, together with great contempt, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence—reverence for ""great men"" and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honors the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them .... And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the ""God"" was only a poor sacrificial animal! Success has always been the greatest liar—and the ""work"" itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the ""work"" of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is reputed to have created it; the ""great men,"" as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars—the people then call them idealists—often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour ""faith as it is"" out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:—what a torment these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman—who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers—that they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do everything—that's a belief particular to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is—he finds that it rather destroys than saves!— It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that demanded love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send there those who did not want to love him—and that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is all love, all capacity for love—who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such knowledge about love—seeks death!— But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. —"

When ever Peterson talks about religion always take it with a grain of salt because he sometimes has no idea what he's talking about.

You'd think he'd actually do some research as to who Kali is and the story behind her standing on her husband Shiva. Or mention that those heads are demons she's slayed. He is only party right about her representation to be a personification of something to fear. She is there to terrify your demons and slay them! First this guy says she standing on a deity she just gave birth to, WRONG. Then says she's eating his intestines, WRONG. She just finished drinking the blood from the bodies of demons she slayed. Because she went mad with blood lust after slaying the demons and started slaying the innocent Shiva was sent and he laid on the ground and when Kali realized she was stomping all over her husband she got embarrassed and calmed down and returned to her Durga form.
She represents the dark and powerful side of women, something to worship, be afraid and respect. The demon represents the never-ending evil and that sometimes, we have to dirty ourselves to fight the evil, which in this case she took a terrible form and drank blood. Also, Shiva calming her down through trickery, shows how hard it is to bring back an enraged woman to senses."

Ugweb0GCguNL7v1FSPF4AaABAg,Vasu Srivastava,1515025612074,"""Kali is one the 9 forms of Goddess Parvati - the wife of Lord Shiva in Hinduism. The man over whom she was stepping was Shiva. The story goes that once there was a demon who went by the name, ""Raktbeej"". It translates to ""Blood Seed"". He was killing people and Gods and the Gods [mainly the Indra and his major companions - Agni, Vayu, etc.] were unable to defeat him because he had this extraordinary ability to regenerate himself from a mere drop of his blood on Earth - hence the name. The Gods went to Parvati for help to which she inclined. That form she took was to kill that demon. All those heads, were his. She became so enraged during the battle that she became Kali - death itself in a sense. She chopped off the heads one by one of that demons multiple form and didn't let a single droplet of blood on ground. She drank it. However, by the end of the fight she lost herself to the point that Gods feared they're next and the earth will be destroyed. So they went to Shiva to ask him for help. When Shiva came to her she pinned him down as well only to instantly regain her senses that's it is her husband she is about to kill"".

You might want to look into Hinduism more closely, sir. Though I don't know how it's possible to even do that considering the amount of books it has and the extraordinary decentralization of authorities or doctrines."

UgyYFRXDCe5ynW4KW3J4AaABAg,ChrisC,1504484835402,"Odd errors with respect to some of the gods you mention.

Isis was not particularly associated with the underworld. It's true that she was Osiris' wife, and Osiris was king of the underworld, and so I suppose she was ""queen of the underworld"" in that sense, but it wasn't her primary association. In fact, by classical times she was much more often addressed as ""Queen of Heaven"". Going back to her origins she was a personification of the royal throne. Her name means ""throne"" and the object on her head is a representation of a throne.

Kali was often depicted with a sunken belly, but it's not because she had just given birth. She was often depicted as emaciated; it was an element of her horrific appearance. The person upon whom she steps, and in that one case whose entrails she devours, is her consort Shiva. The protrusion of her tongue is a gesture of embarrassment, when she realizes what she has done in her frenzy. In Tantric thought she represents the shakti, or energy, of Shiva, without which he is incapable of any sort of action, rendering him a corpse."

Even the Disney film followed this tradition by having the same actor voice both characters, even though they drew them to be quite distinct. The 2003 film also observed it.

NB: ""Peter Pan"" was a play before it was a novel, based on a character from an earlier novel. So the theatrical tradition is of very long-standing."

UghQF450SgAjVHgCoAEC,Catreece MacLeod,1504484835495,"This has been bothering me for awhile in your lectures - the use of the word ""chaos"" in a way that doesn't really work.

For example, on this one at 1:04:00 , the discussion turns to the idea that most people will want someone who is a bit unpredictable, but not too much so, and then you immediately move into how they don't want chaos.

The thing is, chaos is exactly what they want. Chaos isn't completely random, but rather it's structured and ordered, yet unpredictable. In the more scientific definition, it's defined by an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, or sensitive to new data, so that even tiny changes dramatically alter the outcome, but always in a way that makes sense. You may be able to partially predict sort of vaguely which direction it may go, and isolate the confines within where it could be, but you can't pin down exactly what will happen.

As such, I think it'd actually be vastly more accurate if you said that people are, in fact, actively seeking a state of chaos. They want things to make logical sense, yet they still want to be surprised. They want order, but they want freedom within the boundaries of order.

Anyway, if you use the scientific definition of chaos, the concepts you're trying to describe which rely upon the term ""chaos"" make an awful lot more sense if you don't use chaos in the way you've been using it. In fact, usually the way you describe ""order"" isn't order in the rigid sense, but order in terms of... well, chaos. The point is just that any time you bring up order and chaos, your definition of order always seems to leave you grasping for a better word for what you're trying to describe. And the word you're looking for is chaos, because it perfectly describes what you're trying to define.

While it may seem like nitpicking over terminology, it's really not. Understanding chaos as ordered and organized, yet unpredictable beyond a limited framework is immensely helpful just as a tool for thinking about very complex concepts such as the ones you cover. Randomness is not the same thing as chaos, and while they're often used interchangeably, they operate very differently to one another. This distinction is something I've come to realize is at the heart of a lot of problems within the tabletop role playing game industry for example - the failure to distinguish between chaos and random chance, and the conflation between the two, leads to designers often relying on dice, cards, or other methods of instilling randomness into given system. The problem there, is that they don't want random chance, they want to add chaos, and the failure to understand the difference between the two, presuming them to be the same thing, leads to significantly less effective gameplay cycles.

Given how you almost invariably run into issues with trying to describe what you mean once you start talking about order and chaos, it may be helpful to start thinking about chaos as a particular subset pattern of order.

Anyway, not trying to tell you how to teach your class or anything, just noticed you always seem to struggle when you get into that particular topic of order vs chaos, and I believe it may help you substantially to rethink your definition of chaos. Most of your arguments make substantially more sense when you make that change.

Otherwise, thanks for your work and uploading such so that we have access to it! Please continue to do so in the future!"

You manage to do it in a comprehensive way which helps develop a better understanding of these concepts, but at the same time you do it without asserting objectivity onto an innately subjective framework, and in doing so you apply a sense of rigor which is so painfully lacking in the psychological sciences.

I study mathematics and spend several hours a day (on weekdays mostly) studying different problems, and working towards my own perceived end-goal, and in doing that it's very easy to get into a rut of thinking within a logical framework that is too tight.
This kind of thinking often leads to severe stagnation in my work, and can be seriously demoralizing. Because of that, it's certainly helpful to take a break and focus on things that are far less logically rigorous, but that still have substance to them, and that still require some semblance of thought.

UgiCK2786hpBWHgCoAEC,Davito2000,1504484860149,"I K-Holed during my wisdom teeth extraction over a decade ago, (I thought it was a NDE, but it was likely a result of Ketamine and Nitrous Oxide. But who knows? There is a lot in common.), and it was the single most profound experience of my life. Everything went like your conventional out-patient procedure: slowly drifting away into a deep sleep... but then I woke up inside myself. The drowsiness was gone and I was completely cognizant, but I had no control over my body. Then, after some time, came a wave of euphoria, ecstasy, and unconditional love followed by the opening of a vortex. All bodily sensation slipped away: there was no need to breathe, there was no pain, there was no fear. The only desire was to be closer to the source of this feeling, which I posited as being God. All those stories in the Bible of people singing praises for eternity at the Throne seemed painful and torturous before, but if they felt this, then it was the least that was due. The contentions of the material world? Frivolous. Lust, hunger, desire for material wealth? Nonexistent. There was only a palpable sense of love, understanding, and of going home. 

And then I came back. Everything hurt, breathing was hard. Emotion was a shallow thing in the material world; only anger and sorrow were more pronounced, and they hurt too. I'm not ashamed to say that I had to fight back tears. If babies feel this coming into the world, I understand why they scream so. If what I felt was even remotely accurate to what it's like beyond the mortal existence, then the concept of reincarnation is torturous. This life is only rich in suffering and all that is good is deafened compared to what I felt. I suppose I still see it as equivalent to a NDE, being as alien as it was. Even the most rich of dreams and the most vivid and exciting of life's moments cannot compare."

Ugiu3B5X9EVJJHgCoAEC,Ruzzell Crowe,1504484870109,"Ayahuasca is a tea made from many many many different recipes. Some doesn't even contain DMT at all. 

How they made it is not secret at all. 

All you do is boil and filter the product, the more you filter it, usually with a cheese cloth, the more potent the brew becomes. 

As far as transporting people to another world... that's absolutely incorrect. 

Also, Rich Strausmans' research specifically says that he NEVER found DMT in the pineal gland in the human brain. Which he autopsied 4 I believe. 

As far as I know, DMT even in large doses doesn't manifest a delirious state of mind like a Jimsonweed can. 

But instead, manifests visual, and auditory, hallucinations, particularly in the form of Egyptianized graphics. 

The big difference is the person in a delirious state truly believes and doesn't know what is happening to them. 

While the hallucination from DMT whether smokes, snorted, injected, or eatin still see's reality and can navigate their surroundings perfectly fine. But will focus highly on certain texturized things and come to the realization that those texturized things are alive and moving. 

If you look at glass, plastics, smooth surfaces, if they aren't textured, they generally don't change at all. 

If you look at curtains, carpet, light, trees, etc, the mind will create life like beings out of them. 

A shaman can help control moods with music and ceremonies with people under the influence of hallucinations. 

The shaman is the puppet master, while the people under the influence are the marionettes. 

The human body is always trying to maintain homeostasis. 

And when you introduce to much of an artificial drug such as DMT, which I believe is metabolized into Serotonin and Dopamine the brain tries to understand reality - by creating faces and finding patterns in things that aren't normally realized.

You are correct in the reports of people being ""blasted"" out of their bodies and most people DO seem to encounter the same beings. 

I believe this is because of influence and expectation the user has before taking the drug. 

And you have to some how describe your ""trip."" 

Well, most people taking DMT aren't well educated in the grammarian sense. So if you understand that along with influences and expectations, sure they are ""blasted out of their bodies."" 

I was never blasted out of my body. 

The first dose  of 700mg of CHANGA (a massive dose) I specifically seen a neon blue digitized computerized beach ball globe appear and spin clockwise above my stomach as I was laying in bed. As I watched this sphere rotate, I noticed my two closet doors turn blacker than black, and kind of like in Star Trek did a warp drive  funnel movement and become outlined with the same neon blue digitized graphics. Kind of like an etch a sketch, the neon blue formed and outlined the edge of the doors and then created inside the doors a totem pole of digitized heads that where spinning clockwise and constantly changing faces. As I watched, I begin to notice that these digitized neon blue graphics are actually little microscopic beings that are popping in and out of existence at will and creating mechanical things from their own speech and just living life however they wanted - some would created spaceships and fly around popping in and out of existence, and others cars, and others balloons, and they would pop the balloons and they would pop themselves like balloons, and come back together and turn themselves into all kinds of different mechanical like things, but all made of this neon blue light substance material. And during this time I got the sense they are talking to me telepathically suggesting to me that I too can do what they are doing. And I talked backed to them. And then it all starts to fade away like a dream. 

Other experiences are different colors in the daylight, digitized snakes, and lots of Egypitianized graphics, and even some winged-like humanoid beings which could only be described as angelic, and the barrel of monkeys that spin like a kaleidoscope of colors."

UggEiaB0dkiAFXgCoAEC,genesisofsound,1504484925727,"Great video, but I'd like to offer a little more information from my perspective. At 1:21:00, when Jordan talks about the woman afraid of slaughterhouses, he mentions that you can't live in the world unless you reconcile yourself with the horrors of it. This is true, but this does nothing to say how we should act. I say this because I haven't found any philosophical defense in favor of eating animals, in so far as you are not constrained by specific health defects(lack of a particular vitamin only found in meat), poverty, or environmental barriers. The fact is, if you are a relatively healthy person living in the first world, it is not necessary for you to eat animals to survive. Granted, it is true that animals are killed in the process for making crops, but this is mostly irrelevant when considering that most of the meat we eat is grain fed as opposed to grass fed(97%). It was also interesting that Jordan mentioned morticians and their mental health, as it made me think of the mental health of slaughterhouse workers, which are very likely to develop issues when compared to other professions. All in all, it's something that I have been struggling with in my personal life in determining how I behave, at least with regards to my eating. The standard rebuttles to veganism always seem like appeal to nature fallacies, very unconvincing."
UggTvPk9NquvkHgCoAEC,Infinite Ronin,1504484925738,So... it just struck me around the end.  Jordan talks about a noteable correlation between snakes and the evolution of human sight and brain function.  And then there's a huge myth built on how a snake tempted humanity to increase its sight and awareness of sorts by eating from the tree of knowledge.  And the myth was made well before science was a thing.  So... weird coincidence?

Just a note, the glyph you depicted around 2h25m was not Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), but the Mayan interpretation of the same deity - Kukulkan. The specific glyph is taken from the city of Yaxchilan. Also, interesting that you related it to being a dragon, I guess it being a giant flying serpent that should be quite obvious, yet the archetype of the mythological dragon and Kukulkan are somewhat divergent from what I understand, which is very little. Quetzalcoatl (Kukulkan) is the 'feathered serpent', has numerous characteristics attributed to him, mostly by Western scholars reinterpreting ancient breadcrumbs, but one that stands out is the representation of fertility. A snake, duh, but also the scaly skin representing the parched earth, and then the feathers the new corn sprouts once the growing season initiates, which is also the part of the calendar associated with this deity. Corn being of course very sacred to both the Mehika (Aztec) and Maya."

In answer to your question, a fundamental difference as opposed to a difference of degree with regard to human and animal consciousness, would be like that Descartes described, where man possesses an immortal soul, while animals are souless automatons.

Of course there are strong drives and urges which control our conscious actions, many or most of which are beyond our control but I think it is folly to assume that the dominance hierarchies in human society are in any way natural mirror images of those in the animal kingdom. The ability of the human mind to communicate ideas and make complex adjustments based on previous experience should surely make a simple appraisal of the human dominance hierarchies at least questionable when other factors are taken into consideration. In this respect the role of psychopathy and their cravings for power, combined with their ability to lie and a lack of conscience/empathy would undermine a straightforward view of the human dominance hierarchy.

19:44 ""being able to be cruel and then not being cruel is better than not being able to be cruel.""

I like the analogy you make to martial arts philosophy. Sure, they'll teach you to kick ass.. but it's for personal growth, discipline and self-defense, not ass kicking.

1:59:41 ""You go after the unknown. You don't protect what you know, you already know what you know. You go after what you don't know, that's why you have to talk to people you don't agree with. That's why you have to talk to your enemies cause they're gonna tell you things you don't know, you can even listen to them,  it's possible they know a thing or two you don't know. But people don't like that, they just talk to people who think the same way and then they just stay stupid."" 

OK so, this string of sentences, despite lacking rhetorical polish, is vital, in my opinion. It's a pleasure to witness it being taught in college in this day and age where the concept seems all but lost on campus. For this I can't possibly thank you enough. I feel more emphasis should be placed on it regularly. Running into people who disagree with you sharpens the intellect.  As a liberal it has helped me understand and even appreciate conservatives. An eagle can't soar with only one wing, after all. To continue the fun martial arts analogies, I imagine a martial arts practitioner constantly seeking a challenge in order to improve their skill. It is in the spirit of this concept that I make criticisms of your lectures. Not to undermine your expertise but to test my ability to 
recognize holes in arguments, including my own.

2:23:01 ""I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a variety of reasons. Partly because I think it's an extreme form of cowardice."" 

lol, impartiality (something a professor ""ought"" to employ :P) is out the window with that one. I'm admittedly taken aback at hearing this phrase spill from the lips of not only a philosopher but a philosophy professor.. in the middle of a philosophy lecture.. to philosophy students. I wish you would've elaborated more on precisely why you think this way. Unless your understanding of the definition of moral relativism has been shaped by theologians, I'm struggling with why you would not only think this way but advertise it to impressionable young minds. Will our ideologically charged societies really benefit from more generations of students who view philosophical concepts through a theological lens? Meh.. I suppose I should be thankful that you're not instructing your students to be cultural marxist SJWs.

I apologize if the following comes off as rude, it's not my intention. I genuinely respect your seniority and years of study in these subjects but.. why am I not seeing any students raising hands and asking questions? Would it be too utopian to suggest that a classroom should be featuring considerably more back and forth dialogue? Would this not be even more the case in a philosophy class? Perhaps there is a structure to ""lecture"" courses which is different than regular classrooms. What I often see when I watch your lectures is an hour or two of you talking which then concludes with applause. Are these classes or TED 
talks? I'm confused.. and somewhat frightened. Hold me. Either way, thumbs up for getting me to crawl out of my escapist hole for some mental aerobics."

I partially believe this, while of course this is EXTREMELY BAD advice in 98% of situations in life, or in anywhere your personal reputation is important, and you have a high chance of losing status that is important to you. I'm sure there are 100 ways to be assertive constructively, however there are 100 to the power of 100 ways to be assertive destructively, where you're lost in your own self-pity and say things you don't mean, to a person who doesn't deserve it, and they'll rationally tell you that you're wrong, and then you'll be twice as deep in the hole of resentment, because you can't control yourself, and don't understand why your emotions keep lying to you. OR the reverse, you DO find ways of making other people feel guilty, and they submit to your blame games, and you climb out of your resentment and believe your self-righteous bullshit and learn how to do that even better next time, and that seems even worse.
I'm not sure what situations you can speak out and make things better, but it probably is a trial-by-fire where you have to literally destroy 100 relationships you care about until you've learned enough ways to go wrong before you'll start doing it right. Family might be the best place to experment, or at least you can grovel later, and possibly deprocess a fight that no one understands.
Overall my advice is always start with a journal, although talking to an uninvolved friend who is UNLIKELY to agree with you might be faster learning. Then you can find a sympathetic friend if you need someone to take your side, so you'll still defend it. Talking to a person you resent really only works AFTER you no longer feel resentment and don't need the other person to change for you to feel better."

You can make it excruciating. You can take people apart physically and psychologically. And you can keep them right on the edge of death so you can keep doing that endlessly. That happens a hell of a lot more than you think. It happens a lot....""
This is a very bizarre claim, although perhaps being a clinical psychologist Jordan sees things the rest of us don't see, both on the ""victim"" and ""perpetrator"" side? For me, the opposite seems true, once you see how you can hurt someone else, you try harder to not do that, even if that approach also creates a too-great sense of responsibility for the pain of others, and some pain is necessary, like when someone else isn't facing what they know they need to face, you risk becoming an enabler to help them hide what they don't want to see in themselves.
The biggest problem I'd see isn't pure victims or pure sadists, but people who are mutually lost in a dance expressing and projecting failed parental roles back and forth, or where victims are trying to ""save"" an abusive person, and the abuser usually is someone lost in an addiction cycle, and taking out ""his"" frustrations on people close to him, against his own will, when the deserved chaos comes out of that.

In slaying negative desire she got out of control and her consort laid down at her feet to pacify her so she wouldn't destroy everything, including the good. She is also associated with time.

In any case, if she does have a ""terrible countenance"" it is directed towards evil and destruction of it, so she is a protector. The gods in Hindu polytheism are pretty much entirely benevolent. If you want an angry God, have to look towards Judeo-Christian stuff (including Islam). There may be other religious mythologies with this, but I'm not aware of it being in any of the other major ones (Buddism, Taoism, Shinto, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, etc.).

It also could be noted that the dragon referred to here is the European Dragon (evil but with a magical gift in blood or benefit/treasure from defeat). Very different from the typical Chinese Dragon that is a positive symbol of power and luck.

It will indeed bring you to the depths of hell, show you what lies there (within the deepest recesses of your subconscious), and then manages to draw it to the surface like a venom or poison. Shamanic initiation is a part of the old human way that should never have been lost."

Professor, from what I recall discussing the aspect of the snake in the creation story with my uncle, an archaeologist/historian with the University of South Carolina at Charleston, the snake is never referred to as satan in texts-- rather most research points back to this being a passed down smear against local snake cults in the ancient Mesopotamian region-- a rival god from another religion, tempting others from obedience to the 'true' faith. I've also seen a few documentaries whom have echoed similar. I appreciate the work you made in your interpretations"

Ughqb3sMzYRL1XgCoAEC,mark boggs,1504484996761,"2:30:20.  Chacruna is NOT required.  All they needed was the Ayahuasca (which looks like a snake climbing up a tree and raises your level of consciousness).  Plants like chacruna or chagropanga contain lots of ""dimethyltryptamine"".  However dimethyltryptamine is present in ALL living things.  You could use grass, it just will not work as well and take longer to brew. You need the Ayahuasca so that the other plant is not rejected by your body.  ...any other plant.  ...Jordan all this has something to do with the pineal gland.  I don't know what...

Everyone does NOT report the same thing.  At all... Different people see very different things...  

Yep, I have drunk it.  I saw my ""demons""... It should only be drunk in Peru with a Shaman.  LSD and other drugs are BAD. This is not the same... DMT on it's own IS NOT THE SAME...  

There was obviously a global religion of Shamanism in the past.  Organised religion has been hiding this from us for a long time...  This https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism proves we were lied to in the history books about science. So does the great pyramid."

UgglkOH73QUrOXgCoAEC,William Koscielniak,1504484996849,"Something just popped into my head when Peterson was talking about the Lion King, something relating to life and death and good and evil. We normally do NOT celebrate someone being killed, in fact we think of it as one of the worst crimes that someone can commit. But when we kill an ""evil"" person we celebrate it, and hardly notice that killing took place. So when Symba killed Scar we cheered, because good triumphed over evil. When Osama Bin Laden was killed, we cheered, because good triumphed over evil. In other words, we are more attached to our emotions of what people represent (good and evil) then the people themselves. We don't cheer that a human life was taken, we cheer that what that life represents was taken, namely that evil was vanquished (at least momentarily). Even many pacifists cheer the death of a tyrant. It's fascinating."

Ayahuasca looks like a snake sitting in a tree (of knowledge) and allows you to view your subconscious mind with your conscious.  That is why the shamans of Peru still tell the story of the garden of Eden today.
